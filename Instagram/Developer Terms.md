Meta Platform Terms
===================

1\. Introduction
----------------

*     
    a. The Meta for Developers Platform (“Platform”) is the set of APIs, SDKs, tools, plugins, code, technology, content, and services that enables others, including app developers and website operators, to develop functionality, retrieve data from Meta and any other [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=tos), or provide data to us.
    
*     
    b. To use Platform (including to Process any Platform Data), you agree to these Platform Terms (“Terms”), as well as all other applicable terms and policies. This may include the [Meta Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms), the [Instagram Terms of Use](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F581066165581870), the [Meta Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms), the [Business Tools Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools/), and any [Meta Product](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=tos) terms that are applicable.
    
*     
    c. You must also comply with the applicable requirements in our [Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/devpolicy/) and those made available on our [Developer Site](https://developers.facebook.com/), including in our [Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/) (collectively, the “Developer Docs”) and all applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to your collection, use, or other processing of Platform Data.
    
*     
    d. These Terms will start when you accept them or otherwise start accessing or using Platform, whichever date is earlier. If you are accepting these Terms or accessing or using Platform on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms and you agree on behalf of such entity to be bound by these Terms (and for clarity, all other references to “you” in these Terms refer to such entity).
    
*     
    e. If you fail to comply with these Terms or any other applicable terms or policies, we may suspend or terminate your App or account, as described below.
    
*     
    f. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein (including in Section 12 (“Glossary”) have the meaning given in our other terms and policies, including our [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) and our [Meta Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms). The term “including” means “including without limitation.”
    

2\. Intellectual Property Rights
--------------------------------

*     
    **a. Our License to You.** Subject to your compliance with these Terms and all other applicable terms and policies, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except to Service Providers as described below), non-transferable, non-assignable license to use, access, and integrate with Platform, but only to the extent permitted in these Terms and all other applicable terms and policies. You will not sell, transfer, or sublicense Platform to anyone. Except as expressly licensed herein, you will not use, access, integrate with, modify, translate, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, or otherwise exploit Platform or any aspect thereof. The [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678) reserve all rights, title, and interest (including the right to enforce any such rights) not expressly granted in these Terms.
    
*     
    **b. Your License to Us**
    
    *     
        **i. _Your Content:_**

        *     
            2\. If you use the Meta Business Tools to send us Business Tool Data, our use of that data is governed by the Business Tools Terms rather than the foregoing license for Your Content.
            
        *     
            3\. If you owned Your Content before providing it to us, you will continue owning it after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in these Terms or any other applicable terms or policies and any access you provide to others by sharing it via Platform.
            
        
    *     
        **ii. _Your App:_**

This license remains in effect even if you stop using Platform. Without limitation, the foregoing license includes the right to frame or link to your App, to place content (including ads) around your App, and to analyze your App (including to assess your compliance with these Terms and all other applicable terms and policies).
            
        *     
            2\. As between the parties, in connection with Platform, we won’t be subject to any terms or policies associated with your App or Your Content (even if we click or tap agreement). Those terms and policies are considered null and void and are rejected and excluded from these Terms.
            
        *     
            3\. Nothing in these Terms will be interpreted as a representation or agreement that we will not develop or have not developed apps, products, features, or services that are similar to your App or compete with your App.
            
        
    *     
        **iii. _Your Name, Trademarks, and Logos:_** You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use your name, trademarks, and logos for distribution, marketing, and promotional purposes, in connection with your use of [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139), in all formats and media. This license remains in effect for existing materials and instances even if you stop using Platform.
        
    
*     
    **c. Protecting the Rights of Others**

    *     
        ii. You will obtain (and represent and warrant that you own or have secured) all rights necessary from all applicable rights holders to (1) grant the licenses, rights, and permissions in these Terms (including those in Section 2.b (“Your License to Us”)); (2) display, distribute, and deliver all information, data, and other content in your App; and (3) otherwise operate your App. This includes satisfying all licensing, reporting, and payout obligations to third parties.
        
    *     
        iii. If your App contains content submitted or provided by your Users or other third parties, you must have an appropriate notice and takedown process and otherwise comply with all applicable laws and regulations to respond to notices of claimed infringement. Without limiting that compliance, in the United States, you must comply with all requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

    *     
        vii.
