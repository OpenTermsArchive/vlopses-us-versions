Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 5, 2026_

  

This Privacy Policy applies to TikTok services (the “Services”), which include TikTok apps, websites, software, and related services, accessed via any platform or device, that link to this Privacy Policy, as well as TikTok Ad Network. The Services are operated by TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC (“TikTok USDS Joint Venture”, “we” or “us”).

We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal information of users and other individuals in connection with the Services. For information about how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process consumer health data as defined under Washington’s My Health My Data Act and other similar state laws, please refer to the [Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/us-consumer-health-data).

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service).

**Information We Collect**
--------------------------

We collect your information in three ways: information that you provide, automatically collected information, and information from other sources. More detail is provided below.

### **Information You Provide**

When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Services, you may provide some or all of the following information:

*   Account information, such as date of birth, username, password, email, phone number, and profile image.
*   User content, including comments, photographs, livestreams, audio recordings, videos, and text that you choose to create, import, upload, or publish through our apps and websites. Even if you are not a user, information about you may appear in user content created or published by users on our apps and websites. We may collect user content through pre-uploading at the time of creation, import, or upload, regardless of whether you choose to save or publish that user content, for example, to recommend audio options, provide an effect, generate captions, and provide other personalized recommendations.
*   Messages, including content you compose, send, or receive through our messaging functionalities, including messages you send through our chat functionality when using our shopping features to communicate with sellers.
*   AI interactions, including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.
*   Clipboard content, such as text and images, accessed through your device's clipboard when you choose to use certain functions such as initiating information sharing with third-party services, or copying and pasting clipboard content onto our apps and websites.
*   Purchase information, including payment card information, billing, delivery, and contact information, and purchase history when you make a purchase, payment, or other transaction on or through the Services, including when you buy TikTok Coins or purchase products or services through our shopping features.
*   Your phone and social network contacts, with your permission. If you choose to sync your contacts, we will collect information, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses from your device’s phone book, and friends list from your social network, and match that information to users who have TikTok accounts. We also collect information about the accounts you follow and that follow you.
*   Your account settings and communication preferences.
*   Information to verify an account such as proof of identity or age.
*   Information in correspondence you send to us, including when you contact us for support.
*   Information you share if you fill in advertisers’ forms on our app, or through your participation in surveys, research, promotions, marketing campaigns, events, or contests.

Information You Provide may include sensitive personal information, as defined under applicable state privacy laws. We process such information in accordance with applicable law, such as to provide the Services and other permitted purposes under state privacy laws, like the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). You may choose whether or not you include sensitive personal information in your user content or in other information you voluntarily submit. The type of information that state privacy laws, such as the CCPA, have identified as sensitive personal information include the following: racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information. TikTok does not require you to provide this type of information. However, if you choose to publish user content about these topics, please keep in mind that such content may be visible to other users and the public, depending on your privacy settings.

In other situations, we may process your financial information in order to provide you the goods or services you request from us; your driver’s license number in order to verify your identity; and information from users under the relevant age threshold in order to provide an age-appropriate experience. We may also collect precise location data, depending on your settings and as explained below.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including:

*   Usage information, including information regarding your use of the Services, such as information about how you interact with content and ads, the duration and frequency of your use of the Services, and your engagement with other users. We also collect certain information about your interactions with websites when you use our in-app browser.
*   Technical information from your device, network, and application, including your IP address, user agent, mobile carrier, time zone settings, identifiers for advertising purposes, model of your device, the device system, network type, your screen resolution and operating system, app and file names and types, keystroke patterns or rhythms, battery state, audio settings and connected audio devices. We automatically assign device IDs and user IDs, and may use this and other information to identify your activity across devices.
*   Location information about your approximate location based on your device and network information, such as SIM card region, IP address, and device system settings. We also collect information, such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest, if you choose to add the location to your user content. Also, if you choose to enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate or precise location information from your device. You can turn off location services from your device settings at any time. Click [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/account-privacy-settings/location-services-on-tiktok) to learn more about how we collect location information.
*   Content characteristics and features, including about the videos, images and audio recordings that are part of your user content, for example, by identifying objects and scenery; the existence and location of a face and other body parts; and the text of words spoken in your user content. We may collect this information to enable special video effects, for content moderation, for demographic classification, for content and ad recommendations, and for other non-personally-identifying operations. We may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information as defined under US laws, such as faceprints and voiceprints, from your user content. Where required by law, we will seek any required permissions from you prior to any such collection.

*   Metadata that is automatically uploaded in connection with your user content, messages, or AI interactions, such as how, when, where, and by whom the user content was created, or message or prompt was sent. Metadata may also include information, such as your username, that enables your user content to be traced back to your account by other users.
*   Cookies and other similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, flash cookies, pixels, SDKs, etc.) that we and our service providers and business partners use to provide certain features and functionalities, including to measure and analyze how you use the Services, including which pages you view most often and how you interact with content; enhance your experience using the Services; improve the Services; provide you with advertising; and promote the Services on other websites and apps.

### **Information From Other Sources**

We may receive the information described in this Privacy Policy from other sources, such as:

**Your Rights and Choices**
---------------------------

You may submit a request to know, access, correct or delete the information we have collected from or about you [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy) or by sending your request to the physical address provided in the “[Contact Us](#contactus)” section below. You may appeal any decision we have made about your request through these same methods. Through your in-app settings, you can directly update your account information, request a copy of your data, or deactivate or delete your account by following the instructions for deactivation [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/deleting-an-account/deactivate-your-account) or deletion [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/account-and-privacy/deleting-an-account/deleting-an-account). We will not retaliate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some aspects of the Services may no longer be available to you.

You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to submit a request through an authorized agent. To designate an authorized agent to exercise choices on your behalf, please provide evidence that you have given such agent power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law and subject to proper verification. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or to provide information necessary to verify your account.

More information about requests that we have received can be found [here](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/california-privacy-rights-2024).

You can also control the information we collect and opt out of certain activities in the following ways:

*   You may be able to control some of the [Information We Collect](#informationwecollect) by refusing or disabling [cookies](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en#cookies) through your device browser settings. Because each browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your browser. Please note that you may need to take additional steps to refuse or disable certain types of cookies. In addition, your choice to disable cookies is specific to the particular browser that you are using when you disable cookies, so you may need to separately disable cookies for each type of browser. Some browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites. Because of differences in how browsers incorporate and activate this feature, we currently do not take action in response to these signals. Please be aware that if you choose to refuse, disable, or delete cookies, some of the functionality of the Services may no longer be available to you. Without this information, we are not able to provide you with all of the requested services.
*   If you have a TikTok account, you can navigate to “Ads” in your in-app settings to manage how your activity elsewhere online is used to serve you ads on our websites and apps. Using your in-app settings, you can also manage the ads that TikTok Ad Network serves you elsewhere online. If you do not have a TikTok account, you can manage the ads that TikTok Ad Network serves elsewhere online using the webform [here](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy), or through the ad notice that appears along with ads that are delivered by the TikTok Ad Network. Your device may have controls that determine what [Information We Collect](#informationwecollect). For example, you can control whether we access your phone contacts in your device settings.
*   You can opt out of receiving marketing emails by using the “unsubscribe” link or mechanism noted in those emails.

**Data Security and Retention**
-------------------------------

We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.

We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services and for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also retain information when necessary to comply with contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest to do so (such as improving and developing the Services, and enhancing its safety, security and stability), and for the exercise or defense of legal claims.

The retention periods are different depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information. For example, when we process your information such as your account registration information to provide you with the Services, we keep this information for as long as you have an account, subject to your updates of such information. If you violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), or other conditions or policies, we may remove you from the Services immediately, but may keep information about you to process the violation.

Subject to applicable laws, including Executive Order 14352 and any compliance obligations thereunder, we may transmit your information outside of the United States, for purposes of sharing with recipients as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Children and Teens**
----------------------

The privacy of children is important to us. We provide a separate experience for users under age 13 (“Child” or “Children”) in the United States, in which we collect and process only limited information. Please see our [Children’s Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/childrens-privacy-policy) to learn more.

If we become aware that a Child’s personal information has been collected outside of this separate experience for Children, we will delete this information in accordance with applicable law and terminate the Child’s account. If you believe there is a user of the Services who is below the age of 13 (excluding any users of this separate experience for Children), please contact us at https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/feedback.

As a parent or guardian, you can also request to delete the account of your Child or to download their data, by contacting us at [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy.](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy) Depending on your state of residence, you may also have the ability to exercise these rights over your teen’s account, or to exercise other rights in connection with your Child or teen by contacting us at [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy.](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy) We will address these requests in accordance with applicable law.

If you are a parent or guardian of a teen, our [Guardian's Guide](https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en/guardians-guide) contains information and resources to help you understand the Services and the tools and controls you can use.

**Other Rights**

### **Sharing for Direct Marketing Purposes (Shine the Light)**

If you are a California resident, once a calendar year, you may be entitled to obtain information about personal information that we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. To submit a request, contact us at: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy.

### **Content Removal for Users Under 18**

Users of the Services who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request and obtain removal of user content they posted by contacting us at: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy. All requests must provide a description of the user content they want removed and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate that user content. We do not accept California removal requests via postal mail, telephone, or facsimile. We may not be able to respond if you do not provide adequate information. Please note that your request may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the material. For example, user content that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user.

Users of the Services who are Connecticut residents and are under 18 years of age, and parents and guardians of users of the Services who are Connecticut residents under 16 years of age, may request that we unpublish or delete their own account (for users aged 13 through 17) or their Child’s account (for parents and guardians with teen users under 16) by following the instructions [here](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/for-parents-and-guardians).

Children's Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 1, 2024_

  

_For Children_
--------------

TikTok cares about your privacy. Children under the age of 13 in the United States can use TikTok in the Under 13 Experience (“Kids Mode”). When you use Kids Mode, we collect some information from you. This page explains what information we get and how we use it.

### **What Information Do We Collect from You?**

When you use TikTok, we collect some information about you. For example, when you set up a TikTok account, we collect your birthday, username, and password. We also collect some information from your phone, tablet, or other device you use, such as information about what kind of device you have, and information about the videos you watch. If you contact us with feedback or questions, we may collect your email address so that we can respond to you.

### **How Do We Use Your Information?**

We use your information to allow you to use and enjoy TikTok. For example, we use your username and password to let you access your account. We may use information about what videos you watch to show you additional videos that we think you’ll enjoy. We use information about your device to keep TikTok running smoothly.

### **How Do We Share Your Information?**

We may share your information with companies that provide support to TikTok.

We may share your information to keep you or others safe. We may also share your information to keep TikTok safe, protect our rights, and comply with law. We don’t sell your information or share it to target ads based on your activity across the services of different businesses.

### **How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?**

We have appropriate security protections to help keep your information safe. These protections help stop others from stealing your information or using it in bad ways. But online security is never perfect, so be careful when using online services.

### **Where and How Long Do We Keep Your Information?**

Some of your information may be kept outside the U.S. How long we keep your information depends on several things, such as the type of information and the reason why we collected the information. In general, we only keep your information as long as we need it.

### **What Rights Do You Have?**

You have the right to know, access, correct or delete your information. You can submit a request at [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/privacy) or by sending your request to the address provided in the “[Contact Us](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en#contactus)” section below. Depending on where you live, your parent or guardian can also make these requests for you. If you, or your parent or guardian, do make such a request, we will respond appropriately and will not penalize you for it.

### **Do You Ever Update This Privacy Policy?**

Yes, we may update this page from time to time, so please check back.

### **What If I Have Questions or Need More Information?**

For more information, please review the rest of this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian.

**_For Parents, Guardians, and Other Adults_**
----------------------------------------------

TikTok Inc. (“TikTok”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of children. This Children’s Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal information of users under the age of 13 (“Children”) on a separate experience of the TikTok services for Children in the United States (“Kids Mode”).

Kids Mode is designed for Children residing in the United States. It allows Children to engage with TikTok’s fun video features while limiting the information collected from them. Children can view videos from other creators and explore their creativity by capturing their own videos with music and special effects. While Children may save these videos directly to their device, the videos will not be collected by us or viewable by other users. Children also have a more limited interactive experience, including, for example, they cannot exchange messages with other users, and other users cannot view their profiles.

### **What Information We Collect from Children**

When a Child registers for TikTok, we collect only limited information, including username, password, and birthday.

We may also collect certain information automatically from the Child’s device, including internet or other network activity information such as device ID, IP address, web browser type and version, country-level location, as well as certain app activity information, such as video watches, time in the app, and general usage information.

If a Child reaches out to us via the in-app feedback form, we collect the email address that the Child provides solely for the purpose of responding to the inquiry.

While certain information we collect from children and subsequently use and disclose may constitute sensitive personal information under applicable state privacy laws, we only process such information in order to provide the Platform and within other exemptions under applicable law.

### **How We Use Children’s Information**

We use the information we collect to provide and support our services. For example, we use username and password to authenticate Children. We may use the information that is collected automatically to provide personalized content; serve contextual advertising; perform analytics and troubleshoot; protect the security and integrity of the user and our services; and ensure legal and regulatory compliance.

Children cannot publicly share personal information, including videos or profile information.

We do not engage in profiling which results in legal or similarly significant effects, as defined under applicable law.

### **How We Share Children’s Information**

We may share the information that we collect with our corporate group or service providers as necessary for them to support the internal operations of the TikTok service.

We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law (i) in response to a court order or a subpoena, or similar legal process; (ii) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (iii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, to facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of Children using our sites or applications; (iv) to protect the security and integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (v) to enable us to take precautions against liability.

TikTok does not sell information from Children to third parties and does not share such information with third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.

### **Data Security and Retention**

We make efforts to treat Children’s information securely and in accordance with this policy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we take steps to protect this information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the TikTok services; any transmission is at the user’s own risk.

We employ technical and organizational measures designed to achieve a level of security appropriate to risks of varying likelihood and severity and that takes into the account the rights and freedoms of users. We maintain these technical and organizational measures and will amend them from time to time to maintain or improve the overall security of our systems.

We retain Children’s information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected. The retention periods are different depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information.

TikTok may transmit Children’s information to its servers or data centers outside of the United States for storage and/or processing. Other entities with whom TikTok may share Children’s information as described herein may be located outside of the United States.

### **Your Rights**

A parent or guardian may submit a request to access or delete the information of their Child, as well as a request to appeal a decision we have made about such a request, by contacting us via the webform or the physical address provided in the Contact Us section below.

TikTok Ad Network Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 30 November 2025

  

This TikTok Ad Network Privacy Policy applies to the personal information that TikTok processes in connection with the TikTok Ad Network in the UK.

If you are a TikTok User (see below), see the TikTok Privacy Policy for information about how TikTok processes personal information in connection with your TikTok Account (see below).

**Data Controller:** TikTok Technology Limited, an Irish company (“**TikTok Ireland**”), and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (“**TikTok UK**”), a UK company, ("**TikTok**," "**our**," "**we**," or "**us**") are the joint controllers of your information processed in connection with this [Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy).

  

**What is the TikTok Ad Network?**
----------------------------------

The TikTok Ad Network is a mobile advertising network, including support systems and services, operated by TikTok (described below as “**TTAN**”). TTAN works with third parties (described below as “**Publishers**”) who want to sell advertising space on mobile applications that they own or operate or otherwise have the right to serve advertising on (“**Publisher Apps**”). TTAN connects these Publishers with advertisers who wish to deliver advertising on Publisher Apps. TTAN provides reporting to:

*   advertisers - to enable them to understand the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns on Publisher Apps; and
*   Publishers - to enable them to understand the performance of their advertising space.

Advertisements delivered to Publisher Apps through TTAN are shown to:

*   users holding a TikTok account (“**TikTok Users**” with a “**TikTok Account**”); and
*   individuals who are not TikTok Users.

TikTok participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework in respect of TTAN and complies with its Specifications and Policies.

**What information TTAN collects**
----------------------------------

We collect your information in three ways: [Information You Provide](##info), [Automatically Collected Information](##auto), [Information From Other Sources](##info-from). If you are a TikTok User, where permitted, we also use your [Information From Your TikTok Account](##info-tiktok-account). More detail is provided below.

### **Information You Provide**

*   **Information When You Contact Us.** When you contact us, or provide feedback, through forms, via email, or otherwise, we collect the information you send us.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

*   **Data from Publisher Apps.** When you interact with a Publisher App, we collect and process certain device and network information. We collect information automatically from your device using our software code (referred to as a “software development kit”, or “SDK”) which the Publisher has integrated into that Publisher App. We process device-specific identifiers such as mobile advertising identifiers (such as the "Google Advertising ID" on Android or the "ID for Advertisers" on iOS devices and similar) in order to create or match an identifier that is unique to your device. In addition, we also collect other information including your IP address, device model and price, operating system (i.e. iOS or Android) and version, internet service provider, mobile country code, mobile network code, mobile carrier, language settings, time zone, connection type (such as cellular or WIFI), connection speed (such as 4G or 5G), screen resolution, the time your device was last updated and started, as well as diagnostic performance information, including crash reports and performance logs. We also collect information about the privacy choices that you make on these Publisher Apps. We process information that we received from Publishers as a joint controller with them. [Learn more](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/business-products-terms) about our arrangements with these partners.
*   **Usage Information.** We collect information about your activity on Publisher Apps including the name of the Publisher App that has integrated TTAN and your interactions with any advertisements we deliver on Publisher Apps (e.g. information about the ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where and when the ad was served).
*   **Age-Range and Gender Information.** We assign an age range and gender to each user. We do not infer age range and gender based on personal information collected about you. Instead, we work this out using a mathematical formula that reflects the UK population overall.
*   **Location Information.** We determine your approximate location based on your IP address, mobile country code and mobile network code.

### **Information From Other Sources**

*   **Advertising and Measurement Partners.** Advertisers and measurement partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of Publisher Apps on advertiser websites and apps including the pages you visit, whether you download an app, and the products or services you purchased. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising which we use to help match you and your actions on advertiser websites and apps with your TTAN profile. Some of our advertisers and other partners enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our [TikTok Advertiser Tools](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertiser-tools-and-related-terms?redirected=1) (such as TikTok Pixel) - for more information, see [Cookies](##cookies). These partners are required to have the necessary rights and permissions to share your information with us before doing so. We process certain information that we receive from advertisers as a joint controller with them. [Learn more](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/business-products-terms) about our arrangements with these partners.

### **Information From Your TikTok Account**

*   Where you are a TikTok User we will access and use certain account related information connected to your TikTok Account in connection with TTAN (“**Account Data**”):

*   Whether your TikTok Account is associated with an under 18 or 18+ age status, as well as information about your privacy choices.
*   General location information from your TikTok Account.

*   Where you are a TikTok User, where permitted, we will also access and use certain additional information connected with your TikTok Account in connection with TTAN (“**Shared Data**”):

*   Inferred information associated with your TikTok Account, including inferred age-range, gender and interests.
*   Usage information, including how you interact with ads shown in your TikTok Account (e.g. clicks and views).
*   Information from advertisers and measurement partners (including via our [TikTok Advertiser Tools](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertiser-tools-and-related-terms?redirected=1)) about you and the actions you have taken on advertiser websites and apps connected with TikTok, including the pages you visit, whether you download and install an app, the products or services you purchased and other events.

  

**How We Use Your Information**
-------------------------------

We use your information in connection with TTAN as outlined below. You can find more detail in “[Our Legal Bases and How We Process Your Information](##our-legal)”.

*   Review, save and communicate your privacy choices.
*   To create personalised ads profiles and show you ads on Publisher Apps based on those profiles.
*   To limit the number of times an ad is shown to you and sequence the order in which ads are shown to you.
*   Create analytics reports so that advertisers can see how their ads are performing and better understand their audience, as well as to report to Publishers and ensure that we and our Publishers are paid accordingly.
*   Review, improve, and develop our services, including by monitoring interactions and usage, analysing how people are using the service, and by training, testing, and improving our technology, such as our machine learning models and algorithms.
*   Ensure the security of TTAN, detect and prevent fraud, and fix errors.

**Our Legal Bases and How We Process Your Information**
-------------------------------------------------------

We may only use your information when we have a “legal basis” to do so. We use different legal bases depending on why we use your information (in other words, the “purpose” of our processing).

Publishers participating in TTAN will present you with a consent management platform within each Publisher App. These consent management platforms provide you with information about the purposes for which your data will be collected and used and allow us to establish a legal basis for those purposes.

To provide you with a familiar approach that aligns with best industry standards, Publishers are required to use a consent management platform that complies with the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework.

**Our Global Operations and Data Transfers**
--------------------------------------------

To support our global operations:

*   We store the information described in the “[What Information We Collect](##what)” section in servers located in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore.
*   Certain entities in our Corporate Group, located outside your country of residence (see below), are given limited remote access to the information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)”, so they can provide certain functions, as described in the Our Corporate Group section in “How We Share Your Information”. This access is limited, secure and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and authorisation approval protocols.
*   We share “[What Information We Collect](##what)” with service providers, partners and other third party entities, as described in “How We Share Your Information”. These third parties can be located outside your country of residence.

These entities commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.

When we transfer your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

*   Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation) or [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to some countries with adequacy decisions. This includes where certain entities in our Corporate Group located in [Canada](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/2002/2\(1\)/oj/eng)**,** [Israel](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0061)**,** [Japan](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.076.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2019:076:TOC) and [South Korea](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/decision-adequate-protection-personal-data-republic-korea-annexes_en) are granted limited remote access to information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to provide important functions; or
*   Article 49. In the absence of an adequacy decision, we rely on Article 49 (1)(b) and (c) GDPR to transfer purchase information to sellers and transaction fulfilment providers in countries without an adequacy decision when necessary to provide shopping features to facilitate the purchase and delivery of products, goods and services, or to process your orders; or
*   Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved [contractual clauses](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e60b1cd4-d802-44d5-9cac-ddd3c943a5ef_en?filename=1_en_annexe_acte_autonome_cp_part1_v5_0.pdf) under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the [UK](https://ico.org.uk/media2/migrated/4019539/international-data-transfer-addendum.pdf) and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to certain entities in our Corporate Group and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision. This includes where we provide our Corporate Group entities in the United States, Malaysia and Singapore with the information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” under standard contractual clauses so that they can store it on secure servers for us. It also includes where certain entities in our Corporate Group located in Australia, Brazil, China, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and the United States are granted, under standard contractual clauses, limited remote access to information described in “[What Information We Collect](##what)” to provide important functions.

For a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in the “[Contact us](##contact)” section below.
