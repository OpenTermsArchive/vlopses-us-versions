**Promoting a brand, product, or service on TikTok**

  
You can post content that promotes a brand, product, or service on TikTok. This includes:  
•  Promoting yourself or your own business.  
•  Promoting a third-party brand or its products or services in exchange for payment or any other incentive.  
  
When posting content that promotes a brand, product, or service on TikTok, you must [turn on the content disclosure setting](#5). This ensures that you're transparent about the type of content you're posting and helps build and maintain trust between the TikTok community and advertisers. It can also let people know if a commercial relationship exists between you and a brand, if applicable.

**Requirements for promoting a brand, product, or service**

  
When you post content that promotes a brand, product, or service, your content is required to:  
•  Adhere to our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), [Branded Content Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/bc-policy?lang=en) (if applicable), and all applicable laws and regulations.  
•  Have the [content disclosure setting](#3) turned on. If you don't display the proper disclosure, we may remove or restrict your posts.

**What is the content disclosure setting?**

  
The content disclosure setting allows you to add a disclosure to your post to clearly indicate that your content is commercial in nature. This includes content that promotes a brand, product, or service, whether you're promoting your own business or posting branded content on behalf of a third party, such as a company.

  
**Why should I use the Content Disclosure setting?**

*   **Organized analytics:** Organize and track brand partnership analytics in one place.
*   **Showcase results:** Share performance stats with brands easily.
*   **Simplify Spark Ads:** Streamline the ad approval process.
*   **Stay compliant:** Ensure your content meets FTC and TikTok guidelines.

###   
  
  
**What happens when you turn on the content disclosure setting?**

  
When you turn on the content disclosure setting, you'll be asked to indicate what type of content your post contains.  
•  If you're promoting your own brand or business, your post will be labeled as **Promotional content.**  
•  If you're posting branded content on behalf of another business, your post will be labeled as **Paid partnership.**  
  
Note: Turning on the content disclosure setting won't affect the distribution of your post in feeds on TikTok.

###   
  
  
**How to turn on the content disclosure setting**

  
You can turn on the content disclosure setting before or after you post your content and when you go LIVE. Keep in mind that once your post or LIVE is published, it will be labeled as **Paid partnership** or **Promotional content** and can't be changed. If you made a mistake in how you disclosed your content, you can remove your LIVE or post and create a new one with the correct selection.

**Why should I tag a brand partner?**

• **Easy Discovery:** All brand partner tagged content will show up in **Content Suite** for brands to easily find and activate as Spark Ads in their ads campaigns.

• **Ads Authorization:** By tagging a brand partner, creators can preemptively provide ads authorization for paid ads usage.

• **Post Insights:** Once creators tag a brand partner, the brand will be able to have access to asset-level post insight analytics via Content Suite, similar to what creators see in their video analytics.  
  

**What does tagging a brand partner do?**

When you tag a **brand partner** in content disclosure settings, in addition to easier discovery by brands, you can grant ads authorization (60-day by default) for easier activation as an advertiser ad—in addition to anchor authorization, which allows a brand to add their applicable links to the video for their campaign.
