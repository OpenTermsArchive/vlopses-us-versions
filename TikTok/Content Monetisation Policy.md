**Promoting a brand, product, or service on TikTok**

  
You can post content that promotes a brand, product, or service on TikTok. This includes:  
•  Promoting yourself or your own business.  
•  Promoting a third-party brand or its products or services in exchange for payment or any other incentive.  
  
When posting content that promotes a brand, product, or service on TikTok, you must [turn on the content disclosure setting](#5). This ensures that you're transparent about the type of content you're posting and helps build and maintain trust between the TikTok community and advertisers. It can also let people know if a commercial relationship exists between you and a brand, if applicable.

###   
  
  
**Requirements for promoting a brand, product, or service**

  
When you post content that promotes a brand, product, or service, your content is required to:  
•  Adhere to our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), [Branded Content Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/bc-policy?lang=en) (if applicable), and all applicable laws and regulations.  
•  Have the [content disclosure setting](#3) turned on. If you don't display the proper disclosure, we may remove or restrict your posts.

###   
  
  
**What is the content disclosure setting?**

  
The content disclosure setting allows you to add a disclosure to your post to clearly indicate that your content is commercial in nature. This includes content that promotes a brand, product, or service, whether you're promoting your own business or posting branded content on behalf of a third party, such as a company.

###   
  
  
**What happens when you turn on the content disclosure setting?**

  
When you turn on the content disclosure setting, you'll be asked to indicate what type of content your post contains.  
•  If you're promoting your own brand or business, your post will be labeled as **Promotional content.**  
•  If you're posting branded content on behalf of another business, your post will be labeled as **Paid partnership.**  
  
Note: Turning on the content disclosure setting won't affect the distribution of your post in feeds on TikTok.

###   
  
  
**How to turn on the content disclosure setting**

  
You can turn on the content disclosure setting before or after you post your content and when you go LIVE. Keep in mind that once your post or LIVE is published, it will be labeled as **Paid partnership** or **Promotional content** and can't be changed. If you made a mistake in how you disclosed your content, you can remove your LIVE or post and create a new one with the correct selection.

When you post content that promotes a brand, product, or service, we recommend that you only use music from our [Commercial Music Library (CML)](https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/music/pc/en), as it's pre-cleared for commercial use. The licenses we hold for music outside of the CML don't cover the commercial use of music in content.  
  
If you decide to use an original sound or music from outside of our CML, you must agree to our Music Usage Confirmation when the [content disclosure setting](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/promoting-a-brand-product-or-service#5) is turned on. This confirms that there's no copyright-protected music in the post, or that you've obtained and paid for all necessary licenses to use the music.
