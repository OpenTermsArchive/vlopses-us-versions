#### TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms

**These terms apply with effect from: 29 July 2024** 

  

These terms (the **"TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms**") apply to Business Products Data that you share with us or enable us to access in connection with your use of any TikTok Business Products. 

  

These TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms apply to any Business Products Data that you share with us or enable us to access in connection with any TikTok pilots, tests, alpha or beta programs that you participate in from time to time. They apply whether you share Business Products Data with us directly (for example by implementing our Device Data Collection Tools) or indirectly (for example, when you authorize us to integrate with your data provider, measurement partner, or data management platform). When we process Contact Details for the purposes of our Custom Audiences (Customer File) Product, our Special Product Terms apply in the circumstances described in Clause 2.9 of these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms.  Lead Generation Products and Lead Generation Data (as defined in the [Lead Generation Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/lead-gen-terms)) are governed by the [Lead Generation Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/lead-gen-terms) and not these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms.

  

By clicking "**Accept**" or "**Agree**", or otherwise by using any of the TikTok Business Products, you agree (on your own behalf and on behalf of any person for whom you act) as follows:

**2       Requirements for sharing and enabling access to Business Products Data**  

  

2.1     When you use the TikTok Business Products you share with us, or enable us to access, Business Products Data. We process the Business Products Data for the purposes described in Clause 3 and in accordance with applicable data protection laws. The type(s) of Business Products Data that you share or enable us to access (whether Contact Details, Developer Data and/or Events Data) will depend on the specific TikTok Business Products you use. 

  

2.2     We will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the Business Products Data from and against a breach of security leading to its accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.  

2.3     If you share Contact Details with us, or otherwise enable us to access Contact Details using TikTok Business Products, for matching purposes, then those Contact Details will be hashed prior to transmission to us to protect individuals' privacy.  

  

2.4     TikTok will not provide audiences you create to other advertisers unless you or your service providers share audiences with other advertisers through the TikTok for Business Tools, subject to the restrictions and requirements of those tools and our terms. Further we will not share such audiences with third parties other than where we have your authorization to do so, where they are service providers to you or to us, or where we believe we are required to do so by law. You acknowledge that we may provide access to and/or a copy of Business Products Data to any individual who exercises their right of access in accordance with applicable data protection laws. 

  

2.5     You must only share with us or enable us to access Business Products Data in a manner that is transparent and lawful. You (and any agency or data provider that you may use) must therefore have provided all necessary transparency notices, and have all necessary rights, permissions and lawful bases (including consent, if and where required) required by applicable laws in order to share with us or enable us to access Business Products Data for use in accordance with Clause 3.   

  

2.6     If you receive any request, complaint or other correspondence relating to your use of the TikTok Business Products or the processing of any Business Products Data under these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms, you will promptly notify TikTok and provide all information, cooperation and assistance as TikTok reasonably requires in order to respond to such correspondence in accordance with any timescales that may apply under applicable law.

  

2.7     Subject to Clause 2.8, if you are using the TikTok Business Products, or sharing or enabling access to Business Products Data, on behalf of (or together with) a third party (e.g. if you are an agent or a data provider acting on behalf of an advertiser), you represent and warrant that you are duly authorized by such third party: 

(a)     to use the TikTok Business Products, and share or enable access to, Business Products Data, on that third party's behalf, and  

(b)     to enter these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms on behalf of such third party and bind it to these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms. You will only use or share the Business Products Data or any audiences or reports generated through use of the Business Products Data with or on behalf of such third party. 

  

2.8     You will not share with us or enable us to access Business Products Data that you know or ought reasonably to know is from or about Children or that includes health or financial information, or other categories of sensitive information (including any information defined as sensitive or special category data under applicable laws, regulations and applicable industry guidelines). For the purposes of this Clause, the term "**Children**" includes: 

(a)     any individual under the age of 13; and  

(b)     any individual who is under the age of majority in the territory in which they reside who is not permitted under applicable local laws to consent on their own behalf to processing of their Business Products Data (where consent is required for such processing under applicable local laws).  

  

2.9     Special Product Terms apply to TikTok's processing of Contact Details in connection with specific TikTok Business Products listed below, and these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms do not apply to the extent that TikTok's processing of Contact Details is subject to such Special Product Terms. For these purposes, Special Product Terms apply to processing of Contact Details in connection with: 

(a)     our Custom Audiences (Customer File) Product (where such processing of Contact Details shall instead be subject to the [Custom Audiences (Customer File) Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/custom-audience-terms)); and

(b)     any other TikTok advertising or social products with product-specific terms and conditions that apply to processing of Contact Details and which expressly exclude or take precedence over these Business Products (Data) Terms in respect of such processing.  

For the avoidance of doubt, any Event Data and/or Developer Data accessed in connection with Clauses 2.9 (a) and (b), remains subject to these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms.  

  

**3     How TikTok uses Business Products Data**  

  

3.1     Depending on the TikTok Business Products you use, we will use Business Products Data for the following purposes:

   |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Purpose name** | **Purpose description** | **Business Products Data used for this purpose** |
| (a) | **Collection and transmission of Developer Data and/or Event Data by (and to) TikTok** | The collection of Developer Data and/or Event Data and its transmission to TikTok for subsequent processing by TikTok in connection with any of purposes b to g below. | Developer Data and/or Event Data |
| (b) | **Measurement and Insight Reporting** | To produce and provide you with reports measuring the impact and performance of your ads and other content through the TikTok Business Products. <br><br>We will also use Event Data to produce benchmarking reports to share with other customers of TikTok Business Products, but such benchmarking reports will not identify you or any of your users. | Event Data |
| (c) | **Audience creation and Ad Targeting** | To target your ad campaigns to individuals on TikTok inventory. You may direct us to create targeted audiences using the TikTok Business Products, which are specific groups of individuals with characteristics you determine based on Event Data, to target ad campaigns (including via “Engagement Custom Audiences”, “App Activity Custom Audiences” and “Website Traffic Custom Audiences”).<br><br>You may not sell or transfer the audiences you create or authorize any third party to sell or transfer these audiences.<br><br>For the avoidance of doubt, these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms apply to the use of “Engagement Custom Audiences”, “App Activity Custom Audiences” and “Website Traffic Custom Audiences” created through TikTok's Business Products. The Custom Audiences (Customer File) Product is subject to the [Custom Audience (Customer File) Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/custom-audience-terms).  TikTok shall not process the audiences created when you use a TikTok Business Product for any purpose other than targeting your ad campaigns, unless and except as instructed by you. | Event Data |
| (d) | **Improving, Optimizing and Personalizing Ads and Other Content** | We may correlate Event Data to individuals who use our services to support the objectives of your campaigns, improve the effectiveness of our services and personalize the ads and other content displayed to individuals. <br><br>In connection with improving the effectiveness of our services, we will: (i) use your Event Data for delivery optimization only after combining such Event Data with other data collected from others or otherwise collected on our services; and (ii) not allow others to target campaigns solely on the basis of your Event Data. | Event Data |
| (e) | **Safety, Security, Fraud Prevention and Development** | To improve the user experience of our products and services, we may also use Developer Data and/or Event Data to promote and ensure the safety and security on and off our products and services, for research and development purposes and to maintain the integrity of and to improve our products and services. | Developer Data and/or Event Data |
| (f) | **Contact Details Matching** | Except where TikTok's processes Contact Details pursuant to Special Product Terms, TikTok will match Contact Details against corresponding accounts on TikTok inventory to create a subset of matched IDs ("**Matched IDs**") and combine those Matched IDs with corresponding Event Data in connection with the subsequent purposes listed in this Clause 3.1. For the avoidance of doubt, in the circumstances described above, the Matched IDs will only be processed in accordance with these TikTok Business Products (Data) Terms. | Contact Details |
| (g) | **Developer Tool Functionality** | TikTok will process Developer Data for the purpose of providing you with the functionality of the specific TikTok for Developer Tool(s) you integrate on your (or third party) apps and sites. | **Developer Data** |

1.1            These TikTok For Business Commercial Terms of Service (these “**Commercial Terms**”) govern your use of TikTok’s products and/or services, in connection with your TikTok For Business, TikTok Ads Manager or TikTok Business Center accounts (“**Commercial Products**”).

If you permit such access, you agree that TikTok may share access to your Commercial Account and assets, data, content or features within or available through it, as authorized by you. 

4.4           You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs in connection with your Commercial Account, including any activity of your Permitted Users, and any decisions you make to grant or revoke access rights to Permitted Users. TikTok shall not be liable for acts or omissions of your Permitted Users, their products or services, or how they use the permissions you have granted them. If you share or authorize the sharing of data with a Permitted User, you shall ensure that the Permitted User keeps such data confidential and secure, and that the data sharing complies with applicable laws, including by having contractual terms in place with Permitted Users to cover the data sharing between you, if the law requires this. 

4.5           If you are a Permitted User, you agree: (a) to access and use the Commercial Account of the Account Holder, and any assets, data, content or features made available through such Commercial Accounts, in a secure and confidential manner and solely for the purposes for which the Account Holder has granted you access, and in accordance with any permissions, terms or instructions from the Account Holder; (b) to keep all authorization tokens or credentials confidential and secure; and (c) not to share, or permit authorization tokens or credentials, to be shared with any third party. If your authorization expires or is revoked, you will immediately cease to access the Account Holder’s Commercial Account, and delete all assets, content or data received through such Commercial Accounts, unless expressly agreed otherwise with the Account Holder.

5               Your Access to and Use of Commercial Products 

5.1           You represent and warrant that your, and any of your Permitted Users’, activities in connection with these Commercial Terms, or access or use of the Commercial Products complies with all applicable laws, regulations and industry codes of practice, and does not infringe on the rights of any third parties.

5.2           If you use any application, software, software as a service, platform, dashboard, pixel, API, SDK, cookies, code, scripts, or other technology which is provided as part of a Commercial Product (“**TikTok Commercial Technology**”), you will not: 

(a)            to the greatest extent permitted under applicable law, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or create any derivative works based on the TikTok Commercial Technology, including any files, tables or documentation (or any portion thereof), or determine or attempt to determine any source code, algorithms, methods or techniques embodied in the TikTok Commercial Technology or any works derived from it;

5.4           You may use third-party measurement partners to track the effectiveness and performance of Commercial Products, provided that: (a) you work with third-party measurement partners that we have pre-approved or approved in writing; (b) you follow our written instructions regarding the use of such third-party measurement partners (for example, instructions given in our Business Help Center regarding configuration of tracking links); and (c) any TikTok Commercial Technology provided to enable the integration (for example, code) is not altered or modified without TikTok's express approval. Except as permitted in this Section, you will not use any tracking technologies to track or measure performance of Commercial Products or integrate any third-party cookies, pixels, images, beacons, code, tags, persistent identifiers, or other ad service/tracking technology with any TikTok Commercial Technology.

8               Confidentiality

8.1           Each party agrees to keep confidential the other party’s Confidential Information and to establish and maintain adequate security measures to safeguard the other party’s Confidential Information from unauthorized access or use. “**Confidential Information**” means all information of any kind which would be regarded as confidential by a reasonable business person, that has been disclosed by one party or its employees, officers, representatives, subcontractors, affiliates or advisers (“**Representatives**”) to the other party, or its Representative pursuant to these Commercial Terms whether before or after the date of these Commercial Terms, and any confidential information concerning the business, affairs, marketing and public relations plans, customers, clients or suppliers of the other party.

11.2        Without prejudice to Section 11.1, TikTok will notify you of any Indemnified Claims it seeks to recover, and at your expense reasonably cooperate with you in defending such Indemnified Claims. You may not settle any Indemnified Claim that imposes any obligation or liability on us without our express written consent. TikTok may (at its own cost) choose to participate in the defense and settlement of the Indemnified Claims.

12.1        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT HEREIN, THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND DISPLAY SITES ARE PROVIDED “AS AVAILABLE” AND “AS IS” AND TIKTOK MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO THEM. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT HEREIN, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TIKTOK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

13.2        TIKTOK AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY: (A) INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; OR (B) ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR INTANGIBLE LOSSES, EVEN IF TIKTOK HAS BEEN ADVISED OR SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

14            Governing Law; Dispute Resolution 

14.1        Governing Law

(a)            If you are based in the United States, the laws of the state of California will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.2(b)(i).

(b)            If you are based in the United Kingdom, EEA or Switzerland, the laws of England and Wales will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.3.

(c)            If you are based in the Republic of Indonesia, the laws of the Republic of Indonesia will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter.

(d)            If you are based outside of the United States, United Kingdom, EEA Switzerland, or the Republic of Indonesia, the laws of Singapore will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.5.

14.2        **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United States**

PLEASE REVIEW THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS YOU AND TIKTOK MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AGAINST EACH OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION (“**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”**).

(a)            Informal Resolution Process First 

If we have a dispute with you relating to or arising out of these Commercial Terms, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably. You agree to do the same for us.

The party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other in accordance with Section 15.9 of these Commercial Terms. The party receiving the notice will have 60 days to respond. If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings (or, to the extent permitted under this Arbitration Agreement, file court action) against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You and TikTok agree that you both will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you or TikTok files any legal action against the other, and that applicable statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process.

(b)            Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

(i)             Scope of Arbitration Agreement

The parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“**FAA**”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement. 

The parties agree that after completing the informal dispute resolution process in Section 14.2(a), any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or arising out of your access to or use of the Commercial Products under these Commercial Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Commercial Terms (“**Claims**”) will be resolved by binding individual arbitration, rather than by a court of law, except as otherwise provided below. If the parties’ dispute involves some arbitrable claims and some non-arbitrable claims, all non-arbitrable claims must be stayed until completion of the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Claims, including those that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, you and TikTok expressly agree not to initiate or participate in any existing or future class, collective or representative actions against the other, as set forth in Section 14.2(b)(vi).

Notwithstanding any other provision in these Commercial Terms, this Arbitration Agreement will not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (a) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction, (b) injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights, and (c) claims not subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law, after accounting for FAA preemption. Additionally, to the extent a Claim seeks public injunctive relief that is found to be a cognizable claim, such Claim must be resolved by a court or law, and stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration of any related Claims.

To the extent the parties are permitted under this Arbitration Agreement to have a matter or Claim resolved by a court of law rather than in arbitration, you and TikTok agree that such matters or Claims shall be litigated exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such disputes.

(ii)            Arbitration Rules and Forum

The arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“**NAM**”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, as discussed below) and the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, a party must satisfy the requirements pursuant to NAM’s rules. The most current version of the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the NAM Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures are available at [](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/)[https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/). If NAM is unable to arbitrate the dispute for whatever reason, a court of competent jurisdiction shall appoint the arbitrator.

The payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), except that (1) the prevailing party may seek attorneys’ fees, costs, and reimbursement of NAM filing and professional service fees if the arbitrator finds that the opposing party brought a claim, counterclaim, or defense that was either frivolous or brought with an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of arbitration; and (2) if a party timely serves an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (or its state law equivalent), and the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs, including filing fees, incurred after the offer was made.

(iii)           Mass Filing and Bellwether Protocols

To increase efficiency of resolution, and subject to a decision by NAM to invoke its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, the following protocol will apply if 100 or more similar arbitration demands are presented under these terms by or with the assistance of the same law firm or collection of law firms (“**Mass Filing**”). For the avoidance of doubt, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures shall apply if the parties’ dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to the NAM Rules and this Mutual Arbitration Provision, to be part of a Mass Filing.

Any Mass Filing shall be subject to bellwether protocols intended to reach a fair and speedy resolution of all claims included in the Mass Filing. In any Mass Filing, NAM shall randomly select four (4) demands for arbitration to proceed, and then claimants and respondents shall each select three (3) additional demands for arbitration to proceed -- for a total of ten (10) arbitrations (“**Bellwether Arbitrations**”). While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, all other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing shall be held in abeyance and stayed, and no party shall be responsible for paying any administrator or arbitrator fees (other than NAM’s initial filing/administrative fees, and Procedural Arbitrator fees, if applicable) while the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated. Any applicable statute of limitations regarding those demands shall remain tolled beginning when the Mass Filing claimant first provided the other party with notice of its intent to initiate informal dispute resolution, as discussed above.

The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within 120 days of its initial pre-hearing conference.

The parties agree that these bellwether proceeding protocols are designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including claims that are not selected for Bellwether Arbitration.

Following the resolution of all of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall engage in a global mediation of all remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing. The mediation shall be administered by NAM. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within 30 days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be administered by NAM pursuant to the provisions below regarding batching, along with NAM Rules and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

If the parties are unavailable to achieve global resolution following the above Bellwether Arbitrations and global mediation, these batching provisions shall apply and NAM shall (i) consolidate the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per batch; and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator assigned per batch. This batching process shall not impact the nature of these actions as individual in nature, including that the arbitrator will make a separate determination for each claimant, nor shall it change the burden of proof on each individual claimant. You and TikTok both agree to cooperate in good faith with each other and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach, including in working with NAM to request a different fee schedule from that set forth in NAM’s relevant rules and that is more favorable to You and TikTok. Any disagreement over the batch approach will be determined with all affected parties in a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator subject to the requirements of this Section and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

(iv)           Arbitrator Powers

The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that a court of law has the exclusive authority to determine the enforceability of any part of the Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions provision in Section 14.2(b)(vi) of this Arbitration Agreement. All disputes regarding allocation of the arbitrator’s fees and/or the arbitration fees shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and TikTok.

(v)            Waiver of Jury Trial

You and TikTok waive any rights to sue in court and receive a judge or jury trial, except as otherwise specified in this Arbitration Agreement.

(vi)           Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions

You and TikTok agree to waive any right to have Claims decided on a class, collective or representative basis, except as set forth in this Section 14.2(b)(vi) (“Class Action Waiver”). In any case in which (1) Claims are filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, and/or representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. This provision does not prevent you or TikTok from participating in a settlement on a class-wide, collective, or representative basis.

(vii)         Survival

This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with TikTok.

(viii)        Severability

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, then (i) the unenforceable or unlawful portion will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (ii) the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect, and (iii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portion will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, severance of any portion of the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.2(b)(vi) shall not be construed to permit you or TikTok to proceed with Claims in mass arbitration, to which the parties expressly do not consent.

(c)            ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD / LIMITATION ON LEGAL ACTION

YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE COMMERCIAL TERMS.  OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, BASED ON SUCH EVENTS OR FACTS, AND SUCH CLAIM(S) OR CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.

14.3        **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United Kingdom, EEA or Switzerland**

(a)            Class Action Waiver 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and TikTok acknowledge and agree that each is waiving the right to bring or participate in a class, collective, or consolidated proceeding against each other.

(b)            Exceptions to Mediation and Arbitration

Nothing in this Section 14.3 shall: (i) prevent TikTok from applying to any court or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction for interim relief of any kind including, without limitation, injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights; (ii) require either party to arbitrate claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law (and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such claims); or (iii) prevent either party from bringing a claim in a court of law where it has a legal right to do so without prior mediation and/or arbitration (as applicable) under applicable law, unless that legal right can be given up or changed by contractual agreement.

#### TIKTOK FOR BUSINESS ADVERTISING TERMS

Last Revised: September 2025  Previous Versions: [Here](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10021673).

  

1        Introduction

1.1           These TikTok For Business Advertising Terms (these “**Advertising Terms**”) govern your use of the Commercial Products (as defined in the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628)) to submit, create, or place advertising or any other type of sponsored or promotional content, or to plan or manage ad campaigns, which might include the use of creators or other third parties (“**Ad Services**”). 

1.2           If you are using Ad Services as an agent for another individual or entity, then you represent and warrant that: (a) you are authorized to, and do, bind that individual or entity to the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and these Advertising Terms; and (b) all of your  actions in connection with the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and these Advertising Terms are and will be within the scope of the agency relationship between you and that individual or entity, and in accordance with any applicable legal and fiduciary duties. 

1.3           These Advertising Terms form part of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628). They apply in addition to the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and any other applicable Supplemental Terms (as defined in the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628)). To the extent any specific provision of these Advertising Terms conflicts or is inconsistent with any term of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628), the specific provision of these Advertising Terms will prevail.

(a)            Capitalized terms not defined in these Advertising Terms shall have the meaning given to them under the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628). 

(b)            Your use of the Ad Services will constitute acceptance of these Advertising Terms.  

(c)            The TikTok entity you contract with under these Advertising Terms (“**Contracting Entity**”) is listed in the [Contracting Entities](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004970) and you agree that it may be a different entity from the TikTok entity you contract with under the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628). 

(d)            The Contracting Entity is: (i) responsible for providing any Ad Services you purchase, and (ii) the entity which you will be obligated to pay for such Ad Services. 

(e)            If you have any claim related to Ad Services, you agree that such claims will be made solely against the Contracting Entity. Any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Advertising Terms or their subject matter will be governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the Contracting Entity is formed or registered, and resolved in accordance with Sections 14.2 - 14.5 of the Commercial Terms, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TikTok has discretion to pursue payment disputes in the local courts of the jurisdiction where the Contracting Entity is formed or registered, or where you are formed or registered. Any other claims relating to the Commercial Products (that are not related to Ad Services) will be made against the TikTok entity you contract with under the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and resolved in accordance with Section 14 of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628).

2        Payment

2.1           If you are required to pay for any Ad Services, you also agree to the [Ad Services Payment Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004640).

3        Access and Use

3.1           You will ensure any of Your Content (as defined in the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628)) that is provided for Ad Services (“**Ad Content**”) will comply with the [Advertising Policies](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-advertising-policies?lang=en). 

3.2           TikTok does not allow paid political advertising, or paid advertising of any kind by political figures and entities. By using Ad Services, you declare that your Ad Content complies with the [](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture?aadvid=7264565310684938241)[Political Advertising Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture?aadvid=7264565310684938241).

3.3           You agree that you are solely responsible for your Ad Content, including: (a) targeting and trafficking decisions, such as keywords and other elements selected for targeting; (b) any legally required disclosures, landing pages and applications that users will be redirected to; (c) any promotions, sweepstakes, or contests that are offered in connection with ad campaigns; and (d) any production requirements or claims about your products or services, calls to action, or other promotional messages (collectively, “**Messaging**”). The foregoing applies even if TikTok provides services or tools to assist with creating, optimizing, targeting, or trafficking of your Ad Content, or reviews your Ad Content prior to placement.  

3.4           If your Ad Content contains musical works, compositions or sound recordings (collectively, the "**Music**") not sourced from TikTok’s Commercial Music Library, then you agree that you have obtained all rights, licenses and permissions as may be necessary for such Music to be incorporated within your Ad Content.

3.5           TikTok will decide, in its sole discretion, how to format, position, and size your Ad Content on Display Sites.  

3.6           TikTok has the right to reject, remove or require your Ad Content to be amended for any reason including if, in its sole discretion, TikTok reasonably considers your Ad Content to be unsuitable or in contravention of these Advertising Terms, [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628), or any other Supplemental Terms.  

3.7           TikTok may apply disclosures or disclaimers, such as for graphic or mature content, to your Ad Content, as may be required under applicable law or at TikTok’s sole discretion. 

3.8           TikTok makes no commitments regarding: (a) availability of Ad Services; (b) editorial adjacency, content adjacency or competitive separation; (c) reach, frequency, cadence, or performance of your ad campaigns; or (d) fraudulent, invalid or non-human activity and any impact it may have on your ad campaigns.   

3.9           In addition to the obligations set forth in these Advertising Terms, should TikTok provide you with support services related to Ad Services, such as managing an ad campaign on your behalf, in accordance with your instructions and booking details (“**Managed Services**”), you agree: (a) to adhere to any deliverables timelines as mutually agreed to by you and TikTok; (b) that you are responsible for any instructions, specifications, booking details, and/or approvals provided by you, including any changes you make to them; and (c) that, without prejudice to Section 13 of the Commercial Terms, TikTok shall not be liable (whether in contract, tort (including negligence), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise), for the Managed Services, to the extent TikTok has provided them in accordance with the instructions, specifications, and/or booking details, provided by you.

4        Use of Ad Content

4.1           Notwithstanding the license grant to TikTok under Section 6.2(d) of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628), TikTok will only use Ad Content: (a) to perform its obligations under these Advertising Terms, such as providing the Ad Services you have purchased; (b) to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations to which TikTok or its affiliates are subject, or to assist with a lawful investigation; (c) for testing and internal research and development purposes; (d) with your prior consent, for external marketing purposes or external research and development; and (e) to provide the transparency tools as described below.     

4.2           From time to time, TikTok may offer transparency tools to enable users to review, understand, and control their advertising experience on display sites. You agree that your Ad Content and associated information may be provided within such tools and that users’ choices may impact how they interact with your Ad Content or whether they see your Ad Content.    

5        Creator Services

5.1           You may choose to engage individuals, such as bloggers, influencers (directly or through third parties) or other content creators, such as creative agencies or production companies (collectively, “**Creators**”), to edit, create, produce and/or distribute Ad Content either: (a) independently of TikTok; or (b) through a program or initiative operated by TikTok in connection with its third party creative partners (a “**TikTok Creative Initiative**”). In each case, you remain solely responsible for any content and Messaging that you suggest, request, and/or require Creators to include, or that you otherwise approve to be included, in an ad campaign (“**Creator Content**"), which will form part of your Ad Content. Creators own their Creator Content unless negotiated separately between you and the relevant Creators. TikTok is an independent contractor and will not be deemed an agent of either Creators or you, nor will TikTok be liable for the acts or omissions of Creators.

5.2           If separate terms apply to a TikTok Creative Initiative (“**TikTok Creative Initiative Terms**”), to the extent any specific provision of this Section 5 conflicts or is inconsistent with any term of the TikTok Creative Initiative Terms, the TikTok Creative Initiative Terms will prevail to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
