Ad Serving Policy
=================

Last updated: October 2024

TikTok may, at its’ sole discretion, update this Ad Serving Policy from time to time. We will provide notice of any material changes to this Policy, and any changes to this Policy will not apply retroactively. If you do not agree to be bound by the changes, you shall immediately cease related advertising activities. You further agree that if you continue to use and/or access the services after being notified of such changes to the Policy, such use and/or access shall constitute acceptance of–and agreement to–such changes.

  

**Bidding Rules:**

1.  ​No matter what billing currency is applied for payments under the Agreement, bidding on the TikTok for Business Platform ("Platform") will be ranked by default in US Dollar while bidding on ByteDance China Ads platform (抖音) will be ranked by default in RMB. In the case of ByteDance Overseas AD platform, the conversion of non-US Dollar billing currency into US Dollar for the purpose of bidding will take place automatically pursuant to the real time exchange rate announced by the website designated by Media Company. For ByteDance China ADS platform, the conversion of non-RMB billing currency into RMB for the purpose of bidding will be made based on the exchange rate announced by the website designated by TikTok. The conversion rules shall be applied by TikTok.

If the difference is determined to be greater than +/-20%, then Advertiser/Agency and TikTok shall conduct a data review process together with the third-party data analytics company and correct the errors, if any. If the data review fails to identify any error (e.g. there is no data gap in Media Company’s records), TikTok’s data shall remain final and binding.

3.  ​If Advertiser/Agency would like to use certain assets (including, but not limited to popular IP, portraits, music, sticker images, etc.), it should provide the copyright certification of those assets or the authorization document and grant a license of use to TikTok in writing. TikTok will provide an authorization template upon request.
    

  

**Reservation Order Changes or Cancellation:**

1.  Reservation ads IO shall be based on the media plan confirmed by both Parties in writing, including through emails. Once the media plan is confirmed by both Parties, the order will be regarded as successfully placed. Cancellation of–or changes to–the order will require negotiation between both Parties. If Advertiser/Agency suggests canceling or changing the order unilaterally, it shall compensate TikTok for the loss according to relevant agreed terms.
    
2.  Unilateral Withdrawal by Advertiser/Agency

    2.  Advertiser/Agency shall pay 50% of the actual ad consumption amount to Media Company if any change is made to non-standard ad order earlier than 30 (included) to 14 calendar days before the scheduled ad flight date.

**Disclaimer**:

1.  ​If any ad fails to be served because Advertiser/Agency fails to deliver ad assets within the agreed timeline, TikTok will not be responsible in such situation and will not make any compensation to Advertiser/Agency. If the ad runs but fails to deliver due to late submission of assets by Advertiser/Agency, TikTok shall not be responsible for any compensation to the Advertiser/Agency. Failure to deliver ad assets within the agreed timeline shall constitute Unilateral Cancellation by Advertiser/Agency.
    
2.  ​All assets provided by Advertiser/Agency shall conform to the specifications and requirements as set forth in the “TikTok Advertising Policies – Ad Creatives & Landing Page” and the “Ad Specifications” policy.

4.  ​Third party tracking links are part of the creatives, and Advertiser/Agency should submit them to TikTok along with other campaign creatives. Late submission of third party tracking links can cause data discrepancy.
    
5.  ​TikTok shall not be responsible for any consequence if the landing page cannot work properly due to reason attributed to Advertiser/Agency. In such situation, Media Company may suspend the ad serving without informing Advertiser/Agency in advance in order to maintain the user experience. In addition, should TikTok become aware of any Advertiser/Agency inserting any universal link into the landing page, Media Company will immediately cease the ad serving without incurring any compensation to Advertiser/Agency.
    
6.  TikTok will not be responsible in any of the following events: relevant service is terminated/delayed/interrupted or any data loss due to Force Majeure event; any loss or damage caused by Advertiser/Agency employing illegal means to acquire data. Under those circumstances, no compensation will be made by TikTok.
    
7.  ​If a third-party institution claims compensation for damage based on advertising content, it shall be made clear that Advertiser/Agency is responsible, and the compensation to the third-party shall be made by Advertiser/Agency directly. This term will not apply when the damage is due to acts solely attributable to TikTok.
    
8.  ​For Topview and Takeover ads, the same creative can not be used for 2 consecutive days. For Topview ads, the same creative cannot be used in any other ad placement on TikTok on the same campaign date.

2.  ​Compensation Policy:
    
    1.  ​For all standard ad products, TikTok will compensate for media value at the quantity rate of 1:1 of the underdelivered portion.

    2.  ​For non-standard ad products, TikTok is unable to support any monitoring nor guarantee impressions. If an advertising event fails to go online properly or issues with ad products emerge after the ad goes online due to reasons on TikTok’s side, the compensation for impressions shall be conducted according to non-standard ad compensation policy. Please contact sales team for more details of the policy. In principle, TikTok will not use standard ads to compensate for non-standard ads.
        
    3.  ​Sponsorships, which are sold at a flat rate, do not guarantee impressions, and makegoods are not available.
        
    4.  ​For managed service orders, errors in delivery which occur due to acts solely attributable to Advertiser/Agency will not be eligible for compensation or makegoods by TikTok.
        
3.  ​Compensation Time: please contact the sales team.
    
    1.  ​TikTok will provide the media schedule available for compensation within 3 calendar days after the reservation takeover& in-feed ad serving end.
        
    2.  ​For reservation takeover/in-feed video ads, if the order lasts for many days, Media Company will conduct the compensation for impressions after all the ad serving work finishes completely.
        
    3.  ​For reservation takeover/in-feed video ads, if any special emergency happens (e.g. TikTok fails to monitor the impressions due to bugs of ad products), TikTok will conduct the compensation for impressions after the bugs or other problems are fixed.
        
    4.  ​For non-standard advertising cooperation, TikTok will provide options to compensate for impressions within 24 hours if any delivery error occurs.

2.1     When you use the TikTok Business Products you share with us, or enable us to access, Business Products Data. We process the Business Products Data for the purposes described in Clause 3 and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

For these purposes, Special Product Terms apply to processing of Contact Details in connection with: 

(a)     our Custom Audiences (Customer File) Product (where such processing of Contact Details shall instead be subject to the Custom Audiences (Customer File) Terms); and

1               Your Relationship with Us 

1.1            These TikTok For Business Commercial Terms of Service (these “**Commercial Terms**”) govern your use of TikTok’s products and/or services, in connection with your TikTok For Business, TikTok Ads Manager or TikTok Business Center accounts (“**Commercial Products**”). Commercial Products also include any other TikTok products and/or services, where you accept these Commercial Terms as a condition of access or use. These Commercial Terms form a legally binding contract between you and TikTok. 

1.2           For purposes of  these Commercial Terms only, and unless otherwise specified:

 “**TikTok**”, “**we**”, and “**us**” means either:

*   ▪​TikTok Inc. (US), if you are based in North America (excluding Mexico);

*   ▪​TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited (UK), if you are based in the United Kingdom;

*   ▪​TikTok Technology Limited (Ireland), if you are based in the EEA or Switzerland; or

*   ▪​TikTok Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), if you are based in any other geographic area.

“**You**” or “**your**” means the entity or individual using the Commercial Products for its business or commercial purposes. 

1.3           Your use of the Commercial Products will constitute acceptance of these Commercial Terms. 

1.4           You must not use the Commercial Products unless you have full power and authority to enter into, and perform the obligations under, these Commercial Terms.

(c)            If you are based in the Republic of Indonesia, the laws of the Republic of Indonesia will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter.

(d)            If you are based outside of the United States, United Kingdom, EEA Switzerland, or the Republic of Indonesia, the laws of Singapore will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.5.

14.2        **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United States**

PLEASE REVIEW THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS YOU AND TIKTOK MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AGAINST EACH OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION (“**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”**).

(a)            Informal Resolution Process First 

If we have a dispute with you relating to or arising out of these Commercial Terms, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably. You agree to do the same for us.

The party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other in accordance with Section 15.9 of these Commercial Terms. The party receiving the notice will have 60 days to respond. If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings (or, to the extent permitted under this Arbitration Agreement, file court action) against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You and TikTok agree that you both will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you or TikTok files any legal action against the other, and that applicable statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process.

(b)            Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

(i)             Scope of Arbitration Agreement

The parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“**FAA**”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement. 

The parties agree that after completing the informal dispute resolution process in Section 14.2(a), any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or arising out of your access to or use of the Commercial Products under these Commercial Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Commercial Terms (“**Claims**”) will be resolved by binding individual arbitration, rather than by a court of law, except as otherwise provided below. If the parties’ dispute involves some arbitrable claims and some non-arbitrable claims, all non-arbitrable claims must be stayed until completion of the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Claims, including those that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, you and TikTok expressly agree not to initiate or participate in any existing or future class, collective or representative actions against the other, as set forth in Section 14.2(b)(vi).

Notwithstanding any other provision in these Commercial Terms, this Arbitration Agreement will not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (a) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction, (b) injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights, and (c) claims not subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law, after accounting for FAA preemption. Additionally, to the extent a Claim seeks public injunctive relief that is found to be a cognizable claim, such Claim must be resolved by a court or law, and stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration of any related Claims.

To the extent the parties are permitted under this Arbitration Agreement to have a matter or Claim resolved by a court of law rather than in arbitration, you and TikTok agree that such matters or Claims shall be litigated exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such disputes.

(ii)            Arbitration Rules and Forum

The arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“**NAM**”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, as discussed below) and the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, a party must satisfy the requirements pursuant to NAM’s rules. The most current version of the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the NAM Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures are available at [](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/)[https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/). If NAM is unable to arbitrate the dispute for whatever reason, a court of competent jurisdiction shall appoint the arbitrator.

The payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), except that (1) the prevailing party may seek attorneys’ fees, costs, and reimbursement of NAM filing and professional service fees if the arbitrator finds that the opposing party brought a claim, counterclaim, or defense that was either frivolous or brought with an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of arbitration; and (2) if a party timely serves an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (or its state law equivalent), and the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs, including filing fees, incurred after the offer was made.

(iii)           Mass Filing and Bellwether Protocols

To increase efficiency of resolution, and subject to a decision by NAM to invoke its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, the following protocol will apply if 100 or more similar arbitration demands are presented under these terms by or with the assistance of the same law firm or collection of law firms (“**Mass Filing**”). For the avoidance of doubt, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures shall apply if the parties’ dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to the NAM Rules and this Mutual Arbitration Provision, to be part of a Mass Filing.

Any Mass Filing shall be subject to bellwether protocols intended to reach a fair and speedy resolution of all claims included in the Mass Filing. In any Mass Filing, NAM shall randomly select four (4) demands for arbitration to proceed, and then claimants and respondents shall each select three (3) additional demands for arbitration to proceed -- for a total of ten (10) arbitrations (“**Bellwether Arbitrations**”). While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, all other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing shall be held in abeyance and stayed, and no party shall be responsible for paying any administrator or arbitrator fees (other than NAM’s initial filing/administrative fees, and Procedural Arbitrator fees, if applicable) while the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated. Any applicable statute of limitations regarding those demands shall remain tolled beginning when the Mass Filing claimant first provided the other party with notice of its intent to initiate informal dispute resolution, as discussed above.

The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within 120 days of its initial pre-hearing conference.

The parties agree that these bellwether proceeding protocols are designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including claims that are not selected for Bellwether Arbitration.

Following the resolution of all of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall engage in a global mediation of all remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing. The mediation shall be administered by NAM. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within 30 days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be administered by NAM pursuant to the provisions below regarding batching, along with NAM Rules and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

If the parties are unavailable to achieve global resolution following the above Bellwether Arbitrations and global mediation, these batching provisions shall apply and NAM shall (i) consolidate the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per batch; and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator assigned per batch. This batching process shall not impact the nature of these actions as individual in nature, including that the arbitrator will make a separate determination for each claimant, nor shall it change the burden of proof on each individual claimant. You and TikTok both agree to cooperate in good faith with each other and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach, including in working with NAM to request a different fee schedule from that set forth in NAM’s relevant rules and that is more favorable to You and TikTok. Any disagreement over the batch approach will be determined with all affected parties in a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator subject to the requirements of this Section and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.

(iv)           Arbitrator Powers

The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that a court of law has the exclusive authority to determine the enforceability of any part of the Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions provision in Section 14.2(b)(vi) of this Arbitration Agreement. All disputes regarding allocation of the arbitrator’s fees and/or the arbitration fees shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and TikTok.

(v)            Waiver of Jury Trial

You and TikTok waive any rights to sue in court and receive a judge or jury trial, except as otherwise specified in this Arbitration Agreement.

(vi)           Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions

You and TikTok agree to waive any right to have Claims decided on a class, collective or representative basis, except as set forth in this Section 14.2(b)(vi) (“Class Action Waiver”). In any case in which (1) Claims are filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, and/or representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. This provision does not prevent you or TikTok from participating in a settlement on a class-wide, collective, or representative basis.

(vii)         Survival

This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with TikTok.

(viii)        Severability

If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, then (i) the unenforceable or unlawful portion will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (ii) the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect, and (iii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portion will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, severance of any portion of the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.2(b)(vi) shall not be construed to permit you or TikTok to proceed with Claims in mass arbitration, to which the parties expressly do not consent.

(c)            ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD / LIMITATION ON LEGAL ACTION

YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE COMMERCIAL TERMS.  OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, BASED ON SUCH EVENTS OR FACTS, AND SUCH CLAIM(S) OR CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.

14.3        **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United Kingdom, EEA or Switzerland**

(a)            Class Action Waiver 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and TikTok acknowledge and agree that each is waiving the right to bring or participate in a class, collective, or consolidated proceeding against each other.

(b)            Exceptions to Mediation and Arbitration

Nothing in this Section 14.3 shall: (i) prevent TikTok from applying to any court or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction for interim relief of any kind including, without limitation, injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights; (ii) require either party to arbitrate claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law (and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such claims); or (iii) prevent either party from bringing a claim in a court of law where it has a legal right to do so without prior mediation and/or arbitration (as applicable) under applicable law, unless that legal right can be given up or changed by contractual agreement.

(c)            Procedure

Subject to the exceptions in Section 14.3(b), if you have any claim or dispute against TikTok arising out of or in connection with these Commercial Terms, including any question regarding its existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity, the parties shall follow the procedure set out in this Section 14.3(c): 

(i)             Either party shall give to the other party written notice of the dispute, setting out its nature and full particulars, together with relevant supporting documents, and the parties shall agree to attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve such dispute by way of confidential discussions between the parties. The notice of dispute to TikTok must be sent to Kaleidoscope, 4 Lindsey Street, London, United Kingdom, EC1A 9HP, Attn: Legal Department and will be deemed to have been received upon delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, this notice provision applies notwithstanding the general notice provisions in Section 15.9.

(ii)            If the dispute has not been settled within 30 days of the date the written notice issued pursuant to Section 14.3(c)(i) was deemed received, or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, then the parties will refer the dispute to mediation under the International Chamber of Commerce (“**ICC**”) Mediation Rules or the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“**CEDR**”) Model Mediation Procedure (as chosen by you). Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of referral of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by the ICC or CEDR (as applicable). 

(iii)           If the dispute has not been settled within 60 days following the filing of a request for mediation or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, such dispute will thereafter be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC, which are incorporated by reference into this Section. 

(iv)           Unless the parties agree otherwise, there will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the ICC), the arbitration will take place in London, England, and the arbitration will be conducted in English.

The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of BANI for the time being in force ("**Rules**"), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Section except where such Rules conflict with the provisions of this Section, in which event the provisions of this Section shall prevail. The number of arbitrators will be one. The seat and venue of arbitration shall be Jakarta. The language of arbitration shall be English.

(c)            You and TikTok shall request the arbitrator to include in his/her award an authorization to the party in whose favor the award is issued to register at the relevant District Court in Indonesia in accordance with Law No. 30 of 1999 on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution ("**Arbitration Law**").

(d)            You and TikTok agree that the BANI arbitration award is final, binding and cannot be disputed by you or TikTok. You and TikTok hereby waive, to the fullest extent possible, any right to appeal or challenge any arbitral award, as well as any immunity or privilege that you or TikTok may have in relation to the validity or enforceability of an arbitral award or any decision relating to the same.

#### TIKTOK FOR BUSINESS ADVERTISING TERMS

Last Revised: September 2025  Previous Versions: [Here](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10021673).

  

1        Introduction

1.1           These TikTok For Business Advertising Terms (these “**Advertising Terms**”) govern your use of the Commercial Products (as defined in the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628)) to submit, create, or place advertising or any other type of sponsored or promotional content, or to plan or manage ad campaigns, which might include the use of creators or other third parties (“**Ad Services**”). 

1.2           If you are using Ad Services as an agent for another individual or entity, then you represent and warrant that: (a) you are authorized to, and do, bind that individual or entity to the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and these Advertising Terms; and (b) all of your  actions in connection with the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and these Advertising Terms are and will be within the scope of the agency relationship between you and that individual or entity, and in accordance with any applicable legal and fiduciary duties. 

1.3           These Advertising Terms form part of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628). They apply in addition to the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and any other applicable Supplemental Terms (as defined in the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628)). To the extent any specific provision of these Advertising Terms conflicts or is inconsistent with any term of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628), the specific provision of these Advertising Terms will prevail.

(a)            Capitalized terms not defined in these Advertising Terms shall have the meaning given to them under the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628). 

(b)            Your use of the Ad Services will constitute acceptance of these Advertising Terms.  

(c)            The TikTok entity you contract with under these Advertising Terms (“**Contracting Entity**”) is listed in the [Contracting Entities](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004970) and you agree that it may be a different entity from the TikTok entity you contract with under the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628). 

(d)            The Contracting Entity is: (i) responsible for providing any Ad Services you purchase, and (ii) the entity which you will be obligated to pay for such Ad Services. 

(e)            If you have any claim related to Ad Services, you agree that such claims will be made solely against the Contracting Entity. Any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Advertising Terms or their subject matter will be governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the Contracting Entity is formed or registered, and resolved in accordance with Sections 14.2 - 14.5 of the Commercial Terms, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TikTok has discretion to pursue payment disputes in the local courts of the jurisdiction where the Contracting Entity is formed or registered, or where you are formed or registered. Any other claims relating to the Commercial Products (that are not related to Ad Services) will be made against the TikTok entity you contract with under the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628) and resolved in accordance with Section 14 of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628).

2        Payment

3.2           TikTok does not allow paid political advertising, or paid advertising of any kind by political figures and entities. By using Ad Services, you declare that your Ad Content complies with the [](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture?aadvid=7264565310684938241)[Political Advertising Policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-politics-religion-and-culture?aadvid=7264565310684938241).

The foregoing applies even if TikTok provides services or tools to assist with creating, optimizing, targeting, or trafficking of your Ad Content, or reviews your Ad Content prior to placement.  

3.4           If your Ad Content contains musical works, compositions or sound recordings (collectively, the "**Music**") not sourced from TikTok’s Commercial Music Library, then you agree that you have obtained all rights, licenses and permissions as may be necessary for such Music to be incorporated within your Ad Content.

3.5           TikTok will decide, in its sole discretion, how to format, position, and size your Ad Content on Display Sites.

3.7           TikTok may apply disclosures or disclaimers, such as for graphic or mature content, to your Ad Content, as may be required under applicable law or at TikTok’s sole discretion. 

3.8           TikTok makes no commitments regarding: (a) availability of Ad Services; (b) editorial adjacency, content adjacency or competitive separation; (c) reach, frequency, cadence, or performance of your ad campaigns; or (d) fraudulent, invalid or non-human activity and any impact it may have on your ad campaigns.   

3.9           In addition to the obligations set forth in these Advertising Terms, should TikTok provide you with support services related to Ad Services, such as managing an ad campaign on your behalf, in accordance with your instructions and booking details (“**Managed Services**”), you agree: (a) to adhere to any deliverables timelines as mutually agreed to by you and TikTok; (b) that you are responsible for any instructions, specifications, booking details, and/or approvals provided by you, including any changes you make to them; and (c) that, without prejudice to Section 13 of the Commercial Terms, TikTok shall not be liable (whether in contract, tort (including negligence), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise), for the Managed Services, to the extent TikTok has provided them in accordance with the instructions, specifications, and/or booking details, provided by you.

4        Use of Ad Content

4.1           Notwithstanding the license grant to TikTok under Section 6.2(d) of the [Commercial Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004628), TikTok will only use Ad Content: (a) to perform its obligations under these Advertising Terms, such as providing the Ad Services you have purchased; (b) to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations to which TikTok or its affiliates are subject, or to assist with a lawful investigation; (c) for testing and internal research and development purposes; (d) with your prior consent, for external marketing purposes or external research and development; and (e) to provide the transparency tools as described below.     

4.2           From time to time, TikTok may offer transparency tools to enable users to review, understand, and control their advertising experience on display sites. You agree that your Ad Content and associated information may be provided within such tools and that users’ choices may impact how they interact with your Ad Content or whether they see your Ad Content.    

5        Creator Services

5.1           You may choose to engage individuals, such as bloggers, influencers (directly or through third parties) or other content creators, such as creative agencies or production companies (collectively, “**Creators**”), to edit, create, produce and/or distribute Ad Content either: (a) independently of TikTok; or (b) through a program or initiative operated by TikTok in connection with its third party creative partners (a “**TikTok Creative Initiative**”). In each case, you remain solely responsible for any content and Messaging that you suggest, request, and/or require Creators to include, or that you otherwise approve to be included, in an ad campaign (“**Creator Content**"), which will form part of your Ad Content. Creators own their Creator Content unless negotiated separately between you and the relevant Creators. TikTok is an independent contractor and will not be deemed an agent of either Creators or you, nor will TikTok be liable for the acts or omissions of Creators.

5.2           If separate terms apply to a TikTok Creative Initiative (“**TikTok Creative Initiative Terms**”), to the extent any specific provision of this Section 5 conflicts or is inconsistent with any term of the TikTok Creative Initiative Terms, the TikTok Creative Initiative Terms will prevail to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
