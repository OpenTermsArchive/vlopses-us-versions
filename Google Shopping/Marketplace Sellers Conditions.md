Shopping ads policies
=====================

As part of our recent suspension of ads in Russia, we will also pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia.

Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google ads from serving to users located in Russia.

Welcome to the Shopping ads Policy Center
-----------------------------------------

### Overview of our Shopping ads policies and how we enforce them

We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem – one that’s trustworthy and transparent, and works for customers, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this Policy Center is to help you build Shopping ads and local inventory ads campaigns that align with both our [ads policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942) and the Shopping ads policies listed below.

These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our customers and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to customers and the overall advertising ecosystem.

Our Shopping ads policies cover four broad areas:

**[Prohibited content](#con):** Content you're not allowed to list on the Google Network

**[Prohibited practices](#pra):** Things you can't do if you want to list products with us

**[Restricted content](#res):** Content you can list, but with limitations

**[Site requirements](#site):** Standards for your ads and website

Click through the policies below for policy definitions, examples, and troubleshooting steps.

We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that Shopping ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our customers and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts.

We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating Shopping ads so they don’t serve, temporarily capping ad impressions for some accounts flagged by Google AI, and suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations.

We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your Shopping ads is disapproved, [you can fix that shopping ad or appeal the decision](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6109185). You can also [appeal an account suspension decision](https://ads.google.com/nav/selectaccount?authuser=0&dst=/aw/overview?supportResource%3Dsuspension_help) (for this link to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account).

### Prohibited content

#### [Counterfeit goods](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149993)

> Google prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit products. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or logo of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.  
>   
> This policy applies to the content of your Shopping ads and your website.

#### [Dangerous products](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150004)

> Google wants to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don’t allow the promotion of some products that cause damage, harm, or injury.
> 
> _Examples of dangerous content:_ Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products.

#### [Products that enable dishonest behavior](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150005)

> Google values honesty and fairness, so we don’t allow the promotion of products that are designed to enable dishonest behavior.
> 
> _Examples of products that enable dishonest behavior:_ Hacking software or instructions; fake documents; academic cheating products.

#### [Inappropriate content](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6149990)

> Google values diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users, so we don’t allow ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence.
> 
> _Examples of inappropriate or offensive content:_ Bullying or intimidation of an individual or group; racial discrimination; hate group paraphernalia; graphic crime scene or accident images; cruelty to animals; murder; self-harm; extortion or blackmail; sale or trade of endangered species.

#### [Unsupported Shopping ads content](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150006)

> Google aims to enable businesses to promote a wide variety of products, but some Google products and platforms may not be optimized to appropriately support all content types.
> 
> For this reason, Shopping ads and free product listings don't allow the promotion of certain content where we don't offer an optimal user experience.
> 
> Note that because these limitations are specific to Shopping ads and free listings, they do not impact policies on other Google products or platforms, where functionality differs or additional support mechanisms are in place.

### Prohibited practices

#### [Abuse of the ad network](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150118)

Merchants need to reference trademarks to be able to communicate to users what they're offering, and users need that information as it's relevant to their searches. We’ll review claims by trademark owners that use of their trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion about the origin of a product. To submit a trademark-related complaint if you’re an owner of the trademark, use the [Report a legal issue in Shopping ads](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/TM_CF_Shopping?product=productsearch) form.

Specifically, Shopping ads that contain HFSS foods and beverages are now prohibited from targeting minors.
> 
> The information reflected in this policy is not intended to be legal advice and we expect all merchants and partners to comply with the local laws for any region their ads target, including local requirements that may differ from this HFSS Food & Beverage policy.

### Site requirements

We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer.

#### [Editorial & professional requirements](https://support.google.com/merchants/merchants/answer/6150244)

Trademarks
==========

This policy applies to free listings. Learn more about [Shopping ads policies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970).

Our policy
----------

Google doesn’t restrict use of trademarks by retailers in the title or description of a free listing when it’s for a trademarked product or a product compatible with the trademarked product. Retailers need to reference trademarks to be able to communicate to customers what they're offering, and customers need that information as it's relevant to their searches. We’ll review claims by trademark owners that use of their trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion about the origin of a product. To submit a trademark-related complaint if you’re an owner of the trademark, use this [form](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/TM_CF_Shopping?product=productsearch).

What you can do
---------------

Here's what you can do if your product is disapproved or if your Merchant Center account is impacted:

Product disapproval

Products that don't comply with our policies may be disapproved and won't be eligible to serve.

1.  **Read our Shopping [policies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970) to learn what we don't allow.**
2.  **Update your website.** If your ad or listing directs to violating content, update your website to meet all policy requirements.
    *   **Remove the violating products.** You must remove non-compliant offers from your product data feed. You’ll receive an email with details about the violations.
    *   **Update your product data in Merchant Center.** Manually update your product data or wait for your automated upload schedule to run before requesting any reviews.
3.  **Request a review or appeal.** After fixing the issue or if you believe the disapproval is incorrect, you can [request a review or appeal the decision](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/13585221).
    *   **Individual product review (if you fixed the issue)**
        *   If you edit your product data via your chosen upload method (such as a file) or directly in Merchant Center, the affected products will be automatically re-reviewed.
        *   If you remove the violating products from your feed, no further action or review request is necessary.
    *   **Standard appeal (if you disagree with the issue)**
        *   For certain issues, you can dispute the violation. You may need to complete additional steps, such as providing an appeal reason and/or uploading required documentation.
        *   If a review or appeal is successful, the issue will be removed from Merchant Center.
    *   **Bulk appeal (available in certain cases)**
        *   For specific policy issues where you believe a large number of offers require review, you may be able to submit a single bulk appeal.
        *   ⚠️ Warning: Before submitting a bulk appeal, **you must review your offers** and **remove any policy-violating items from your feed**.

Examples of what's allowed in some circumstances
------------------------------------------------

Here are some of the kinds of content that we restrict under this policy:

Prescription and behind-the-counter drugs

To ensure a safe and positive experience for customers, Google requires that retailers and market participants comply with all applicable laws and regulations in addition to [our policies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12073010). It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the place where your business operates, as well as for any other places your listings are shown. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing. In cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may ban you from listing content with us.

Abuse of the free listings network
==================================

This policy applies to free listings. Learn more about [Shopping ads policies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970).

Our policy
----------

Google wants free listings to be useful, varied, relevant and safe for customers, so we don’t allow any of the following:

*   Malicious content
*   Sites that offer little unique value to customers and are focused on traffic generation
*   Retailers who try to gain an unfair advantage in ranking
*   Retailers who try to bypass our review processes

All of our policies are crafted to protect a high quality user experience, and we have enforcement systems and processes to stop content that falls below these standards from being shown to customers. We take any attempts to trick or circumvent our review processes very seriously, so play fair.

Examples of what's not allowed
------------------------------

Malicious software

> “Malware” is software that aims to harm or get unapproved access to a computer, device, or network.
> 
> These requirements apply to your listings and any software that your site or app either hosts or links to, regardless of whether the software is promoted through the Google network. The following is not allowed:

> Intentional distribution of malicious software or "malware" that may harm or gain unauthorized access to a computer, device, or network

> _Examples (non-exhaustive):_

> *   Computer viruses, ransomware, worms, trojan horses, rootkits, keyloggers, dialers, spyware, rogue security software, and other malicious programs or apps
> *   Forced redirects, e.g. redirecting customers to an unknown site infected with malicious software without the customer actually clicking on the listing
> *   HTML5 ad stealing user credentials from a publisher’s page

Compromised sites

> A compromised site refers to a site or destination whose code has been manipulated to act in ways that benefit a third party without the knowledge of the site or destination’s owner or operator, and often in a way that harms the site’s users. The following scenarios would lead to disapproval for Compromised Site:

> Destinations which are hijacked and hacked

> _Examples (non-exhaustive)_:

> *   Sites injecting scripts or code that transmits customer data without consent, e.g. a credit card skimmer, installing malware on end user devices, launching pop-up ads, redirecting customers to other websites, and doing things with customer data without the end user’s consent; operating a website using a content management system with known security vulnerabilities, where it has been exploited.

Unwanted software

> Any software that your site or app hosts (or links to) should provide a positive experience for customers. Google’s [Unwanted Software policy](https://www.google.com/about/unwanted-software-policy.html) addresses characteristics of software that are potentially harmful to the customer experience.
> 
> The following scenarios would lead to disapproval for Unwanted Software:

> There is no clear description of the product in your listing or a landing page

> _Examples (non-exhaustive)_:

> *   No information about the product type (app, extension, software) in the listing or landing page; failure to be transparent about the functionality that the software provides; description of the functionality of the software differs from the actual functionality.
> 
> Failing to disclose the full implications of installing the software to the user
> 
> _Examples (non-exhaustive)_:
> 
> *   Making system changes or changes to the browser settings without the user’s consent and knowledge; making it difficult for users to disable or uninstall the software; failing to include Terms of Service or an End User License Agreement; bundling software or applications without the user’s knowledge; transmitting private information without the user’s knowledge

Low-value content

> Products that are designed for the primary purpose of showing ads or promotional content
> 
> *   _Examples_: Driving traffic (through “[arbitrage](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6020954)” or otherwise) to destinations with more ads than original content, little or no original content, or excessive advertising

> Sites that don't give all customers a way to complete the purchase of a product
> 
> *   _Examples_: Sites that allow purchase only by businesses, sites that allow purchase only by a certain subset of customers. [Learn more about business-to-business advertising](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6323982)

> Content that's replicated from another source without adding value such as original content or more functionality
> 
> *   _Examples_: Mirroring, framing, or scraping content from another source

> Landing pages that are solely designed to send customers elsewhere
> 
> *   _Examples_: Bridge, gateway, or [doorway pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#doorways)

Gaining an unfair advantage

> Using the Google network to gain an unfair traffic advantage in Shopping campaigns
> 
> *   _Examples_: Clicks or impressions generated by a market participant clicking their own listings, automated clicking tools or traffic sources, robots, or other deceptive software; duplicate listings

Gaming the Google network

> Engaging in practices that attempt to circumvent or interfere with Google’s systems and processes
> 
> *   _Examples_: Cloaking; use of dynamic DNS to switch page or product; manipulating product data or site content in order to bypass our automated system checks; restricting crawler access to your landing pages. [Learn more about Google search essentials](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials)

Linked account suspension

> Having a suspended account linked to your Merchant Center account

Misrepresentation
=================

This policy applies to free listings. Learn more about [Shopping ads policies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970).

Our policy
----------

Google doesn't want customers to feel misled by the content in your offers, and that means being upfront, honest, and providing them with the information that they need to make informed decisions. For this reason we don’t allow the following:

*   Offers that prompt customers to initiate a purchase, download, make another commitment without first providing all relevant information and getting the customer’s explicit consent
*   Offers that represent you or your products in a way that's not accurate, realistic, and truthful

Learn more about [Building trust with your customers](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/13693865).

Violations of this policy are taken very seriously and are considered egregious. An egregious violation of Shopping policies is a violation so serious that it’s unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether a merchant or destination is violating this policy, Google may review information from multiple sources including your listing, website, accounts, and third-party sources. If violations of this policy are found, your Google accounts will be suspended upon detection and without prior warning, and you won’t be allowed to list with Google Shopping again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, [submit an appeal](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/13585221) and explain why. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, and when there’s good reason so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more [about suspended accounts](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/13693195).

*   Adverse regulatory warnings
*   Settlements or rulings about your business practices
*   Direct complaints from businesses and other entities about impersonation

We take violations of this policy very seriously and consider them egregious. An egregious violation of our [policies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12073010) is a violation so serious that it's unlawful or poses significant harm to our customers.

In determining whether a market participant or destination is violating this policy, we may:

*   Review information from multiple sources including your product, website, accounts, and third-party sources.
*   If we find violations of this policy, we'll suspend your account upon detection and without prior warning, and you won't be allowed to participate in listing content with us again. We may also restrict your Merchant Center account's product limit.

If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy:

*   You can submit an appeal and explain why using the [link](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/13585221) at the bottom of this page.
*   We only reinstate accounts in compelling circumstances, and when there's good reason, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest.

* * *

Why this isn’t allowed
----------------------

*   **It’s harmful to people**: They can be exposed to scams, misleading information, or even dangerous products or services.
*   **It damages the overall shopping ecosystem**: When people have bad experiences, they become less likely to trust any listings, which hurts all advertisers. Google shopping wants to maintain a safe and healthy shopping ecosystem for everyone.

* * *

Best practices (non-exhaustive)
-------------------------------

Review this non-exhaustive list of best practices to help ensure that your listings comply with this policy.

*   **Deliver what customers paid for**: Provide the products or services customers purchased, meeting agreed-upon specifications.
*   **Describe your business on your website**: Make sure your website has updated contact information and a clear explanation of what your company does, like on an "About us" page.
*   **Use your own branding**: Use your own name, logo, images, and colors on your website and in your ads.
*   **Avoid using another brand’s identity in a misleading way**: Avoid using another brand’s name, logo, images, and colors in ways that can trick people. Don’t misspell another brand’s name in your ad text, like “G00gle”. When referencing another brand, follow Google’s policy on [trademarks](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12078092).
*   **Be clear about your partnerships**: If you're an official or authorized partner of another brand, ask them to mention you on their website in addition to making your relationship clear on your own website and ads. If you reference another brand but you're not an official or authorized partner, consider a disclaimer on your website and in your listings.
*   **Be qualified to do the work you advertise**: Have all necessary certifications to provide your products and services. If you list any certifications on your website, make sure they’re up to date.

* * *

Tips for submitting your appeal
-------------------------------

*   **Follow best practices**: Implement the best practices you've been provided if you haven’t already.
*   **Explain your situation**: If you're an official partner of another brand, describe your partnership and share any information that shows how you're connected.
*   **Share proof**: This can include contracts, written agreements, a link to a credible news article that mentions about the connection and any public statements (like a social media post) from the brand or organization confirming the partnership.
*   **Complete verification**: If asked, complete all [tasks required for advertiser verification](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/15577076).

This article outlines the additional requirements your products must meet to serve as a Demand Gen product ad.

Demand Gen and Shopping campaigns combine audience targeting features and visually engaging formats to help you better personalize your ads within Google's feeds to inspire customer action.

Promotions policies
===================

Promotions policies provide important guidance about promotion eligibility. To help make sure users have a positive experience, your promotions must comply with the following policies:

1.  [Promotions must add value](#add_value)
2.  [Adhere to Shopping ads policies](#ShoppingPolicies)
3.  [Adhere to Google editorial requirements for titles](#EditorialRequirements)
4.  [Follow redemption requirements](#redemption)
5.  [Avoid overly restrictive promotions](#restrictive)
6.  [Make promoted products clear to the shopper](#clear)
7.  [Make confirmation of promotion receipt clear](#confirmation)
8.  [Include redemption code for shipping promotions](#shipping)
9.  [Follow local promotions policies](#follow_local_promotions_policies)
10.  [Follow combined promotions policies](#combinedpromotion)

* * *

Promotions must add value
-------------------------

Promotions must provide a monetary discount or an additional good or service not normally associated with the purchase. All promotions are applied at checkout or point of sale.

Discount percentages must be whole numbers, decimals are not allowed.

Promotions **can't** be:

*   Trade-in offers
*   Mail-in or email rebates
*   Products and services that are usually free
*   Sweepstakes
*   Text used to advertise a product without a discount
*   Less than 5% off the current price of an item or $5 USD in the US, C$5 CAD in Canada, £5 GBP in the UK, R$5 BRL in Brazil, ₹5 INR in India, ¥5 JPY in Japan, ₩5 KRW in South Korea, A$5 AUD in Australia, €5 EUR in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain
*   Equal to or more than the cart value (100% or higher discounts)
*   Tax or value added tax (VAT) discounts
*   Reflected in the SKU (stock keeping unit) price on the Google product page or your product landing page

**Note**: Promotions are limited to 6 months or 183 days.

* * *

Adhere to Shopping ads policies
-------------------------------

Some products or services can't be shown in ads or free listings. For details, read the [Shopping ads policy restrictions](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970). Google reserves the right to remove any promotion from your ad or listing at any time for any reason.

* * *

Adhere to editorial requirements for titles
-------------------------------------------

Promotion titles should be concise, easy to understand, accurate, and only represent the value of the specific deal being promoted.

Titles need to:

*   Clearly state any minimum thresholds or items needed for deal
*   Disclose any redemption requirements
*   Include billing expectations, additional charges, minimum purchase limits, and more
*   Clearly state the conditions and any restrictions or limitations of the offer

Titles **can't**:

*   Attempt to trick or mislead customers
*   Keep additional fees hidden until checkout

Read our [editorial requirements](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/2877578) for a complete list, including best practices, and instructions on how to format your promotion's text. To optimize the quality of your promotions, Google may contact your business to request changes based on these guidelines.

### Promotional title modification

To ensure the information presented to customers is clear and consistent, Google or its affiliates may modify your promotion title. These modifications are based solely on the details you have provided and will not change the fundamental meaning or value of your promotion. The goal is to ensure your promotion title accurately reflects the conditions you've set.

Modifications may include:

*   **Aligning the title with details**: We may update the title to include missing conditions or incentives from your promotion's details. For instance, if your title is "10% off" but your promotion requires a $50 minimum purchase, we may update it to "10% off orders over $50".
*   **Ensuring consistency**: If the promotion's conditions or shopper incentive don't match what is stated in the title, we may update them to be consistent, using only the information you provided across all fields.
*   **Standard formatting**: We may also make non-material changes to size, formatting, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling.

* * *

Follow redemption requirements
------------------------------

Retailers must not impose deal-specific costs on users upon redemption if these costs don't apply to non-deal purchases. When customers redeem a promotion, they shouldn't be subject to fees which don't apply to someone not redeeming a promotion.

It’s recommended that your promotion details are shown to customers on your product landing page before they sign up on your website. If your website requires phone number or email verification to get the promotion, ensure that this requirement is included in the promotion details before asking your customers to sign up and verify their phone number or email.

Promotions must be redeemable without unspecified additional user requirements. Deals where retailers impose requirements not included in titles in order to redeem are not permissible. Unacceptable additional requirements include, but are not limited to:

*   Sign up for store credit card
*   Sign up for paid membership
*   Take this survey to redeem the promotion

* * *

Avoid overly restrictive promotions
-----------------------------------

Promotions must be generally accessible to all customers. Promotions available only to a subset of customers or specific payment methods that are different from the website’s normal payment restrictions are unacceptable. Examples of overly restrictive promotions can include, but are not limited to:

*   $10 off for Teachers & Students
*   10% off for Seniors and Military
*   $15 off on your birthday
*   10% discount with Like
*   5% off with Visa credit card
*   10% off when you complete a short survey at checkout

Although you can't require users to sign up for a paid membership in order to redeem a promotion, you can offer promotions for discounts on membership fees. For example, a 20% discount on annual membership fees. You're able to offer promotions applicable to free membership programs as long as the condition is specified in the title. We also allow a free or discounted trial period for subscription services as a promotion.

Promotions with additional requirements like subscribe and save, first order, sign up for email, and text are allowed. Make sure these requirements are specified in the promotion creation flow.

If you’re using Performance Max or Standard Shopping campaigns in your Google Ads account, we recommend that you set up [1st Order Promotion](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/16310477) and set up a new customer acquisition goal to help increase the number of new customers your campaigns acquire. [Learn more about the new customer acquisition goal](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12080169).

* * *

Make promoted products clear to the shopper
-------------------------------------------

Customers must be able to redeem promotions for all eligible products. When a promotion is limited to specific products, it must be applicable to only the specific products identified in your products data source.

**Bundled promotions must clearly disclose all items**. If a combination of products must be added to qualify for the promotion, the title should clearly state all products that must be added.

* * *

Make confirmation of promotion receipt clear
--------------------------------------------

A customer's receipt of promotions must be clearly confirmed by the point of purchase, given in the cart or at checkout and not on the product landing page.

Discounts must not already be shown on the product landing page. If your promotion says “$10 off” and a customer is purchasing a $100 item, they'd also expect to find the item priced at $100 on your landing page where they could then redeem the promotion. If your landing page shows the item’s price at $90 because the discount was already factored in, customer may expect $10 off on the item’s price at $90 which could be confusing.

Check [Shopping ads policies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970) for more information. The price in your products data source, which is the price that we also show in ads and free listings, must match the price on the landing page.

Receipt of free gifts, gift cards or e-cards can be displayed on the product landing pages, and must also be mentioned in one of the following locations:

*   Cart or basket
*   Checkout page

**Note**: Free gift cards for stores other than your own are not permissible. Additionally, sample products or trials don’t qualify as free gifts. Store credit and reward points are permissible only in monetary value. To review title guidelines for gifts, refer to the [editorial requirements](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/2877578).

* * *

Include redemption code for shipping promotions
-----------------------------------------------

A shipping promotion must have a valid redemption code or it won't be considered an added value. If free shipping is already offered on your site at a certain threshold without a code, you can still offer free shipping at a lower amount as long as it's associated with a code.

**Note**: If your promotion offers shipping at a lower threshold, promotions shouldn’t be tied to items priced above the normally offered threshold. The promotion must have a product applicability of `Specific products` and be mapped only to products that are priced below the offered amount.

For example, if free shipping is already given for orders $45+ without a code and you'd like for free shipping to be given at $35+ with a code, you should only map the promotion to items that are priced below $45.

* * *

Follow local promotions policies
--------------------------------

A local promotion must provide a valid promotion URL where the promotion details can be verified. It must be a link that directs to a web page within the same website where users can find promotion details and redemption small print.

If promotion is eligible for curbside pickup, the promotion URL page should clearly state that the promotion is redeemed online for curbside pickup.

* * *

Follow combined promotions policies
-----------------------------------

Some promotions that are not permissible as standalones can become permissible when combined with another promotion that provides additional value for customers.

| Example Title | Allowed |
| --- | --- |
| 10% off on all products with free shipping | Yes - Allowed with or without a shipping redemption code |
| $50 mail-in or email rebate and $25 instant discount for $300+ purchase | Yes - Rebate promotion combined with instant discount promotion is considered an added value promotion |
| $50 mail-in or email rebate plus free shipping sitewide | Yes - If promotion contains valid shipping redemption code<br><br>No - If promotion is missing shipping redemption code |
| Free camera lens + 2% rewards | Yes - Rewards promotion combined with a free gift is considered an added value |
| 20% off + Buy one get one free | Yes - If 20% discount is reflected in checkout page<br><br>No - If 20% discount is given in product landing page already and the checkout page price is same as product landing page price |

In some cases of repeated policy violations, you'll receive a warning notification email. If you don't respond to the email or continue to violate Google’s policies, the promotions feature will be deactivated from your Merchant Center account. Any promotions in the deactivated account won't longer display, and you will not be able to submit new data.

Exceptions
----------

The following Shopping ads policies don't apply to local inventory ads and free local product listings:

*   **Online payment and transaction requirements**. Your site doesn't require an online checkout and payment option. If you offer online checkout and payment, you must adhere to website policies, including the posting of return and refund information. [Learn more about quality standards for your ads and website](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149970#ed)
*   **Shipping**. Given that local inventory ads and free local product listings require an in-store purchase and pickup, no shipping information is required.

Additional requirements

*   You must have a local brick and mortar business location where customers can physically visit, view, and purchase the desired item.
*   If you require customers to be a club or store member to purchase products, you’re ineligible to participate in local inventory ads and free local product listings. However, you’re eligible to participate if non-members are also allowed to purchase, even if at a different price. If you offer tiered pricing, you must submit the non-member price using the [price `[price]`](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324371) attribute and ensure this non-member price is clearly displayed on your landing page. Member-specific pricing must be submitted using the [loyalty program `[loyalty_program]`](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/14819809#loyalty_program) attribute.
*   You must include any additional fees charged at checkout in the total product price. Follow tax and pricing according to your online offers and add any other additional fees to the product [price](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324371). For additional fees charged only in certain locations, we recommend using [merchant hosted local storefront (full)](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9212322) so your products are eligible to serve for all locations.
*   You can't advertise via local inventory ads and free local product listings if your store's primary purpose is to promote products that violate Shopping ads' content policies.
*   You must be physically located in the country for which your ads are targeted.

Your customers' PII shouldn't be provided with any local inventory ads and free local product listings data. For example, don't include names, email addresses, phone numbers, customer identifiers, payment method information, credit card information, club card codes, or any other demographic information that would allow attribution of such information to a particular individual.

If you breach this provision and provide PII to Google, you remain solely responsible for the disclosed PII.

Google won't disclose timestamps, inventory numbers, quantities, or extended amounts that are identifiable to your company. However, Google may publicly disclose generalized availability data.

### Tip

Safety and security
===================

If you believe a Google Customer Reviews participant is in violation of one of the policies below, please let us know by filling out the [Google Customer Reviews report violation form](https://support.google.com/merchants/contact/gcr_merchant_contact?previewKey=5005707) so we can investigate. We take action on content and products that violate our policies. This may include disapproving violating content or product, as well as issuing warnings or suspending accounts for repeated or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously.

User safety
-----------

This policy is a comprehensive policy that was developed to help protect users from ads, free listings, websites, and businesses that appear to be generally deceptive or misleading, and/or violate our [Google Customer Reviews program agreement](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7180092).

Google requires that Google Customer Reviews participants provide transparency into the business and product that's being promoted. Google also requires that retailers set realistic expectations about what their products can do for their users.

Guidance for Google Customer Review participants includes not making misleading claims:

*   Promote offerings with realistic, credible, and reasonable claims. For example, don't promote "get rich quick" programs.
*   Provide users with accurate information about the risks associated with their product or service
*   Include relevant and easy to find disclaimers when testimonials and endorsements imply that results are typical
*   Provide users with accurate information about the risks associated with their product. For example, if a site promotes health care products, side effects and risks associated with the product, if any, should be clearly disclosed.
*   Promote acceptable business models
*   Make it clear to users what your business does and how it works
*   Make sure that your sites display any relevant disclaimers or announcements that may be required by local law. For example, certain types of financial service providers may need to include specific text per governmental regulations.
*   Promote transparency and accuracy
*   Provide users with accurate contact information
*   Include links to third-party accreditation/endorsement where affiliation is implied. For example, if a website claims to be affiliated with a governmental agency, a link to verification of this affiliation should be included. Use of "gov" or "government" in display URLs and/or use of government emblems may imply affiliation with a government agency and should be verified.

As online advertising and local laws and regulations are constantly evolving, we can't provide an exhaustive list of the kinds of sites that might be in violation of this policy. Please keep in mind that the principles behind the policy are the promotion of transparency, accuracy, and honesty in advertising.

Malware
-------

Google Customer Reviews doesn't allow the participation of sites infected with malware or the sale of malicious software.

The term malware, derived from "malicious software," refers to any software specifically designed to harm a computer or the software it's running. Malware can steal sensitive information (like credit card numbers or passwords) or even send fake emails from a user's email account, often without the user's knowledge.

Malware can be installed on a computer in a number of ways, with or without a user's knowledge, but most commonly occurs when someone visits a contaminated website or downloads seemingly innocent software from the Internet. Malware includes, but isn't limited to, viruses, worms, spyware, and Trojan horses.

It's possible that you may not even be aware that your site is carrying or spreading malware to users accessing your site. This is because malware can be picked up by downloading templates for your site or in code installed for various applications on your site. Common symptoms of malware can include unwanted URL redirects, pop-up ads, altered Google search results, the addition of unwanted browser toolbars or side-search bars, and slow computer speeds.

Recalled products
-----------------

Google Customer Reviews doesn’t allow the promotion of products which are subject to a recall by the manufacturer or any governmental agency, such as the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

Hazardous materials
-------------------

Google Customer Reviews allows the promotion or sale of consumer commodities containing hazardous materials. A consumer commodity is defined as a packaged product intended for retail sale and for personal care or household use. Retailers are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and where appropriate must include a clear description of the hazardous nature of the product.

Some examples of acceptable products include acetone nail polish remover, fluorescent light bulbs, automotive batteries, and aerosol hair spray. Household pesticides are acceptable if the pesticide is registered by the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/), or equivalent country-specific agency, and is labeled to meet agency requirements, including directions for use, ingredient statements, and safety precautions.

Google doesn’t allow the promotion or sale of hazardous or dangerous materials. A hazardous material is defined as any product or substance capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, or property during transportation. Unacceptable products include:

*   Explosive, flammable, or combustible products such as black powder, gasoline, aerosol cans (compressed gases), and pressurize cryogenic liquids
*   Poisonous or toxic substances such as EPA-restricted pesticides, batteries containing mercury, and cyanide
*   Radioactive, corrosive, and miscellaneous dangerous products such as radiation contaminated material, hydrochloric acid, iodine monochloride, and potassium chlorate

Spam techniques
---------------

Google Customer Reviews doesn't allow spam techniques which negatively impact the user experience. These techniques may include the following:

*   Ad spam techniques – exploiting online advertising systems, like Google Ads, for financial gain
*   Bulk marketing techniques – distributing spam to large audiences
*   Web Developer Guidelines violations – promoting websites that violate our [Web Developer Guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769)

Examples of prohibited content include programs which compensate users for clicking ads or offers, performing searches, surfing websites, or reading emails and automated ad clicking software.

Product Ratings policies
========================

### Overview of our Product Ratings policies and how we enforce them

We strive to provide shoppers with access to transparent, authentic, and helpful product reviews to support a trustworthy shopping ecosystem. Our policies are in place to prevent fraudulent, irrelevant, and inappropriate content from being displayed to users. To participate in Product Ratings by uploading a feed of reviews, you must have a minimum of 50 reviews in your Product Ratings feed and follow all policies.

Our Product Ratings policies cover 5 broad areas:

*   [**Comprehensive Updates**](#allreviews): Retailers must share all their reviews with Google through monthly updates
*   [**Content Policies**](#contentpolicies): All reviews must follow Google’s content policies. We may remove reviews or block entire feeds that violate these policies.
*   [**Quality**](#highquality): Review feeds should be of high quality
*   [**Ownership**](#owned): Review feeds should be collected and owned by retailers
*   [**User-Generated Images**](#images): images must adhere to Google’s content and quality policies as well as formatting criteria.

We use a combination of automated and human evaluation to ensure that content and reviews comply with our policies. Our enforcement technologies use machine-learning algorithms to help protect our merchants and users by keeping our shopping platforms safe. More complex, nuanced, or severe cases are reviewed and evaluated by our specially trained experts who conduct content evaluations that might be difficult for algorithms to perform alone, for example, because an understanding of the context of the piece of content is required.

We take action on content and reviews that violate our policies. This may include disapproving content or suspending accounts for repeated or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously. Upon request, we’ll sometimes remove content under applicable laws or in response to a court order. You can submit legal requests [here](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905).

We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If your content is disapproved, you can fix the issue and [request a review or disagree with the decision](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/14620735). If the disapproval remains and you’re uncertain about how to proceed, contact us for support.

* * *

### Retailers must share all their reviews with Google through monthly updates

In order to provide shoppers with a transparent and comprehensive experience, you are required to share all your product reviews with Google, including low-star reviews, unless specifically instructed otherwise. At a minimum, you need to **send your full reviews feed at least once a month**, if not more frequently. We’ve found that the more recent the reviews, the more relevant they are to shoppers researching a product. You may not delete old reviews from the feed. If reviews aren't refreshed every month or if you have stopped actively collecting reviews, your feed will be deemed stale and will lose eligibility to participate in Product Ratings.

* * *

### Review feeds must adhere to content policies

All reviews must follow Google’s content policies. We may remove reviews or block entire feeds that violate these policies.

*   **Conflict of interest**: Reviews are most valuable when they are honest and unbiased. We remove reviews that we believe have conflicts of interest and/or have been written by employees or people with a vested interest in the product. Only submit reviews that were honestly solicited from customers who made a purchase.
*   **Incentivized reviews**: We may display reviews that have been obtained through incentives, such as gift cards or discounts. However, these incentives cannot be dependent on the sentiment of the review. If you provide an incentive for a review, you are required to use the `<is_incentivized_review>` attribute in your feed to properly disclose it.
*   **Spam**: We don’t allow spam content. Ensure any content known to contain irrelevant, repetitive, or nonsensical text is marked as spam in your feed using the `[<is_spam>](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/schema#review)` attribute.
*   **Dangerous products or acts**: Don’t submit reviews of regulated products that can cause damage, harm, or injury. For example, don’t submit reviews of guns, tobacco products, or regulated drugs. Additionally, don’t include content that depicts or provides instructions to complete activities that are dangerous and/or widely illegal.
*   **Phone numbers, email addresses or URLs**: Don't submit phone numbers, email addresses and links to other websites in the review content.
*   **Personal and confidential information**: Don't submit reviews that contain personal information, including but not limited to full names, credit card information, national insurance number, driving license information, and others.
*   **Keep it clean**: Don’t submit reviews that use obscene, profane, or offensive language or include content that depicts scenes of violence, serious injury or death, contains personal attacks, or are defamatory.
*   **Illegal content**: Don't submit reviews that contain or link to unlawful content, such as links that facilitate the sale of prescription drugs without a prescription, illegal drugs, counterfeit products, or illicit weapons. This content is not allowed.
*   **Malware & Phishing**: Don’t submit reviews containing links to malware, viruses, or other harmful software. We don't allow phishing or other content that harms or interferes with the operation of the networks, servers, or other infrastructure of Google or others.
*   **Copyrighted content**: Don't submit reviews that infringe on others' rights, including copyright. For more information or to file a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) request, review our [copyright procedures](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905#ts=1115698).
*   **Trademark infringement**: Don’t submit content that uses a trademark in a way that’s likely to cause confusion about the origin of the product being reviewed.
*   **Plagiarism:** Don’t submit reviews containing appropriation of content created by another person or entity.
*   **Automated Content**: We don’t allow reviews that are primarily generated by an automated program or artificial intelligence application. If you have identified such content, it should be marked as spam in your feed using the `[<is_spam>](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/schema#review)` attribute.
*   **Sexually explicit material**: Don't submit reviews that contain sexually explicit material. We also don't allow reviews that sexually exploit children or present them in a sexual manner. For this type of content, we remove the review, shut down the product reviews feed, and send a report to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to law enforcement. This content is not allowed.
*   **Hate speech**: Don't submit reviews that advocate against groups of people based on their race or ethnic origin, nationality, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Violent language, terrorist content, or content intended to incite and encourage violent acts or extremist behavior, are not allowed in reviews.
*   **Cross promotion of other products/websites**: We don’t allow reviews that include promotional content for other unrelated websites, products, or services. If you have identified such content, it should be marked as spam in your feed using the `<is_spam>` attribute.
*   **Off-topic reviews**: We may remove reviews that primarily seek to discuss other topics unrelated to the product itself. This includes comments about shipping and delivery, experiences with particular retailers, political or social controversy, attacks on others, or don't represent a first-hand experience with the product. This also includes merchant responses to reviewer comments.
*   **Impersonation**: We don't allow reviews from people claiming to be someone that they aren't.
*   **Language**: Reviews should be submitted in the original language they are written in. Google will display reviews in the original language with an option on the Shopping page to be translated to the user’s language.
*   **Duplicate content**: Each review should only appear in one feed and only once in that feed. If a review applies to multiple variations of a product, this should be designated by including multiple [unique product identifiers](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160161) and URLs with the review. The same review shouldn't appear in feeds from different retailers. The retailer should own the review and shouldn't send Google content syndicated from other sources. In the case of duplicate reviews in multiple feeds, we may blocklist one or more of the reviews or entire feeds.

* * *

### Review feeds should be of high quality

The better the overall quality of your reviews, the more impact they have on shoppers’ buying decisions. For feed-based Product Ratings, make sure that your reviews are relevant and provide value when shoppers research a product. A review that simply states, “luv it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):)” has no relevant information and is considered low-quality. Low-quality reviews may not be shown.

For example, we may remove reviews or block entire feeds that contain:

*   **Low quality content**: Partial, incomplete, or extremely short review comments or reviews that contain poor formatting, poor punctuation, or gibberish.
*   **Boilerplate text**: For example text that is pre-populated for users.
*   **Non-functional content**: Product URLs `[[product_url](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/schema#product)]` must lead to the merchant’s site, and shouldn’t be all the same. Active product pages should display reviews. Review URLs `[[review_url](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/schema#review_url)]` should be functional and lead to a page where reviews are displayed.

Our program policies don't allow you to convert a review system with fewer than 5 stars to a 5-star review system. For example, you may not assign a star rating to a Yes/No question such as “Will you buy this product again?”

* * *

### Review feeds should be collected and owned by retailers

You must collect and own the reviews you share with Google. You can share reviews directly or through an [approved third-party aggregator](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/14620160), but we don't accept reviews syndicated from other sources.

There are a few exceptions to this policy:

*   Retailers whose e-commerce site is hosted by an online marketplace that collects and shares reviews for these retailers.
*   If a business manages accounts on behalf of a retailer that wants to share reviews with Google, those managed accounts are eligible.
*   A retailer may send a single review feed for all its subsidiaries if the retailer collects reviews for all of these subsidiaries and it isn't possible to assign review ownership to each individual subsidiary. If this applies to you, [get in touch with us](https://support.google.com/merchants/contact/product_ratings).

* * *

### User generated images in product reviews

Feeds can contain images owned and submitted by users for product reviews. User owned and generated images must adhere to Google’s content and quality policies mentioned previously as well as formatting criteria.

**Image style** - Formatting Do’s and Don'ts

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Submit high quality photos (high resolution) from your customers | Submit dark or blurry photos |
| Submit photos that your customers have taken themselves | Use images that the customers didn't take themselves |
| Ensure that photos submitted by your customers are relevant | Use customer photos that contain irrelevant imagery, advertising, or promotional material |
| Ensure that photos submitted by your customers use filters minimally | Use customer photos that contain screenshots, drawings, or other non-photos |
| Ensure that photos submitted by your customers use relevant text or overlay | Use customer photos that contain text overlay that is distracting or irrelevant |

Users can provide feedback on images they feel are irrelevant, low quality, and more.

To report an image:

1.  Click the "Feedback" option.
2.  Select the reason most closely matching your feedback.
3.  Click the submit button.

**Note**: Photos taken in private residences, publicly inaccessible locations, or in other private locations shouldn't be published without the owner’s consent. Don't publish photos in which people are identifiable without their permission.

We use a combination of automated and human evaluation to ensure that content and reviews comply with our policies. Our enforcement technologies use machine-learning algorithms to help protect our merchants and users by keeping our shopping platforms safe. More complex, nuanced, or severe cases are reviewed and evaluated by our specially trained experts who conduct content evaluations that might be difficult for algorithms to perform alone, for example, because an understanding of the context of the piece of content is required.

We take action on content and reviews that violate our policies. This may include disapproving violating content or a violating review, as well as issuing warnings or suspending accounts for repeated or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously.

Upon request, we’ll sometimes remove content under applicable laws or in response to a court order. Submit legal requests [here](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905).

* * *

### Request a review for your Product Ratings issues

If your content is disapproved and you’ve fixed the issue or you disagree with the issue, [you can request a review](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/13791045). If the review is successful, your issue will disappear. If the disapproval remains and you’re uncertain how to proceed, contact us for support.

If you’re working with a third-party platform, some of these instructions may not apply to you. Refer to your third-party platform for instructions on how to resolve the issue and request a review.

*   **[Shipping](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7050921):** Given that vehicle ads require an in-store purchase and pickup, no shipping information is required.

Restricted targeting in Personalized advertising
================================================

Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page.

Personalized advertising is a powerful tool that improves the relevance of ads that people see and increases ROI for advertisers. It works by targeting groups of people based on specific criteria you select, then either including or excluding them from an audience. There are restrictions to how you can use targeting when promoting within certain categories to avoid negatively impacting user experience. Refer to [Categories with targeting restrictions](#00) for more details.

Types of targeting restrictions
-------------------------------

The types of products and services you promote will determine the targeting settings you're allowed to use for your ads. If you are not promoting anything within the categories listed on this page, you can use both predefined Google audiences and your own advertiser-curated audiences, though other restrictions may apply.

### Targeting restrictions to Sensitive interest categories

Advertisers promoting products and services that fall within sensitive interest categories are unable to use advertiser-curated audiences. This helps ensure that sensitive interest categories aren’t inadvertently used for targeting audiences. Because predefined Google audiences are expressly configured without sensitive user signals, all advertisers are allowed to use them, even if they promote sensitive interest categories.

Refer to the following non-exhaustive list of targeting features and how personalized ads policies apply.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Advertiser-curated audiences**<br><br>These audiences cannot be used if promoting in sensitive interest categories, because they may inadvertently contain sensitive user signals.3 | **Predefined Google audiences**<br><br>These audiences can be used even if promoting in sensitive interest categories, because the sensitive user signals are automatically excluded from them.**3** |
| Customer match<br><br>Your data segments<br><br>[Audience expansion](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9496986)<br><br>[Lookalike segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13541369) | In-market segments<br><br>Affinity<br><br>Demographics (with exceptions)1<br><br>Detailed demographics (with exceptions)1<br><br>Life events<br><br>Location targeting2<br><br>Custom segments4 |

1\. Certain demographics (age, gender, marital status, parental status) may not be used to target Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada.  
2\. ZIP code location targeting cannot be used for Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada.  
3\. Users under the age of 18 are not eligible for personalized advertising of any kind, including serving based on Predefined Google Audiences. Advertisers using advertiser-curated audiences are prohibited from uploading customer information from viewers of child-directed content.  
4\. Custom Segment audiences using sensitive creative assets or pointing to sensitive landing pages will only serve with Display campaigns to non-sensitive audiences or contextually. All other campaigns using Custom Segment audiences with sensitive creative assets or landing pages will not be eligible to serve.

* * *

Targeting restrictions to Access to opportunities categories (US and Canada)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These restrictions are designed to help ensure equitable access to opportunities in Housing, Employment, and Consumer finance in the United States and Canada. The categories have limited personalization for certain demographics.

#### Targeting dos & don’ts for Access to opportunities categories (non-exhaustive)

You can use predefined Google audiences, excluding the demographics listed below

In the United States and Canada, you can't target audiences using:

> *   Gender
> *   Age
> *   Parental status
> *   Marital status
> *   ZIP codes

[Targeting geographic locations](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722043) using radius, as well as city and country-based targeting is allowed. Radius targeting requires setting at least 1 km around any given location. For Canada, the first 3 letters of postal code (FSA), is acceptable for ad targeting.

Learn more [About audience segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497941) including descriptions of the terms used above. Learn more about [targeting](https://support.google.com/google-ads/topic/10543621) and how to use it.

* * *

Data collection and use in personalized advertising
---------------------------------------------------

These requirements for data collection and use in personalized ads are in addition to the [Google ads policies for data collection and use](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6020956).

You aren't allowed to do the following:

*   Run ads that collect or contain [personally identifiable information (PII)](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7686480), unless using an ad format provided by Google that’s designed for that purpose.
    *   **Examples (non-exhaustive)**: Collecting email addresses, telephone numbers, or credit card numbers within the ad itself.
*   Use PII in connection with any anonymous or pseudonymous information, including in your data segments (previously called remarketing), cookies, or data feeds.
*   Share PII with Google through your data segments tags or any product data feeds that might be associated with ads.
*   Send Google precise location information without first obtaining users' consent.
*   Use your data segments in a way that targets an overly narrow or specific audience. This includes the case where combining your data segments with other targeting criteria (such as geographic limitations or other user segmentation) results in an ad targeted to a relatively small number of users. Learn more about the [size of your data segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2472738#listsize).

For your data segments:

*   You can choose to disable the collection of data segments for users who do not wish to view personalized ads by using the parameter: allow\_ad\_personalization\_signals. Learn more about how to modify the global site tag to [Disable the collection of personalized advertising data](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9606827) for specific users.
*   When using your data segments, re-engagement, or similar segments features, learn [what to include in your privacy policy for your data segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2549063).
*   Google may include in-ad notice labels to disclose personalized advertising to people, and may display which of your data segments they're on, along with the corresponding domain name. You must not modify or obscure these notices. If you want to implement your own in-ad notice, it must only be done in compliance with relevant industry standards.
*   Google won't allow another advertiser to use your data segments or similar segments lists without your consent.

* * *

Options to fix ads in Sensitive interest categories
---------------------------------------------------

If your ads are flagged for the personalized advertising policy, you should review your site or app as well as your ad content to ensure if they fall in this policy. You then have 3 options to fix your ads.

### Option 1: Edit your ad targeting

Review and remove any advertiser-curated audiences from the targeting settings of your ad. Check the targeting settings of ad groups, asset groups, and campaigns to make sure they aren't using these audiences either. 

### Option 2: Edit or remove content that falls within this policy

1.  From your **site** or **app**
2.  From your **ads**

#### How to edit your ad content

1.  Go to [**Ads**](https://ads.google.com/aw/ads) within the **Campaigns** menu.
2.  Hover over the ad or asset and select **Edit**.
3.  Edit the ad or asset so that it complies with the policy.
4.  Select **Save**.

Your ad will be automatically reviewed again. Check the ad’s status in the "Ads & assets" page for updates.

Learn more about how to [Fix an ad with policy violations](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9338593).

### Option 3: Appeal the policy decision

If you believe there’s been an error and that your site or app or ads don’t fall under this policy, [appeal](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9338593) the policy decision directly from your Google Ads account to request a review. If the review determines that your ads are compliant, they can run again. If you aren't able to fix these violations or choose not to, [remove your ad](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375362) to help prevent your account from becoming suspended in the future for repeated policy violations.

Options to fix ads in "Access to opportunities" categories
----------------------------------------------------------

If your ads are flagged for personalized ads policy, you should review your site or app as well as your ad content to ensure if they fall in this policy. You then have 3 options to fix your ads.

### Option 1: Edit your ad targeting

If your ads target the United States or Canada:

1.  Set all demographics (gender, age, parental status, marital status) to “Enable”.

Google Ads policy information
-----------------------------

Google's personalized ads policies work in combination with other policies across Ads and all of Google. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with the policy. Google's [privacy policy](https://privacy.google.com/) applies to all Google features and dictates how Google collects, uses, and protects user data. Learn [what happens if you violate our policies](https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/7187501). Advertisers are also required to comply with our policies for [European Union user consent](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html), where applicable.

What happens if you violate our policies
========================================

Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page.

To ensure a safe and positive experience for users, Google requires that advertisers comply with all [applicable laws and regulations](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023676) in addition to the [Google Ads policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942). Ads, assets, destinations, and other content that violate these policies can be blocked on the Google Ads platform and associated networks.

How does Google Ads detect policy violations?
---------------------------------------------

We use a combination of Google's AI and human evaluation to detect and remove ads and accounts which violate our policies and are harmful to users and the overall Google Ads ecosystem. Our enforcement technologies use Google's AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. The policy-violating content is either blocked from serving by our automated models or, where a more nuanced determination is required, it is flagged for further review by trained operators and analysts who conduct content evaluations that might be difficult for algorithms to perform alone, for example because an understanding of the context of the ad and account is required. The results of these manual reviews are then used to help build training data to further improve our machine learning models.

In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating our policies, we review information from a variety of sources, including ads, accounts, websites, content, user complaints, consumer reviews, regulatory warnings and rulings, and other third-party sources.

Below is a list of various ways we enforce policies and laws.

* * *

Ad or asset disapproval
-----------------------

Ads and assets that don't follow Google Ads policies will be disapproved. A disapproved ad won't be able to run until the policy violation is fixed and the ad is reviewed. In Google Ads, this will be noted in the "Status" column. [Learn how to fix a disapproved ad](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/1704381)

* * *

Ad serving eligibility
----------------------

An ad will be marked "Eligible (limited all locations)" when Google Ads policies (common examples include Alcohol, Copyrights, Gambling, Healthcare, and Trademarks) prevent certain types of ads from showing in your targeted locations. Depending on the policy topic, available certification and verification programs, and target country, the ads can serve on a limited basis. Learn more about [ad serving eligibility](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9127662).

* * *

Account suspension
------------------

Accounts may be suspended if we find violations of our policies or the Terms & Conditions.

If we detect an egregious violation, your account will be suspended immediately without prior warning. An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users or our digital advertising ecosystem. Egregious violations often reflect that the advertiser's overall business does not adhere to Google Ads policies or that one violation is so severe that we cannot risk future exposure to our users. Given that egregious violations will cause immediate account suspension, upon detection and without prior warning, we limit these to cases when such action is the only effective method to adequately prevent illegal activity and/or significant user harm.

For other violations that lead to account suspension, we will send you a warning to outline the nature of the policy violation and any remedial action that can be taken, in order to comply. This notification will be sent at least 7 days before suspension action.

For repeat violations of a policy, we issue strikes to your Google ads account and penalties progressively increase with each subsequent strike leading up to account suspension. You will receive a maximum of 3 strikes per policy on your Google Ads account. Learn more [about enforcement procedures for repeat violations](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10922738).

If we suspend your account, all ads in the suspended account will stop running, and we will no longer accept advertising from you, **unless successfully appealed**. Any related accounts (for example, accounts using the same payment method) will also be suspended, and any new accounts you create will be automatically suspended. Learn more about [suspended accounts.](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/2375414)

* * *

Remarketing list disabling
--------------------------

Remarketing lists that don’t follow the [Personalized advertising policy](https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/143465) may be disabled. These lists can no longer be used with ad campaigns, and new users won’t be added to the lists. List creation restrictions may apply to both individual web pages and entire websites or apps.

* * *

Compliance review
-----------------

We may review your business for compliance with the [Customer Match policy](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717) at any time. If we contact you to request information related to compliance, you're required to respond in a timely manner and swiftly take any corrective action needed to follow our policies. If you have a manager account, we may also contact your managed accounts to verify compliance.

Restricted targeting in Personalized advertising
================================================

Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page.

Personalized advertising is a powerful tool that improves the relevance of ads that people see and increases ROI for advertisers. It works by targeting groups of people based on specific criteria you select, then either including or excluding them from an audience. There are restrictions to how you can use targeting when promoting within certain categories to avoid negatively impacting user experience. Refer to [Categories with targeting restrictions](#00) for more details.

You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. If you advertise in one or more of these categories, you’ll need to comply with targeting restrictions. Refer to all categories that relate to your ads for details.

Types of targeting restrictions
-------------------------------

The types of products and services you promote will determine the targeting settings you're allowed to use for your ads. If you are not promoting anything within the categories listed on this page, you can use both predefined Google audiences and your own advertiser-curated audiences, though other restrictions may apply.

### Targeting restrictions to Sensitive interest categories

Advertisers promoting products and services that fall within sensitive interest categories are unable to use advertiser-curated audiences. This helps ensure that sensitive interest categories aren’t inadvertently used for targeting audiences. Because predefined Google audiences are expressly configured without sensitive user signals, all advertisers are allowed to use them, even if they promote sensitive interest categories.

Refer to the following non-exhaustive list of targeting features and how personalized ads policies apply.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Advertiser-curated audiences**<br><br>These audiences cannot be used if promoting in sensitive interest categories, because they may inadvertently contain sensitive user signals.3 | **Predefined Google audiences**<br><br>These audiences can be used even if promoting in sensitive interest categories, because the sensitive user signals are automatically excluded from them.**3** |
| Customer match<br><br>Your data segments<br><br>[Audience expansion](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9496986)<br><br>[Lookalike segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13541369) | In-market segments<br><br>Affinity<br><br>Demographics (with exceptions)1<br><br>Detailed demographics (with exceptions)1<br><br>Life events<br><br>Location targeting2<br><br>Custom segments4 |

1\. Certain demographics (age, gender, marital status, parental status) may not be used to target Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada.  
2\. ZIP code location targeting cannot be used for Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada.  
3\. Users under the age of 18 are not eligible for personalized advertising of any kind, including serving based on Predefined Google Audiences. Advertisers using advertiser-curated audiences are prohibited from uploading customer information from viewers of child-directed content.  
4\. Custom Segment audiences using sensitive creative assets or pointing to sensitive landing pages will only serve with Display campaigns to non-sensitive audiences or contextually. All other campaigns using Custom Segment audiences with sensitive creative assets or landing pages will not be eligible to serve.

* * *

Targeting restrictions to Access to opportunities categories (US and Canada)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These restrictions are designed to help ensure equitable access to opportunities in Housing, Employment, and Consumer finance in the United States and Canada. The categories have limited personalization for certain demographics.

#### Targeting dos & don’ts for Access to opportunities categories (non-exhaustive)

You can use predefined Google audiences, excluding the demographics listed below

In the United States and Canada, you can't target audiences using:

> *   Gender
> *   Age
> *   Parental status
> *   Marital status
> *   ZIP codes

[Targeting geographic locations](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722043) using radius, as well as city and country-based targeting is allowed. Radius targeting requires setting at least 1 km around any given location. For Canada, the first 3 letters of postal code (FSA), is acceptable for ad targeting.

Learn more [About audience segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497941) including descriptions of the terms used above. Learn more about [targeting](https://support.google.com/google-ads/topic/10543621) and how to use it.

* * *

Data collection and use in personalized advertising
---------------------------------------------------

These requirements for data collection and use in personalized ads are in addition to the [Google ads policies for data collection and use](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6020956).

You aren't allowed to do the following:

*   Run ads that collect or contain [personally identifiable information (PII)](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7686480), unless using an ad format provided by Google that’s designed for that purpose.
    *   **Examples (non-exhaustive)**: Collecting email addresses, telephone numbers, or credit card numbers within the ad itself.
*   Use PII in connection with any anonymous or pseudonymous information, including in your data segments (previously called remarketing), cookies, or data feeds.
*   Share PII with Google through your data segments tags or any product data feeds that might be associated with ads.
*   Send Google precise location information without first obtaining users' consent.
*   Use your data segments in a way that targets an overly narrow or specific audience. This includes the case where combining your data segments with other targeting criteria (such as geographic limitations or other user segmentation) results in an ad targeted to a relatively small number of users. Learn more about the [size of your data segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2472738#listsize).

For your data segments:

*   You can choose to disable the collection of data segments for users who do not wish to view personalized ads by using the parameter: allow\_ad\_personalization\_signals. Learn more about how to modify the global site tag to [Disable the collection of personalized advertising data](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9606827) for specific users.
*   When using your data segments, re-engagement, or similar segments features, learn [what to include in your privacy policy for your data segments](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2549063).
*   Google may include in-ad notice labels to disclose personalized advertising to people, and may display which of your data segments they're on, along with the corresponding domain name. You must not modify or obscure these notices. If you want to implement your own in-ad notice, it must only be done in compliance with relevant industry standards.
*   Google won't allow another advertiser to use your data segments or similar segments lists without your consent.

* * *

Options to fix ads in Sensitive interest categories

Egregious policy violations
---------------------------

What is an egregious policy violation?
--------------------------------------

An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users or our digital advertising ecosystem. Egregious violations often reflect that the advertiser's overall business does not adhere to Google Ads policies or that one violation is so severe that we cannot risk future exposure to our users.

Given that egregious violations will cause immediate account suspension, upon detection and without prior warning, we limit these to cases when such action is the only effective method to adequately prevent illegal activity and significant user harm.

* * *

What happens if an egregious violation is detected?
---------------------------------------------------

If we detect an egregious violation, we will suspend your Google Ads accounts immediately without prior warning. You will not be allowed to advertise with us again.

* * *

How many times can advertisers appeal their account suspension status?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you file too many appeals for the same account suspension, we may not process them to ensure the overall stability of our systems operations. Submitting one appeal at a time ensures timely response and review.

If we have indications that you are misusing our appeals function, we will suspend processing of certain appeals for 7 days.

Fix your suspended account
--------------------------

If you believe there’s been an error and that you haven’t violated Google Ads' policies, submit an appeal.

*   In your Google Ads account, click the **Contact Us** link in the notification at the top of your screen.
*   This link will direct you to the appeal form on the right side of your screen.
*   While you complete the form, relevant policy information will appear to help you understand the reason for the suspension and the appeal process.

If you select **Contact Us** again while your appeal is still being processed, your Google Ads account will have an “Appeal pending” status. When your appeal is reviewed, you'll receive an email with the outcome. If your appeal is rejected, you can re-appeal following the same process outlined above.

Certain selected advertisers must complete [advertiser verification](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9703665#900) successfully to appeal their account suspension. If Google isn't able to verify their identity after 3 attempts, they won't be allowed to appeal their account suspension. Advertisers suspended for [Billing and Payment suspensions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13704200) may be asked to verify their payment method to process their appeals.

Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, such as in the case of a mistake, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### How does Google Ads detect policy violations?

We use a combination of Google's AI and human evaluation to detect and remove ads and accounts which violate our policies and are harmful to users and the overall Google Ads ecosystem. Our enforcement technologies use Google's AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. The policy-violating content is either blocked from serving by our automated models or, where a more nuanced determination is required, it is flagged for further review by trained operators and analysts who conduct content evaluations that might be difficult for algorithms to perform alone, for example because an understanding of the context of the ad and account is required. The results of these manual reviews are then used to help build training data to further improve our machine learning models.

We take action on ads that violate our policies. This may include disapproving ads so they don’t serve, and suspending or pausing accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders.

In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating our policies, we review information from a variety of sources, including ads, accounts, websites, content, user complaints, consumer reviews, regulatory warnings and rulings, and other third-party sources.

### Are there any other policy violations that can lead to an account suspension?

Yes. Violations of any Google Ads policy can lead to an account suspension. If an advertiser violates or repeatedly violates a Google Ads advertising policy, we will send a warning to outline the nature of the policy violation and any remedial action that can be taken, in order to comply. At that time, the advertiser will be given an opportunity to remedy the violation or, if they do not believe they have violated the policy, explain why they do not believe they are in violation of the policy. This notification will be sent at least 7 days before suspension action.

Repeated violations is a strike-based system. Strikes are issued to your Google Ads account when you repeatedly violate certain Google Ads policies. Note that no strikes are issued for the first policy violation. You'll receive a maximum of three strikes, and the penalties applied with each strike will progressively increase. Temporary account holds will be applied for the first and second strikes (for three and seven days respectively), while the third strike will result in an account suspension. Learn more [about enforcement procedures for repeat violations](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10922738).

### How will an advertiser be notified of a suspension?

Advertisers whose accounts are suspended will receive an in-account notification and an email notification. The email notification will identify all policies the advertiser has been suspended for violating and a link to submit an appeal.

For repeat violations of a policy, we issue strikes to your Google ads account and penalties progressively increase with each subsequent strike leading up to account suspension. You will receive a maximum of 3 strikes per policy on your Google Ads account. Learn more [about enforcement procedures for repeat violations](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10922738).

If we suspend your account, all ads in the suspended account will stop running, and you will no longer be able to advertise from your suspended account until the account is reinstated.

### Do account suspensions apply globally?

All Google Ads accounts, irrespective of location, may be subject to account suspensions if found to be in violation of our policies or Terms and Conditions. Suspended accounts are prohibited from serving and showing ads in all locations.

### How long is the Google Ads account suspended for?

Once the Google Ads account is suspended, this is considered permanent unless the appeal is submitted and the account is successfully reinstated. All advertisers have at least 6 months from the date of account suspension to submit an appeal.

### Can an account suspension be appealed?

Yes. If you believe there’s been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policies, [submit an appeal](https://ads.google.com/nav/login?dst=/aw/overview?supportResource%3Dsuspension_help). To appeal multiple suspensions for your accounts and related accounts, please submit a separate appeal for each suspended account. In each appeal, include any relevant information and an explanation of why you believe the suspension is incorrect. If your account was suspended because other accounts verified using the same identity documents were suspended, your account will be automatically reinstated once those other accounts are successfully appealed.

Before appealing, please ensure that all linked (or previously linked) and all related accounts comply with Google's policies, as outlined in our Terms of Service.

Certain selected advertisers must complete [advertiser verification](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9703665#900) successfully in order to appeal their account suspension. If we are unable to verify their identity after 3 attempts, they will not be allowed to appeal their account suspension.

We only reinstate accounts in compelling circumstances, such as in the case of a mistake, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest.

### Can a suspended advertiser set up or use other accounts?

Accounts related to the suspended account may be suspended. We take the safety of users very seriously, so advertiser actions that put our users, Google, or our partners at risk result in a ban from using Google Ads. In addition any new accounts that the advertiser tries to create may also be suspended. We highly recommend that advertisers reinstate all the suspended ads accounts first, before attempting to create new accounts.

### Can an advertiser access their suspended accounts?

Suspended accounts cannot run any ads. Advertisers can still view their suspended accounts and any associated reports. However, advertisers may not be able to access suspended accounts after an extended period.

### How to request a refund

If your account was suspended, and you qualify for a refund, you can always cancel your account and receive your refund.

*   [Cancel your account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2424604)
*   [Request a refund](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1703646)

### What account actions are available to advertisers with suspended accounts?

Suspended accounts are in read-only mode, with a few exceptions. Advertisers will still be able to access their accounts but will be limited to the following actions:

> *   **Account settings**: Cancel account, claim refunds
> *   **Billing options**: Make a payment, download tax documents, add a payment method. 
> *   **Appeals and verification**: Appeal suspension, advertiser verification 
> *   **Security Settings**: Update security settings within the Google Ads account
> *   Navigate to any page on their Google ads account
> *   Read information from their Google account and download associated reports

About enforcement procedures for repeat violations
==================================================

Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page.

As noted in our advertising [Terms and Conditions](https://ads.google.com/select/tsandcsfinder), Google reserves the right to refuse ads or suspend ad accounts when necessary. To help ensure a safe and positive experience for users, Google requires that advertisers comply with [Google Ads policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942). We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and take action against advertisers for non-compliance.

We use a combination of Google's AI and human evaluation to detect and remove ads which violate our policies and are harmful to users and the overall Google Ads ecosystem. Our enforcement technologies may use Google's AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. The policy-violating content is either removed by Google's AI or, where a more nuanced determination is required, it is flagged for further review by trained operators and analysts who conduct content evaluations that might be difficult for algorithms to perform alone, for example because an understanding of the context of the ad is required. The results of these manual reviews are then used to help build training data to further improve our machine learning models.

We take action on ads that violate our policies. This may include disapproving ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders.

Strikes are issued to your Google Ads account when you repeatedly violate certain Google Ads policies. Note that no strikes are issued for the first policy violation. You will be able to receive a maximum of 3 strikes, and the penalties applied with each strike will progressively increase. Temporary account holds will be applied for the first and second strikes (for 3 and 7 days respectively), while the third strike will result in an account suspension.

This strike-based system applies to the following policies: Enabling dishonest behavior, Unapproved substances, Guns, gun parts and related products, Explosives, Other Weapons, Tobacco, Compensated sexual acts, Mail-order brides, Clickbait, Misleading ad design, Bail bond services, Call directories, forwarding, and recording services, Credit repair services, Binary options, and Personal loans.

**What happens if you get a strike**
------------------------------------

A strike is issued to your Google Ads account via an email and an in-account notification when your assets or ads violate a Google Ads policy multiple times. An account can receive a maximum of one warning and 3 strikes per policy violation.

Warning
-------

We understand mistakes happen and you don’t mean to violate our policies — that’s why the first violation is only a warning. Note that you’ll only be warned once through an email notification. The next time your ads violate a Google Ads policy, you'll get a strike. If you think we made a mistake, you can appeal the disapproved ads.

Read more about appeals [here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704381).

First Strike
------------

You will earn your first strike when we detect that you have continued to violate a specific Google Ads policy, even after receiving an initial warning.

Your account will be in a temporary hold state for 3 days when you receive the first strike. If you take no action to either acknowledge or appeal the strike, your account will continue to remain on hold. See more information in the [“What to do if you get a Strike”](#400) section.

Accounts in a temporary hold state cannot run any ads. Advertisers can, however, still access their accounts and all associated reports. Learn more about [temporary account hold](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10925465).

Second Strike
-------------

You will receive a second strike if you violate the same policy again within 90 days of the first strike. It will serve as the last and final notice for you to remove all policy violating assets or ads in your Google Ads account to avoid being suspended.

Your account will be in a temporary hold state for 7 days upon receiving the second strike. If you take no action to either acknowledge or appeal the strike, your account will continue to remain on hold. See more information in the “What to do if you get a Strike” section.

Accounts in a temporary hold state cannot run any ads. Advertisers can, however, still access their accounts and all associated reports. Learn more about [temporary account hold](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10925465).

We will send you an email notification when your account is released from temporary hold.

Third Strike
------------

You will receive a third and final strike if you violate the same policy within 90 days of the second strike. Your account will then be suspended for repeat violation of our policies. Learn more about [account suspensions](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/2375414).

**What to do if you get a strike**
----------------------------------

Your account may be in a temporary hold state or suspended. The temporary hold state or suspension is determined by the number of strikes accumulated in your account for a given policy.

If your account is in a temporary hold state
--------------------------------------------

To resume serving ads, you will be required to correct the violations and to submit an acknowledgement form. If you believe there has been an error and that you haven’t violated our policies, you will need to [appeal the strike](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/appeal_strikes). Note that your account will continue to remain on hold until you take action to either acknowledge or appeal the strike.

If you choose to appeal the strike and it is unsuccessful, you’d still be required to remove or fix the policy violations and acknowledge the strike to release your account from a temporary hold state.

##### **Acknowledgement of the strike**

To acknowledge the strike, you must remove or fix all policy violations in your account and complete the [acknowledgement form](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/appeal_strikes).

By completing the acknowledgement form, you affirm that:

*   You are aware of the specific policy or policies that led to a strike being issued on the account, that you have reviewed the policies in question, and that you understand that additional violations of these policies can lead to more severe action, up to and including account suspension.
*   You have removed the assets and ads that violate the policies in question and you will ensure that future assets and ads will comply with our policies.
*   Creating additional accounts and/or attempting to circumvent Google’s policy enforcement is strictly prohibited and can lead to account suspension.

Once the acknowledgement form is submitted, your account will resume serving ads within a specific period of time, depending on the number of strikes accumulated.

*   For the first strike, your account will resume serving ads 3 days after the temporary hold was initiated.
*   For the second strike, your account will resume serving ads 7 days after the temporary hold was initiated.

If you are modifying existing ads or uploading new ads, please ensure that they comply with the relevant policy. If you create new policy violating ads while your account is in a temporary hold state, you will be issued an additional strike.

Google will continue to monitor your account for repeat violations of our Ads policies.

##### Appeal

If you successfully appeal the strike, it will be removed from your account and the compliant ads will be approved. Your account will be released from temporary hold immediately.

If your appeal is unsuccessful, your account will continue to remain in a hold state until you fix all policy violations in your account and complete [the acknowledgement form](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/contact/appeal_strikes).

If your account is suspended
----------------------------

If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, please [submit an appeal](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9841640) to explain why. We only reinstate accounts under compelling circumstances, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more about [suspended accounts](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/2375414).

Eligible (limited all locations): Definition
============================================

A status given to ads that comply with our policies but can’t run in your targeted locations because of policy restrictions and targeting settings. The ad can run, however, to people [interested in your targeted locations](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453995#locationinterest).

An ad will be marked "Eligible (limited all locations)" when Google Ads policies (common examples include [Alcohol](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6012382), [Copyrights](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6018015), [Gambling](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6018017), [Healthcare](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/176031), and [Trademarks](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6118)) prevent certain types of ads from showing in your targeted locations.

For example:

*   Google Ads policy does not permit ads promoting the sale of alcohol in countries not listed on our Alcohol policy page. If an ad promoting the sale of alcohol targets an unlisted country, it will be marked as Eligible (limited all locations).

What you can do
---------------

Here are some steps you can take:

*   If you want the ad to run in your targeted locations, [fix the ad](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704381) so it complies with the policy requirements for your targeted location.
    
*   Adjust your campaign’s [location settings](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722043) to target allowed locations.
    
*   Try [comparing your location targeting options](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722038#compare) to find the one that works for you. For example, if you don't want your ads to show to people outside your targeted locations, make sure to target **People in your targeted locations** under your campaign’s "Locations" settings.
    

You can always choose to [pause the ad](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375285) while you take the steps necessary to fix your ad.

Reports of illegal content to Google
------------------------------------

If you believe that content on any Google product violates the law or your rights, you can submit a request to have it removed. Learn more about how to [Report Content for Legal Reasons](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420).

If your ads are disapproved as a result of this process, you can submit an appeal through the legal appeal form sent to you by email or in-product notification.

As part of Google's transparency efforts, a copy of each legal request we receive may be sent to [Lumen](https://lumendatabase.org/pages/about) for publication. You can find information on complaints made against your ads on [Lumen](https://www.lumendatabase.org/) by searching the relevant Ads URL.

As an advertiser, you can reach out to [Google Ads Support](https://support.google.com/google-ads/gethelp) if you have other questions about legal removal requests. Advertisers are encouraged to resolve this matter directly with the claimant who submitted the legal notice.
