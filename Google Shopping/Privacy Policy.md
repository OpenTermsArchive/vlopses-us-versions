(a)Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited towards Customer; and

(b)Customer towards Google, Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited, under or in connection with the Agreement and the Controller SCCs combined will be subject to Section 5 (Liability). Clause 12 of the Controller SCCs will not affect the previous sentence.

7.Third-Party Beneficiaries

Where Google LLC and/or Google Ireland Limited are not a party to the Agreement but are a party to the applicable Controller SCCs in accordance with paragraph 5 (Controller SCCs) of this Appendix 1A, Google LLC and/or Google Ireland Limited (as applicable) will be a third-party beneficiary of Section 4.3 (End Controllers) and paragraphs 3 (Google End Controllers), 5 (Controller SCCs) and 6 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply) of this Appendix 1A.

8.2**Additional Commercial Clauses**. Subject to the amendments in these Controller Terms, the Agreement remains in full force and effect. Paragraphs 5.5 (Contacting Google) to 5.7 (Data Deletion on Termination), and paragraph 6 (Liability if Controller SCCs Apply) of this Appendix 1A are additional commercial clauses relating to the Controller SCCs as permitted by Clause 2(a) (Effect and invariability of the Clauses) of the Controller SCCs.

8.3**No Modification of Controller SCCs**. Nothing in the Agreement (including these Controller Terms) is intended to modify or contradict any Controller SCCs or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects under the European Data Protection Legislation.

(a) respond directly to the data subject’s request in accordance with the standard functionality of a tool (if any) made available by a Google Entity to data subjects that enables Google to respond directly and in a standardized manner to certain requests from data subjects in relation to Customer Personal Data (for example, online advertising settings or an opt-out browser plugin) (“**Data Subject Tool**”) (if the request is made via a Data Subject Tool); or

(b) advise the data subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to such request (if the request is not made via a Data Subject Tool).

3.5.2**Google’s Data Subject Request Assistance.** Google will assist Customer in fulfilling its (or, where Customer is a processor, the relevant controller’s) obligations under the US State Privacy Laws to respond to requests for exercising the data subject’s rights, in all cases taking into account the nature of the processing of Customer Personal Data and by:

(a) providing the functionality of the RDP Services;

Transparency and privacy
========================

If you believe a Google Customer Reviews participant is in violation of one of the policies below, please let us know by filling out the [Google Customer Reviews report violation form](https://support.google.com/merchants/contact/gcr_report_violation?previewKey=5005707) so we can investigate. We take action on content and products that violate our policies. This may include disapproving violating content or product, as well as issuing warnings or suspending accounts for repeated or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously.

False and misleading representation
-----------------------------------

Google Customer Reviews doesn’t allow its participants to display content that misrepresents a product, offering, or material fact. A Google Customer Reviews participant is not allowed to provide an inaccurate product or offering description or knowingly omit any material details of a product or offering. This applies to all product features including but not limited to quality, value, price, or history of the good.

Google doesn’t allow merchants to falsely represent other merchants or organizations.

Implied affiliation
-------------------

Google Customer Reviews doesn't allow content that implies an affiliation, partnership, or any special relationship with Google without explicit authorization from Google. Participants will not issue any press release, announcements, or other promotional materials related to their participation in Google Customer Reviews without Google’s prior approval. Please direct all requests for such approval to press@google.com. Additionally, participants can't imply an affiliation, partnership, or any special relationship with any unrelated third party.

Information harvesting
----------------------

Google Customer Reviews doesn't allow websites whose primary purpose is to collect personal information. This includes but is not limited to websites offering free gifts or other incentives in exchange for personal information. We refer to this practice as "information harvesting". Examples of free gifts or incentives include: prizes, offers, videos, eBooks, and quiz/survey results.

Websites that are not harvesting information from users, but collect sensitive personal information (such as bank details and credit card numbers), must use a secure processing server (https://) when collecting this information.

Participants remain responsible for ensuring that they are compliant with local laws and regulations on the subject of privacy and data protection. Google may suspend any account or campaign found to be in violation of our policy or the law.

Software principles
-------------------

Google Customer Reviews doesn't allow websites that distribute harmful or disruptive software onto users' machines. Additionally, Google doesn't allow websites that are misleading or deceptive about the nature of distributed downloads.

This policy is shaped by our corporate [Software Principles](http://www.google.com/about/company/software-principles.html):

*   Installation - We believe software shouldn't trick you into installing it.
*   Upfront disclosure - When an application is installed or enabled, it should inform you of its principal and significant functions.
*   Simple removal - It should be easy for you to figure out how to disable or delete an application.
*   Clear behavior - Applications that affect or change your user experience should make it clear that they're the reason for those changes.
*   Snooping - If an application collects or transmits your personal information such as your address, you should know.
*   Keeping good company - Application providers shouldn't allow their products to be bundled with applications that don't meet these guidelines.

Some applications may not be malicious in their intent, but are designed to bundle applications, transmit user information, or change computer settings without explicit user acknowledgement. This type of software is considered harmful for the user because it may steal personal and financial information, is typically not easy to uninstall or remove, may change browser settings, and may transmit data to and from other external entities without the user's consent.

Participant privacy practices
-----------------------------

Participants must post a privacy policy which accurately discloses their practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information, including personally-identifiable information.

Participants should include the following information in their privacy policies:

*   Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve the badge on your website and to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website
*   Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/). Alternatively you can point users who wish to opt out of a third party vendor's use of cookies for interest-based advertising to the [Network Advertising Initiative opt out page](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).

Because seller sites and laws across countries/territories vary, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language. However, you may wish to review resources such as the [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) for guidance on drafting a privacy policy.

Personal information
--------------------

Sellers must provide a secure way for customers to purchase products online and systems are expected to follow best practices for privacy and security. If your website collects sensitive personal information, your site must be hosted on a secure server that uses SSL (https). The following information is all considered to be sensitive personal information.

*   Credit and debit card numbers
*   Bank and investment account numbers
*   Checking account numbers
*   Wire transfer numbers
*   National identity, pension, social security, or health care numbers
*   Any other information which is defined as sensitive personal data/information under applicable law

For any page of your website that collects and stores sensitive personal information, your site must be hosted on a secure server that uses SSL (https). In addition, participants must clearly post their terms for opting-in and opting-out of saving payment instruments for future purchases, as applicable.

Advertising
===========

Advertising keeps Google and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Google, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.

Google advertising services are experimenting with new ways of supporting the delivery and measurement of digital advertising in ways that better protect people’s privacy online via the [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) initiative on Chrome and Android. Users with the relevant Privacy Sandbox settings enabled in Chrome or Android may see relevant ads from Google’s advertising services based on [Topics](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/topics/overview/) or [Protected Audience](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/protected-audience/) data stored on their browser or mobile device. Google’s advertising services may also measure ad performance using [Attribution Reporting](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/attribution-reporting/) data stored on their browser or mobile device. [More information on the Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/).

How Google uses cookies in advertising
--------------------------------------

Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.

Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Google to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on websites you have visited).

We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These [server logs](https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms#toc-terms-server-logs) typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or, if you are signed-in, that may uniquely identify you. We store this data for a number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months).

### Our advertising cookies

To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer many products, including AdSense, AdWords, Google Analytics, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these products, either on Google services or on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.

These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from their domains.

See more detail about the [types of cookies used by Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies#types-of-cookies) and our partners and [how we use them](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies).

### How you can control advertising cookies

You can use [ad settings](https://myadcenter.google.com/?ref=privacy-policy) to manage the Google ads you see and turn off personalized ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as your general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and your search terms.

You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based [aboutads.info choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) page or the EU-based [Your Online Choices](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices).

Finally, you can [manage cookies in your web browser](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies#types-of-cookies).

Other technologies used in advertising
--------------------------------------

Google’s advertising systems may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats. We may use the [IP address](https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms#toc-terms-ip), for example, to identify your general location, to measure the effectiveness of ads, and, depending on your settings, to improve the relevance of the ads you see. When using information to measure the effectiveness of ads, we may infer whether activity from different devices or accounts is associated. We may also select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as the time and date, your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.

#### Location

Google’s ad products may receive or infer information about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your search queries; we may use your declared home or work address; and websites or apps that you use may send information about your location to us. Google uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertisers.

### Advertising identifiers for mobile apps

To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.

Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:

*   **Reset your device’s advertising ID**, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
*   **Delete your device’s advertising ID**, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.

To make changes to the advertising ID on your Android device, follow the instructions below.

#### Android

##### Reset your device’s advertising ID

To reset your device’s advertising ID:

1.  On your Android device, go to **Settings**.
2.  Tap **Privacy** > **Ads**.
3.  Tap **Reset advertising ID** and confirm your changes.

##### Delete your device’s advertising ID

To delete your device’s advertising ID:

1.  On your Android device, go to **Settings**.
2.  Tap **Privacy** > **Ads**.
3.  Tap **Delete advertising ID** and confirm your changes.

Your advertising ID will be reset or deleted, but apps may have their own settings using other types of identifiers, which can also affect the types of ads you see.

##### On some older versions of Android

If your Android device’s version is 4.4 or older:

1.  Open **Settings**
2.  Tap **Privacy** > **Advanced** > **Ads**
3.  Turn on **Opt out of Ads Personalization** and confirm your changes.

#### iOS

Devices with iOS use Apple’s Advertising Identifier. To learn more about your choices for use of this identifier, visit the **Settings** app on your device.

#### Connected TV/Over-the-Top

##### Advertising identifiers for connected TV

Connected TVs are another area where cookie technology is not available, and, instead, Google will rely on device identifiers designed for use in advertising to serve ads. Many connected TV devices support an identifier for advertising that is similar in function to mobile device identifiers. These identifiers are built to give users the option to reset them or to opt out of personalized advertising entirely.

The following “Ads” settings are available on TVs with the following consistent language:

*   Reset advertising ID
*   Delete advertising ID
*   Opt out of Ads Personalization (on or off)
*   Ads by Google (links to About Google ad personalization)
*   Your advertising ID (long string)

These Ads settings are available in the following paths on Google TV and Android TV respectively.

**Google TV**

Consistent path to Ads:

1.  Settings
2.  Privacy
3.  Ads

**Android TV**

Ads settings show up in one of two general paths for Android TV depending on the TV manufacturer/model. In Android TV, partners have the freedom to adapt the Settings path. It’s up to the partner which path they use to best fit their custom TV experience but below are the common paths to Ad settings.

Path A:

1.  Settings
2.  About
3.  Legal Information
4.  Ads

Path B:

1.  Settings
2.  Devices Preferences
3.  About
4.  Legal Information
5.  Ads

##### Non-Google Devices

Many connected TV devices support identifiers for advertising and offer ways for users to opt out of personalized advertising. A full list of those devices, and ways users can opt out, is kept updated on the Network Advertising Initiative’s website here: [https://thenai.org/opt-out/connected-tv-choices/](https://thenai.org/opt-out/connected-tv-choices/).

#### What determines the ads by Google that I see?

Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.

Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for ‘pizza’ might return results for pizza places in your town.

Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening equipment.

Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app activity or activity on Google services; an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another device.

Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Google but selected by another company. For example, you might have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use Google’s ad serving products to deliver those ads.

The ad you see on a household device, such as a connected TV (such as a Smart TV), may be related to the web or app activity from devices within the same household.

You may also see ads on Google products and services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Google.

#### Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?

You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to return and complete your purchase. Google offers services that let website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.

For this to work, Google either reads a cookie that’s already in your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).

When you visit another site that works with Google, which may have nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs. That’s because your browser sends Google the same cookie. In turn, we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to buy those golf clubs.

Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by Google to show you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on Google.

We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, such as health information or religious beliefs.

The Receiving Controller will ensure that such measures provide a level of security reasonable to the risk represented by the Processing and the nature of the data to be protected including:

(b) Security Incident Response; Statements. Where required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Receiving Controller will promptly inform the Disclosing Controller of a security incident or data protection breach concerning Personal Information. Except as required by law, the Receiving Controller will not make (or permit any Third-Party Provider under its control to make) any statement concerning the security incident that directly or indirectly references the Disclosing Controller unless the Disclosing Controller provides its written authorization.

(c) Third-Party Providers. The Receiving Controller will contractually require each Third-Party Provider that Processes Personal Information to protect the privacy, confidentiality, and security of Personal Information using all reasonable measures as required by this PIPA and Applicable Data Protection Laws.

If Disclosing Controller reasonably believes that Receiving Controller is engaged in unauthorized processing of the Personal Information, Disclosing Controller will immediately notify Receiving Controller of such belief, and the parties will work together in good faith to remediate the allegedly violative processing activities, if necessary.

6. End Controller.

(i) The parties acknowledge that LGPD allows the international transfer of Personal Information in accordance with a Data Transfer Solution, as provided by the LGPD and its regulation and agree that such a transfer does not violate the terms of this PIPA or the Agreement.

(ii) Where a Data Transfer Solution does not apply, the parties expressly agree to the Brazilian Controller-Controller SCCs including the warranties and undertakings contained therein as the “exporter” and “importer” as applicable to the transfer of Personal Information contemplated by the parties. Nothing in the Agreement or in the PIPA is intended to modify or contradict the Brazilian Controller-Controller SCCs. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Brazilian Controller-Controller SCCs and the Agreement or the PIPA, the Brazilian Controller-Controller SCCs will prevail.

8. Termination.
---------------

In addition to the suspension and termination rights in the Agreement, either party may terminate the Agreement or an applicable SOW if it reasonably determines that (a) the other party has failed to cure material noncompliance with the PIPA within a reasonable time; or (b) it needs to do so to comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws.

9. Survival.
------------

This PIPA will survive expiration or termination of the Agreement as long as the parties continue to Process the other party’s Personal Information.
