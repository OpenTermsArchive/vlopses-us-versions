Google Maps Platform Acceptable Use Policy
==========================================

Use of the Google Maps Platform Services are subject to this Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”).

This AUP is designed to ensure that your use of the Services does not place Google’s Products or Services at risk, endanger end users, or degrade the public’s trust. In order to assist with interpretation of the AUP, we have created a [Help Center](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/aup/help-center) which aims to clarify the prohibited uses of the Services, and provides illustrative (non-exhaustive) examples to guide developers as they build the next generation of applications. 

Capitalized terms have the meaning stated in the applicable agreement between Customer and Google.

The decision as to whether any particular use case violates the AUP shall be determined by Google in its sole discretion.

Customer agrees not to, and not to allow third parties (either directly or indirectly) to, use the Services:

*   to engage in, promote, facilitate, or encourage unlawful, illegal, or infringing activity, including infringement of intellectual property rights;
*   for any misleading or fraudulent purpose, or to impersonate others;
*   to facilitate or promote dangerous activities, threaten serious physical injury or death, promote hatred or violence against others, or rally support to physically harm others;
*   for any Customer Applications related to sexually explicit content or services;
*   to create, upload, distribute (or not taking action to prohibit others from creating, uploading, or distributing) content that facilitates the exploitation, endangerment, or abuse of children;
*   for activities that, or are intended to, disparage, discriminate, defame, extort, or harass;
*   for any Customer Application that violates, impedes, or may interfere with privacy rights;
*   to limit access to “sensitive consumer opportunities” based on demographics;
*   to, without user consent, combine any personal information held by the Customer with any Google data to derive additional personal information;
*   to assist in the offensive use of weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people;
*   to distribute items of a destructive or deceptive nature;

*   to generate, distribute, publish, or facilitate unsolicited mass email, promotions, advertisements, or other solicitations (“spam”); 
*   to use the Services, or any interfaces provided with the Services, to access any other Google product or service in a manner that violates the terms of service or applicable policies of such other Google product or service, or to use the Services to circumvent the terms of service or policies of any other Google product or service;
*   in Customer Applications directed to children (Customer will not use the Google Maps Core Services in a Customer Application that would be deemed to be a “Web site or online service directed to children” under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA));
*   for materials or activities that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State; or
*   to transmit, store, or process health information subject to United States HIPAA regulations (“HIPAA” means the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as it may be amended, and any regulations issued under it).
