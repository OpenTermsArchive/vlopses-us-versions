Display ads performance standards
---------------------------------

This section describes the methodology, metrics, and standards Microsoft uses to assess the performance of display ads, where ad performance in this context refers to the weight or heaviness of an ad. The standards documented below are in alignment with the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) published in July 2017. Ads that do not comply with the performance standards outlined below will be prohibited from displaying on Microsoft online properties.

**Background: Why display ad performance is important**

Better ad performance is a win-win for ad providers and publishers. Said another way:

*   Poor ad performance impacts publishers' business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance impacts ad business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance contributes to the use of ad blockers.

This section describes each of the three performance metrics in more detail, including the thresholds used for flagging heavy ads.

1\. Total bytes — The total number of bytes (KB) downloaded over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, analytics calls, etc. Total Bytes thresholds are clearly defined in the Microsoft Display ad specs and shown below.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes threshold | The combination of Initial and Subload (Polite) cannot exceed the KB limits defined in this document.  <br>  <br>User initiated content is not factored into the size measurement.  <br>  <br>If the ad contains a video element, this size is separately considered and not calculated in the Banner KB size. | Identical. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551)  <br>  <br>Banner MAX Combined Size  <br>300 x 250 - 450 KB  <br>728 x 90 - 450 KB  <br>300 x 600 - 600 KB  <br>970 x 250 - 750 KB  <br>  <br>Video Max Size  <br>1.1MB |

2\. Total requests — The total number of HTTP requests over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, pixels, event beacons, etc.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests threshold | The sum of all HTTP Requests made by an ad which include calls for ad assets, pixels, event beacons, etc. cannot exceed 100.  <br>  <br>Note that DSP's and Ad Networks may add additional HTTP requests to an ad which are included in this threshold. | Maximum number of initial load file requests is 10. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551).  <br>  <br>_Note_: Microsoft has found that 10 is quite strict when considering all pixels, beacons, etc. that are commonly included with the ad and/or added by DSPs. 1.1MB |

3\. CPU — The amount of CPU consumed by the main browser thread over a 30s period when the ad is loaded. A common cause of excessive CPU is JavaScript code/libraries. Because it's impossible to represent CPU performance across the full spectrum of user machines, we take a conservative approach and choose a threshold that errs on the lenient side.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU threshold | An ad should not impose more than an average of 30% CPU utilization during the first 30s when the ad is loaded. This translates to a total of 12s of CPU consumed on a PC with average CPU power. | 30% CPU load max (based on the average CPU of the user base) per active ad. Please refer to the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) for additional information. |

##### Important

Since September 2020, Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge has introduced a new [browser intervention](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262194) that monitors ad iframes and may redirect them to an error page (Heavy ad intervention) if resource use exceeds specified criteria. Video advertisements, in particular, may be more vulnerable to this intervention, which impacts iframes that load more than 4 MB of data.  
  
If a creative satisfies any of the following criteria, it is considered heavy:

*   The main thread is used for more than 60 seconds in total.
*   In any 30 second window, the main thread is used for more than 15 seconds.
*   More than 4 MB of network bandwidth is consumed It is recommended that the creative is compliant with the technical specifications detailed above.

Microsoft Audience Network
--------------------------

**Overview**

Microsoft Audience Ads allow you to immerse your brand within publisher sites to reach the right audience, at the right time, within the right context. This winning combination drives engagement, click-through rate (CTR), cost per acquisition (CPA), and more to enhance your campaign performance.

Getting started is simple.

*   For image-based ads: Upload an image, copy, and URL. Microsoft Advertising will format your content to match the unique look and feel of the publisher site, whether it's displayed on a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.
*   For Video & Connected TV ads: Upload your video creative, adhering to our video quality ratings that are outlined below. The quality of your video will determine where your ads can serve—the higher the video quality, the more premium placements you'll be able to access. Note, Video & Connected TV ads are currently in open beta; so, they may not be available yet to all advertisers. Get in touch with your account team to know more.

**Image-based ad deliverables**

| Ad components | File type | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Image | JPEG or PNG | Recommended: 1200 x 628 or higher.  <br>Minimum: 703 x 368 |
| Short headline | Text | 40 characters max |

| Ad text | Text | 90 characters max |
| Business name | Text | 25 characters max |
| URL | Text | 1024 characters max |
| Mobile URL | Text | 1024 characters max |

**Creative best practices for audience ads**

*   Images are recommended to have no text or logo overlay for maximum flexibility.
*   Some publishers prohibit the use of embedded text within images.
*   Images can be cropped or used with headline overlays, which can result in issues if the image is text heavy.
*   If text is required (e.g., legally required/logo issues):
    *   Consider moving the text to the headlines instead of including in the image.
    *   Use fewer words.
    *   Use smaller font size.
    *   Keep text centered.
    *   Be sure to leverage the preview tool in the UI.
*   Before submitting, ensure images and text look as expected in all ad preview formats using the preview tool in the UI and ensure that there's no text overlay.
*   The image must be clearly relevant to the product or service being advertised.
*   Image assets used for Audience Ads share the same dimensions as Google Display Network, Meta Audience Network, and Yahoo Gemini.

**Safe area**

Publishers place "sponsored" or "ad" icons typically near the bottom of the image along with the headline and business name text. This should be considered when choosing image content.

Audience ads allow individual image cropping to support all aspect ratios for each ad experience. Using the preview tool is important to validate each ad experience. If your ad isn't showing as expected in each aspect ratio, you can re-crop it.

**Ad variants**

_Audience Network wide image (1:91:1)_  

_Microsoft Edge single carousel (1:78:1)_  

_MSN in-article ad (1.5:1)_  

_MSN small headline (1.33:1)_  

_Audience Network square image (1:1)_  

_Outlook.com web desktop (text)_  

_Outlook.com mobile web (text)_  

**Example**

_MSN homepage PC web_

**Video-based ad deliverables**

With Video & Connected TV ads, advertisers can reach their audience across a wide range of online Video and Connected TV inventory. To access more premium online video and CTV inventory, advertisers need to upload higher quality assets.

Video assets are categorized in three ways: Good Quality, Excellent Quality, and Perfect Quality.

Once you upload your videos to Microsoft Advertising, the system will determine which quality standards your video meets using a three-star rating—with three stars being the highest.

Use the below guidelines to understand what the requirements are for each of the different video qualities. If you wish to advertise on our most premium inventory, ensure that your video meets the Excellent Quality requirements.

With Video & Connected TV ads, advertisers can reach their audience across a wide range of online Video and Connected TV inventory. To access more premium online video and CTV inventory, advertisers need to upload higher quality assets.

Video assets are categorized in three ways:

*   Good Quality
*   Excellent Quality
*   Perfect Quality

Once you upload your videos to Microsoft Advertising, the system will determine which quality standards your video meets using a three-star rating, with three stars being the highest.

Use the below guidelines to understand what the requirements are for each of the different video qualities. If you wish to advertise on our most premium inventory, ensure that your video meets the excellent quality requirements.

*   Click to video only.
*   Key art assets (i.e. Layered PSD, AI, EPS, illustrations, photos, fonts) are needed for our design team to build out static banners, video banner overlays, and landing experience branded pages.

**Third-party ad served video (VAST)**

This specification covers linear video ad formats that are third-party served (ad is delivered via [IAB's Video Ad Serving Template (VAST)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262195)).

All third-party ad servers must meet the below requirements:

*   Vendor certification is required for each IAB standard and version. Work with your account team representative to verify certification or request certification for new vendors.
*   Third-party served VAST tags are required to return an ad each time the tag is called. Ad tags provided by agencies/advertisers or their contracted vendors should not restrict ad responses based on upstream or buy side targeting or capping. Publisher targeting will be enforced at the time of booking per the IO contract. This includes, but is not limited to: GEO targeting, Audience or BT targeting, frequency capping, Dayparting, etc… Furthermore, ad tags provided on a specific advertiser/brand IO contract should not rotate in ads from advertisers or brands not covered on the IO contract.  
    The following scenarios are deemed acceptable occasions when the ad may not return or may change its ad response: Ad tag is outside the agreed upon flight dates; ad is rotating between multiple ad creatives for the same brand. Note that while ad rotation is supported, all ads returned must comply with all Microsoft Advertising policies.
*   Inline ad responses are expected to provide only one (1) ad per VAST ad call. Tags may rotate the response upon refresh but may not provide more than one ad element within the XML document.
*   The duration node must be formatted as HH:MM:SS per the IAB specification. Furthermore, the duration node should represent the ad unit length (or expected ad unit length if unknown at time of VAST rendering) — it is not permitted to return a duration of 00:00:00 or 00:00:01.
*   Media files present in the ad response should provide the full range of supported frame sizes and bit rates, sorted in order of preference HD, Mobile HD, SD, Mobile SD (specifications as indicated in the above table). Please do not attempt to perform device/bandwidth detection to scope the available media files list; players will make the appropriate bit rate selection client-side.
*   Pop-up and pop-under windows are not supported on any product.

**VAST wrapper ads**

*   Ad tag tokens will not be evaluated at runtime by the player. The VAST ad tag URL should be returned fully decorated by the ad server returning the wrapper ad response. This includes but is not limited to cache busting tokens.
*   The maximum number of chained wrappers supported is currently 3 with the 4th tag expected to provide an inline ad response. Chains longer than this number cannot be guaranteed for delivery or reporting accuracy.
*   Per the IAB specification, the wrapper ad tags may provide tracking events only, no additional assets may be delivered through the wrapper payload. This includes but is not limited to: ad parameters, or media files.

**Linear VPAID**

*   Ad selector
    *   Ad selectors must time out and select a default ad if no user interaction is detected. Furthermore, ad selector timeouts will count toward the maximum duration specified above and the sum of the timeout and the ad video may not exceed the max duration.
*   Countdown/time remaining
    *   The MSN player will provide a countdown to the user to indicate the time until the ad completes. VPAID ads must implement the adRemainingTime property and adRemainingTimeChange event to indicate changes to the player to ensure that the countdown is accurate and to avoid unexpected timeouts within the player from prematurely unloading the ad experience.
    *   Ads are discouraged from presenting their own countdown UI to avoid a poor user experience of displaying redundant information.
    *   Ads should similarly not force their content to the top -most z-index to hide the countdown and mini- control bar; this action will be periodically detected, and MSFT may opt to pull ads exhibiting this behavior.
*   Error Handling
    *   Per the IAB specification, all errors within the ad must not be raised to the player unless communicated through the adError event.
    *   Furthermore, ad errors encountered during specific IAB events (AdImpression, AdVideoStart, AdVideoFirstQuartile, AdVideoMidpoint, AdVideoThirdQuartile, AdVid eoComplete) should not prevent the player from receiving these events (for example, if the ad is detecting user behavior during these events and has an internal failure, the ad is still required to notify the player of the IAB events for proper tracking and metrics — ads failing to report properly may be pulled).
*   Expansion/interactive ad experience
*   Ads may enter into an interactive state (video is paused, and interactive content is shown in the player window) or an expanded state (ad content has exceeded the standard max duration at the user's explicit request for more information).
*   Entrance: Accessible only on click of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area or on hover of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area with a minimum 5 seconds of hover time and visible indicator of the impending action as the user is hovering (i.e. progress bar, decreasing clock wedge, numerical countdown, etc.)
*   Exit: Exit button must be clearly displayed and distinguished in the top-right hand corner of the video frame, with the smallest edge not smaller than 32px. Ads failing to comply with this requirement will be pulled or blocked from launch and vendors will be placed on certification review.
*   Z-index
    *   No z-index should be set by the ad. If one is required, the z-index value cannot exceed 100.
*   Leave behind content.
    *   Linear VPAID ads may not leave behind any content after the ad video completes. Once the ad completes, the VPAID ad will be unloaded, and all visual and non-visual objects must be removed and disposed.
*   Max Duration
    *   30s unless user explicitly chooses to enter into an interactive ad experience (see below for restrictions).
*   Resizing
    *   Ads must respond when the resizeAd() method is invoked; while a 16x9 ratio is expected, it is not guaranteed, therefore ads should scale their content appropriately and not rigidly adhere to one display ratio. Ads should immediately resize, when instructed, to avoid a poor user experience and to reduce display flicker.
*   Video click-through
    *   Ads can opt to process video click events on interactive elements as they see fit; however, the following requirements must be followed for standard video click-thrus and for any navigation to pages outside of the player window:
        *   If the video playback pauses on click, the ad must render a resume button over the video content so that the user can resume the ad and reach the content experience.
        *   The VPAID AdClickThru event must be raised for video click-thrus. If the ad opts to handle the click thru directly, the destination page must open in a new (non-modal) tab/window and must not replace the current window/frame.

_IAB VPAID 2.0 support limitations_

*   Only VAST 3.0 delivery is supported at this time (see related linear video spec for more details), it is important to note that skip functionality is not supported within the player. Therefore, if skip functionality is desired VPAID 2.0 should be used.

_VPAID vendor certification_

All VPAID vendors must submit test assets for certification prior for running VPAID ads on Microsoft Advertising properties. Please work with your account team representative to submit for VPAID vendor certification. VPAID vendors are expected to VAST deliver their VPAID ad content. If the VPAID vendor will also serve linear video through the same ad server to Microsoft Advertising, they should submit for both VAST and VPAID vendor certification. Otherwise, if the VAST payload is mostly static and does not vary by advertiser, only VPAID certification is required.

_VPAID Interface Requirements_

*   All functions and properties on the VPAID object interface MUST be present even if their return values are NULL or methods are not implemented.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the initAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the startAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must update the adRemainingTime property with the actual duration of the ad or clearly indicating an unknown value within the first second after the video start event.
*   AdStarted event and AdImpression event must fire as simultaneously as possible.

_Cross-domain data request_

Vendor ad servers, CDNs, and all server-side resources referenced in the VAST tag and VPAID ad must allow Microsoft & Microsoft partner domains (\*msn.com; \*.fwmrm.net; \*.s-msn.com) to access cross-site data via the following method:

*   CORS HTTP Headers: Server response headers must contain 'allow origin' CORS HTTP headers as documented at: http://www.w3.org/TR/access -control/#access-control-al low-origin-response-header. Allow origin headers can reply with a wild card or by echoing the source origin. Please refer to the w3 documentation for details on the benefits/risks for both options.
    *   Example CORS response header:  
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*

**Other third-party served ad policies**

_Discrepancy rates between ad servers_

Microsoft does not provide guarantees relating to 3rd party served discrepancies but will commit to investigate discrepancies that exceed accepted industry standard discrepancy rates.

_Server-to-server ad calls_

Microsoft does not currently employ server-to-server ad calls for vendor ad tags. Furthermore, it is strongly preferred that Microsoft provided ad tags for third-party sourced inventory are called directly from the client, however, server-to-server ad calls can be supported provided the following attributes are communicated to the MSFT ad server on the ad call (work with your account team to get specific query-string parameters for these attributes).

*   Client IP address
*   User agent

_Max tracking pixels per event_

While no hard limit is enforced on the MSFT properties, the maximum recommended number of tracking pixels per event is set at five (5). This limit is proposed to reduce risk of latent or dropped event tracking and ensure discrepancy rates within industry norms.

**Metrics & reporting**

The following events are supported across the video product portfolio for first-party and third-party served ads.

_Video events_

*   Play (impression)
*   Video click
*   First quartile
*   Midpoint
*   Third quartile
*   Complete
*   Pause
*   Mute
*   Unmute
*   Close

Display ads performance standards
---------------------------------

This section describes the methodology, metrics, and standards Microsoft uses to assess the performance of display ads, where ad performance in this context refers to the weight or heaviness of an ad. The standards documented below are in alignment with the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) published in July 2017. Ads that do not comply with the performance standards outlined below will be prohibited from displaying on Microsoft online properties.

**Background: Why display ad performance is important**

Better ad performance is a win-win for ad providers and publishers. Said another way:

*   Poor ad performance impacts publishers' business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance impacts ad business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance contributes to the use of ad blockers.

This section describes each of the three performance metrics in more detail, including the thresholds used for flagging heavy ads.

1\. Total bytes — The total number of bytes (KB) downloaded over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, analytics calls, etc. Total Bytes thresholds are clearly defined in the Microsoft Display ad specs and shown below.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes threshold | The combination of Initial and Subload (Polite) cannot exceed the KB limits defined in this document.  <br>  <br>User initiated content is not factored into the size measurement.  <br>  <br>If the ad contains a video element, this size is separately considered and not calculated in the Banner KB size. | Identical. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551)  <br>  <br>Banner MAX Combined Size  <br>300 x 250 - 450 KB  <br>728 x 90 - 450 KB  <br>300 x 600 - 600 KB  <br>970 x 250 - 750 KB  <br>  <br>Video Max Size  <br>1.1MB |

2\. Total requests — The total number of HTTP requests over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, pixels, event beacons, etc.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests threshold | The sum of all HTTP Requests made by an ad which include calls for ad assets, pixels, event beacons, etc. cannot exceed 100.  <br>  <br>Note that DSP's and Ad Networks may add additional HTTP requests to an ad which are included in this threshold. | Maximum number of initial load file requests is 10. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551).  <br>  <br>_Note_: Microsoft has found that 10 is quite strict when considering all pixels, beacons, etc. that are commonly included with the ad and/or added by DSPs. 1.1MB |

3\. CPU — The amount of CPU consumed by the main browser thread over a 30s period when the ad is loaded. A common cause of excessive CPU is JavaScript code/libraries. Because it's impossible to represent CPU performance across the full spectrum of user machines, we take a conservative approach and choose a threshold that errs on the lenient side.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU threshold | An ad should not impose more than an average of 30% CPU utilization during the first 30s when the ad is loaded. This translates to a total of 12s of CPU consumed on a PC with average CPU power. | 30% CPU load max (based on the average CPU of the user base) per active ad. Please refer to the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) for additional information. |

##### Important

Since September 2020, Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge has introduced a new [browser intervention](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262194) that monitors ad iframes and may redirect them to an error page (Heavy ad intervention) if resource use exceeds specified criteria. Video advertisements, in particular, may be more vulnerable to this intervention, which impacts iframes that load more than 4 MB of data.  
  
If a creative satisfies any of the following criteria, it is considered heavy:

*   The main thread is used for more than 60 seconds in total.
*   In any 30 second window, the main thread is used for more than 15 seconds.
*   More than 4 MB of network bandwidth is consumed It is recommended that the creative is compliant with the technical specifications detailed above.

**Image-based ad deliverables**

| Ad text | Text | 90 characters max |
| Business name | Text | 25 characters max |
| URL | Text | 1024 characters max |

**Creative best practices for audience ads**

*   Images are recommended to have no text or logo overlay for maximum flexibility.
*   Some publishers prohibit the use of embedded text within images.
*   Images can be cropped or used with headline overlays, which can result in issues if the image is text heavy.
*   If text is required (e.g., legally required/logo issues):
    *   Consider moving the text to the headlines instead of including in the image.
    *   Use fewer words.
    *   Use smaller font size.
    *   Keep text centered.
    *   Be sure to leverage the preview tool in the UI.
*   Before submitting, ensure images and text look as expected in all ad preview formats using the preview tool in the UI and ensure that there's no text overlay.
*   The image must be clearly relevant to the product or service being advertised.
*   Image assets used for Audience Ads share the same dimensions as Google Display Network, Meta Audience Network, and Yahoo Gemini.

**Safe area**

Publishers place "sponsored" or "ad" icons typically near the bottom of the image along with the headline and business name text. This should be considered when choosing image content.

Audience ads allow individual image cropping to support all aspect ratios for each ad experience. Using the preview tool is important to validate each ad experience. If your ad isn't showing as expected in each aspect ratio, you can re-crop it.

**Ad variants**

_Audience Network wide image (1:91:1)_  

_Microsoft Edge single carousel (1:78:1)_  

_MSN in-article ad (1.5:1)_  

_MSN small headline (1.33:1)_  

_Audience Network square image (1:1)_  

_Outlook.com web desktop (text)_  

_Outlook.com mobile web (text)_  

**Example**

_MSN homepage PC web_

    *   User choice: User may opt to view ad and/or content in full screen mode. Application code may not trigger this state without explicit user consent.
*   Ad Skipping
    *   VPAID app: VPAID ad may opt to show skip ad option. Player will not present ad skipping to the user.
*   Video Click Area
    *   Area within player where click events are available to trigger a click-through or other interactive activity.
    *   VPAID app: Ad controls click area within the available display area.
*   Player controls (controls presented to user during ad experience playback)
    *   Full: Full range of controls are presented as a lower 1/3 frame overlay that appears on mouse over or tap on the player area (controls include: play/pause, mute, volume control and possibly more)
    *   Reduced: Video player controls are reduced to only play/pause and mute controls presented in top & bottom frame slim, permanent overlays to avoid player UI overlap with "bug" or other interactive elements.
*   Display area: Area within player which is available to the VPAID ad.
    *   Full: Full frame of player is available _Note_: Player's controls presented as overlays are not deducted from the display area. Ads should take this padding into consideration when certifying ad formats on MSN.
    *   Reduced: Video player will reduce the player display area to accommodate for persistent player controls. VPAID ads will be made aware of the available area through the initAd() and resizeAd() method calls.

_Xbox_

*   Xbox video ads are site-served only.
*   Click to video only.
*   Key art assets (i.e. Layered PSD, AI, EPS, illustrations, photos, fonts) are needed for our design team to build out static banners, video banner overlays, and landing experience branded pages.

**Third-party ad served video (VAST)**

This specification covers linear video ad formats that are third-party served (ad is delivered via [IAB's Video Ad Serving Template (VAST)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262195)).

All third-party ad servers must meet the below requirements:

*   Vendor certification is required for each IAB standard and version. Work with your account team representative to verify certification or request certification for new vendors.
*   Third-party served VAST tags are required to return an ad each time the tag is called. Ad tags provided by agencies/advertisers or their contracted vendors should not restrict ad responses based on upstream or buy side targeting or capping. Publisher targeting will be enforced at the time of booking per the IO contract. This includes, but is not limited to: GEO targeting, Audience or BT targeting, frequency capping, Dayparting, etc… Furthermore, ad tags provided on a specific advertiser/brand IO contract should not rotate in ads from advertisers or brands not covered on the IO contract.  
    The following scenarios are deemed acceptable occasions when the ad may not return or may change its ad response: Ad tag is outside the agreed upon flight dates; ad is rotating between multiple ad creatives for the same brand. Note that while ad rotation is supported, all ads returned must comply with all Microsoft Advertising policies.
*   Inline ad responses are expected to provide only one (1) ad per VAST ad call. Tags may rotate the response upon refresh but may not provide more than one ad element within the XML document.
*   The duration node must be formatted as HH:MM:SS per the IAB specification. Furthermore, the duration node should represent the ad unit length (or expected ad unit length if unknown at time of VAST rendering) — it is not permitted to return a duration of 00:00:00 or 00:00:01.
*   Media files present in the ad response should provide the full range of supported frame sizes and bit rates, sorted in order of preference HD, Mobile HD, SD, Mobile SD (specifications as indicated in the above table). Please do not attempt to perform device/bandwidth detection to scope the available media files list; players will make the appropriate bit rate selection client-side.
*   Pop-up and pop-under windows are not supported on any product.

**VAST wrapper ads**

*   Ad tag tokens will not be evaluated at runtime by the player. The VAST ad tag URL should be returned fully decorated by the ad server returning the wrapper ad response. This includes but is not limited to cache busting tokens.
*   The maximum number of chained wrappers supported is currently 3 with the 4th tag expected to provide an inline ad response. Chains longer than this number cannot be guaranteed for delivery or reporting accuracy.
*   Per the IAB specification, the wrapper ad tags may provide tracking events only, no additional assets may be delivered through the wrapper payload. This includes but is not limited to: ad parameters, or media files.

**Linear VPAID**

*   Ad selector
    *   Ad selectors must time out and select a default ad if no user interaction is detected. Furthermore, ad selector timeouts will count toward the maximum duration specified above and the sum of the timeout and the ad video may not exceed the max duration.
*   Countdown/time remaining
    *   The MSN player will provide a countdown to the user to indicate the time until the ad completes. VPAID ads must implement the adRemainingTime property and adRemainingTimeChange event to indicate changes to the player to ensure that the countdown is accurate and to avoid unexpected timeouts within the player from prematurely unloading the ad experience.
    *   Ads are discouraged from presenting their own countdown UI to avoid a poor user experience of displaying redundant information.
    *   Ads should similarly not force their content to the top -most z-index to hide the countdown and mini- control bar; this action will be periodically detected, and MSFT may opt to pull ads exhibiting this behavior.
*   Error Handling
    *   Per the IAB specification, all errors within the ad must not be raised to the player unless communicated through the adError event.
    *   Furthermore, ad errors encountered during specific IAB events (AdImpression, AdVideoStart, AdVideoFirstQuartile, AdVideoMidpoint, AdVideoThirdQuartile, AdVid eoComplete) should not prevent the player from receiving these events (for example, if the ad is detecting user behavior during these events and has an internal failure, the ad is still required to notify the player of the IAB events for proper tracking and metrics — ads failing to report properly may be pulled).
*   Expansion/interactive ad experience
*   Ads may enter into an interactive state (video is paused, and interactive content is shown in the player window) or an expanded state (ad content has exceeded the standard max duration at the user's explicit request for more information).
*   Entrance: Accessible only on click of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area or on hover of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area with a minimum 5 seconds of hover time and visible indicator of the impending action as the user is hovering (i.e. progress bar, decreasing clock wedge, numerical countdown, etc.)
*   Exit: Exit button must be clearly displayed and distinguished in the top-right hand corner of the video frame, with the smallest edge not smaller than 32px. Ads failing to comply with this requirement will be pulled or blocked from launch and vendors will be placed on certification review.
*   Z-index
    *   No z-index should be set by the ad. If one is required, the z-index value cannot exceed 100.
*   Leave behind content.
    *   Linear VPAID ads may not leave behind any content after the ad video completes. Once the ad completes, the VPAID ad will be unloaded, and all visual and non-visual objects must be removed and disposed.
*   Max Duration
    *   30s unless user explicitly chooses to enter into an interactive ad experience (see below for restrictions).
*   Resizing
    *   Ads must respond when the resizeAd() method is invoked; while a 16x9 ratio is expected, it is not guaranteed, therefore ads should scale their content appropriately and not rigidly adhere to one display ratio. Ads should immediately resize, when instructed, to avoid a poor user experience and to reduce display flicker.
*   Video click-through
    *   Ads can opt to process video click events on interactive elements as they see fit; however, the following requirements must be followed for standard video click-thrus and for any navigation to pages outside of the player window:
        *   If the video playback pauses on click, the ad must render a resume button over the video content so that the user can resume the ad and reach the content experience.
        *   The VPAID AdClickThru event must be raised for video click-thrus. If the ad opts to handle the click thru directly, the destination page must open in a new (non-modal) tab/window and must not replace the current window/frame.

_IAB VPAID 2.0 support limitations_

*   Only VAST 3.0 delivery is supported at this time (see related linear video spec for more details), it is important to note that skip functionality is not supported within the player. Therefore, if skip functionality is desired VPAID 2.0 should be used.

_VPAID vendor certification_

All VPAID vendors must submit test assets for certification prior for running VPAID ads on Microsoft Advertising properties. Please work with your account team representative to submit for VPAID vendor certification. VPAID vendors are expected to VAST deliver their VPAID ad content. If the VPAID vendor will also serve linear video through the same ad server to Microsoft Advertising, they should submit for both VAST and VPAID vendor certification. Otherwise, if the VAST payload is mostly static and does not vary by advertiser, only VPAID certification is required.

_VPAID Interface Requirements_

*   All functions and properties on the VPAID object interface MUST be present even if their return values are NULL or methods are not implemented.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the initAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the startAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must update the adRemainingTime property with the actual duration of the ad or clearly indicating an unknown value within the first second after the video start event.
*   AdStarted event and AdImpression event must fire as simultaneously as possible.

_Cross-domain data request_

Vendor ad servers, CDNs, and all server-side resources referenced in the VAST tag and VPAID ad must allow Microsoft & Microsoft partner domains (\*msn.com; \*.fwmrm.net; \*.s-msn.com) to access cross-site data via the following method:

*   CORS HTTP Headers: Server response headers must contain 'allow origin' CORS HTTP headers as documented at: http://www.w3.org/TR/access -control/#access-control-al low-origin-response-header. Allow origin headers can reply with a wild card or by echoing the source origin. Please refer to the w3 documentation for details on the benefits/risks for both options.
    *   Example CORS response header:  
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*

**Other third-party served ad policies**

_Discrepancy rates between ad servers_

Microsoft does not provide guarantees relating to 3rd party served discrepancies but will commit to investigate discrepancies that exceed accepted industry standard discrepancy rates.

_Server-to-server ad calls_

Microsoft does not currently employ server-to-server ad calls for vendor ad tags. Furthermore, it is strongly preferred that Microsoft provided ad tags for third-party sourced inventory are called directly from the client, however, server-to-server ad calls can be supported provided the following attributes are communicated to the MSFT ad server on the ad call (work with your account team to get specific query-string parameters for these attributes).

*   Client IP address
*   User agent

_Max tracking pixels per event_

While no hard limit is enforced on the MSFT properties, the maximum recommended number of tracking pixels per event is set at five (5). This limit is proposed to reduce risk of latent or dropped event tracking and ensure discrepancy rates within industry norms.

**Metrics & reporting**

The following events are supported across the video product portfolio for first-party and third-party served ads.

_Video events_

*   Play (impression)
*   Video click
*   First quartile
*   Midpoint
*   Third quartile
*   Complete
*   Pause
*   Mute
*   Unmute
*   Close

Display ads performance standards
---------------------------------

This section describes the methodology, metrics, and standards Microsoft uses to assess the performance of display ads, where ad performance in this context refers to the weight or heaviness of an ad. The standards documented below are in alignment with the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) published in July 2017. Ads that do not comply with the performance standards outlined below will be prohibited from displaying on Microsoft online properties.

**Background: Why display ad performance is important**

Better ad performance is a win-win for ad providers and publishers. Said another way:

*   Poor ad performance impacts publishers' business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance impacts ad business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance contributes to the use of ad blockers.

This section describes each of the three performance metrics in more detail, including the thresholds used for flagging heavy ads.

1\. Total bytes — The total number of bytes (KB) downloaded over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, analytics calls, etc. Total Bytes thresholds are clearly defined in the Microsoft Display ad specs and shown below.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes threshold | The combination of Initial and Subload (Polite) cannot exceed the KB limits defined in this document.  <br>  <br>User initiated content is not factored into the size measurement.  <br>  <br>If the ad contains a video element, this size is separately considered and not calculated in the Banner KB size. | Identical. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551)  <br>  <br>Banner MAX Combined Size  <br>300 x 250 - 450 KB  <br>728 x 90 - 450 KB  <br>300 x 600 - 600 KB  <br>970 x 250 - 750 KB  <br>  <br>Video Max Size  <br>1.1MB |

2\. Total requests — The total number of HTTP requests over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, pixels, event beacons, etc.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests threshold | The sum of all HTTP Requests made by an ad which include calls for ad assets, pixels, event beacons, etc. cannot exceed 100.  <br>  <br>Note that DSP's and Ad Networks may add additional HTTP requests to an ad which are included in this threshold. | Maximum number of initial load file requests is 10. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551).  <br>  <br>_Note_: Microsoft has found that 10 is quite strict when considering all pixels, beacons, etc. that are commonly included with the ad and/or added by DSPs. 1.1MB |

3\. CPU — The amount of CPU consumed by the main browser thread over a 30s period when the ad is loaded. A common cause of excessive CPU is JavaScript code/libraries. Because it's impossible to represent CPU performance across the full spectrum of user machines, we take a conservative approach and choose a threshold that errs on the lenient side.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU threshold | An ad should not impose more than an average of 30% CPU utilization during the first 30s when the ad is loaded. This translates to a total of 12s of CPU consumed on a PC with average CPU power. | 30% CPU load max (based on the average CPU of the user base) per active ad.

Since September 2020, Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge has introduced a new [browser intervention](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262194) that monitors ad iframes and may redirect them to an error page (Heavy ad intervention) if resource use exceeds specified criteria. Video advertisements, in particular, may be more vulnerable to this intervention, which impacts iframes that load more than 4 MB of data.  
  
If a creative satisfies any of the following criteria, it is considered heavy:

*   The main thread is used for more than 60 seconds in total.
*   In any 30 second window, the main thread is used for more than 15 seconds.
*   More than 4 MB of network bandwidth is consumed It is recommended that the creative is compliant with the technical specifications detailed above.

**Image-based ad deliverables**

| Ad components | File type | Dimensions |

| Short headline | Text | 40 characters max |

| Ad text | Text | 90 characters max |
| Business name | Text | 25 characters max |
| URL | Text | 1024 characters max |
| Mobile URL | Text | 1024 characters max |

**Creative best practices for audience ads**

*   Images are recommended to have no text or logo overlay for maximum flexibility.
*   Some publishers prohibit the use of embedded text within images.
*   Images can be cropped or used with headline overlays, which can result in issues if the image is text heavy.
*   If text is required (e.g., legally required/logo issues):
    *   Consider moving the text to the headlines instead of including in the image.
    *   Use fewer words.
    *   Use smaller font size.
    *   Keep text centered.
    *   Be sure to leverage the preview tool in the UI.
*   Before submitting, ensure images and text look as expected in all ad preview formats using the preview tool in the UI and ensure that there's no text overlay.
*   The image must be clearly relevant to the product or service being advertised.
*   Image assets used for Audience Ads share the same dimensions as Google Display Network, Meta Audience Network, and Yahoo Gemini.

**Safe area**

Publishers place "sponsored" or "ad" icons typically near the bottom of the image along with the headline and business name text. This should be considered when choosing image content.

Audience ads allow individual image cropping to support all aspect ratios for each ad experience. Using the preview tool is important to validate each ad experience. If your ad isn't showing as expected in each aspect ratio, you can re-crop it.

**Ad variants**

_Audience Network wide image (1:91:1)_  

_Microsoft Edge single carousel (1:78:1)_  

_MSN in-article ad (1.5:1)_  

_MSN small headline (1.33:1)_  

_Audience Network square image (1:1)_  

_Outlook.com web desktop (text)_  

_Outlook.com mobile web (text)_  

**Example**

*   Xbox video ads are site-served only.
*   Click to video only.
*   Key art assets (i.e. Layered PSD, AI, EPS, illustrations, photos, fonts) are needed for our design team to build out static banners, video banner overlays, and landing experience branded pages.

**Third-party ad served video (VAST)**

This specification covers linear video ad formats that are third-party served (ad is delivered via [IAB's Video Ad Serving Template (VAST)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262195)).

All third-party ad servers must meet the below requirements:

*   Vendor certification is required for each IAB standard and version. Work with your account team representative to verify certification or request certification for new vendors.
*   Third-party served VAST tags are required to return an ad each time the tag is called. Ad tags provided by agencies/advertisers or their contracted vendors should not restrict ad responses based on upstream or buy side targeting or capping. Publisher targeting will be enforced at the time of booking per the IO contract. This includes, but is not limited to: GEO targeting, Audience or BT targeting, frequency capping, Dayparting, etc… Furthermore, ad tags provided on a specific advertiser/brand IO contract should not rotate in ads from advertisers or brands not covered on the IO contract.  
    The following scenarios are deemed acceptable occasions when the ad may not return or may change its ad response: Ad tag is outside the agreed upon flight dates; ad is rotating between multiple ad creatives for the same brand. Note that while ad rotation is supported, all ads returned must comply with all Microsoft Advertising policies.
*   Inline ad responses are expected to provide only one (1) ad per VAST ad call. Tags may rotate the response upon refresh but may not provide more than one ad element within the XML document.
*   The duration node must be formatted as HH:MM:SS per the IAB specification. Furthermore, the duration node should represent the ad unit length (or expected ad unit length if unknown at time of VAST rendering) — it is not permitted to return a duration of 00:00:00 or 00:00:01.
*   Media files present in the ad response should provide the full range of supported frame sizes and bit rates, sorted in order of preference HD, Mobile HD, SD, Mobile SD (specifications as indicated in the above table). Please do not attempt to perform device/bandwidth detection to scope the available media files list; players will make the appropriate bit rate selection client-side.
*   Pop-up and pop-under windows are not supported on any product.

**VAST wrapper ads**

*   Ad tag tokens will not be evaluated at runtime by the player. The VAST ad tag URL should be returned fully decorated by the ad server returning the wrapper ad response. This includes but is not limited to cache busting tokens.
*   The maximum number of chained wrappers supported is currently 3 with the 4th tag expected to provide an inline ad response. Chains longer than this number cannot be guaranteed for delivery or reporting accuracy.
*   Per the IAB specification, the wrapper ad tags may provide tracking events only, no additional assets may be delivered through the wrapper payload. This includes but is not limited to: ad parameters, or media files.

**Linear VPAID**

*   Ad selector
    *   Ad selectors must time out and select a default ad if no user interaction is detected. Furthermore, ad selector timeouts will count toward the maximum duration specified above and the sum of the timeout and the ad video may not exceed the max duration.
*   Countdown/time remaining
    *   The MSN player will provide a countdown to the user to indicate the time until the ad completes. VPAID ads must implement the adRemainingTime property and adRemainingTimeChange event to indicate changes to the player to ensure that the countdown is accurate and to avoid unexpected timeouts within the player from prematurely unloading the ad experience.
    *   Ads are discouraged from presenting their own countdown UI to avoid a poor user experience of displaying redundant information.
    *   Ads should similarly not force their content to the top -most z-index to hide the countdown and mini- control bar; this action will be periodically detected, and MSFT may opt to pull ads exhibiting this behavior.
*   Error Handling
    *   Per the IAB specification, all errors within the ad must not be raised to the player unless communicated through the adError event.
    *   Furthermore, ad errors encountered during specific IAB events (AdImpression, AdVideoStart, AdVideoFirstQuartile, AdVideoMidpoint, AdVideoThirdQuartile, AdVid eoComplete) should not prevent the player from receiving these events (for example, if the ad is detecting user behavior during these events and has an internal failure, the ad is still required to notify the player of the IAB events for proper tracking and metrics — ads failing to report properly may be pulled).
*   Expansion/interactive ad experience
*   Ads may enter into an interactive state (video is paused, and interactive content is shown in the player window) or an expanded state (ad content has exceeded the standard max duration at the user's explicit request for more information).
*   Entrance: Accessible only on click of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area or on hover of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area with a minimum 5 seconds of hover time and visible indicator of the impending action as the user is hovering (i.e. progress bar, decreasing clock wedge, numerical countdown, etc.)
*   Exit: Exit button must be clearly displayed and distinguished in the top-right hand corner of the video frame, with the smallest edge not smaller than 32px. Ads failing to comply with this requirement will be pulled or blocked from launch and vendors will be placed on certification review.
*   Z-index
    *   No z-index should be set by the ad. If one is required, the z-index value cannot exceed 100.
*   Leave behind content.
    *   Linear VPAID ads may not leave behind any content after the ad video completes. Once the ad completes, the VPAID ad will be unloaded, and all visual and non-visual objects must be removed and disposed.
*   Max Duration
    *   30s unless user explicitly chooses to enter into an interactive ad experience (see below for restrictions).
*   Resizing
    *   Ads must respond when the resizeAd() method is invoked; while a 16x9 ratio is expected, it is not guaranteed, therefore ads should scale their content appropriately and not rigidly adhere to one display ratio. Ads should immediately resize, when instructed, to avoid a poor user experience and to reduce display flicker.
*   Video click-through
    *   Ads can opt to process video click events on interactive elements as they see fit; however, the following requirements must be followed for standard video click-thrus and for any navigation to pages outside of the player window:
        *   If the video playback pauses on click, the ad must render a resume button over the video content so that the user can resume the ad and reach the content experience.
        *   The VPAID AdClickThru event must be raised for video click-thrus. If the ad opts to handle the click thru directly, the destination page must open in a new (non-modal) tab/window and must not replace the current window/frame.

_IAB VPAID 2.0 support limitations_

*   Only VAST 3.0 delivery is supported at this time (see related linear video spec for more details), it is important to note that skip functionality is not supported within the player. Therefore, if skip functionality is desired VPAID 2.0 should be used.

_VPAID vendor certification_

All VPAID vendors must submit test assets for certification prior for running VPAID ads on Microsoft Advertising properties. Please work with your account team representative to submit for VPAID vendor certification. VPAID vendors are expected to VAST deliver their VPAID ad content. If the VPAID vendor will also serve linear video through the same ad server to Microsoft Advertising, they should submit for both VAST and VPAID vendor certification. Otherwise, if the VAST payload is mostly static and does not vary by advertiser, only VPAID certification is required.

_VPAID Interface Requirements_

*   All functions and properties on the VPAID object interface MUST be present even if their return values are NULL or methods are not implemented.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the initAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the startAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must update the adRemainingTime property with the actual duration of the ad or clearly indicating an unknown value within the first second after the video start event.
*   AdStarted event and AdImpression event must fire as simultaneously as possible.

_Cross-domain data request_

Vendor ad servers, CDNs, and all server-side resources referenced in the VAST tag and VPAID ad must allow Microsoft & Microsoft partner domains (\*msn.com; \*.fwmrm.net; \*.s-msn.com) to access cross-site data via the following method:

*   CORS HTTP Headers: Server response headers must contain 'allow origin' CORS HTTP headers as documented at: http://www.w3.org/TR/access -control/#access-control-al low-origin-response-header. Allow origin headers can reply with a wild card or by echoing the source origin. Please refer to the w3 documentation for details on the benefits/risks for both options.
    *   Example CORS response header:  
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*

**Other third-party served ad policies**

_Discrepancy rates between ad servers_

Microsoft does not provide guarantees relating to 3rd party served discrepancies but will commit to investigate discrepancies that exceed accepted industry standard discrepancy rates.

_Server-to-server ad calls_

Microsoft does not currently employ server-to-server ad calls for vendor ad tags. Furthermore, it is strongly preferred that Microsoft provided ad tags for third-party sourced inventory are called directly from the client, however, server-to-server ad calls can be supported provided the following attributes are communicated to the MSFT ad server on the ad call (work with your account team to get specific query-string parameters for these attributes).

*   Client IP address
*   User agent

_Max tracking pixels per event_

While no hard limit is enforced on the MSFT properties, the maximum recommended number of tracking pixels per event is set at five (5). This limit is proposed to reduce risk of latent or dropped event tracking and ensure discrepancy rates within industry norms.

**Metrics & reporting**

The following events are supported across the video product portfolio for first-party and third-party served ads.

_Video events_

*   Play (impression)
*   Video click
*   First quartile
*   Midpoint
*   Third quartile
*   Complete
*   Pause
*   Mute
*   Unmute
*   Close

Display ads performance standards
---------------------------------

This section describes the methodology, metrics, and standards Microsoft uses to assess the performance of display ads, where ad performance in this context refers to the weight or heaviness of an ad. The standards documented below are in alignment with the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) published in July 2017. Ads that do not comply with the performance standards outlined below will be prohibited from displaying on Microsoft online properties.

**Background: Why display ad performance is important**

Better ad performance is a win-win for ad providers and publishers. Said another way:

*   Poor ad performance impacts publishers' business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance impacts ad business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance contributes to the use of ad blockers.

This section describes each of the three performance metrics in more detail, including the thresholds used for flagging heavy ads.

1\. Total bytes — The total number of bytes (KB) downloaded over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, analytics calls, etc. Total Bytes thresholds are clearly defined in the Microsoft Display ad specs and shown below.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes threshold | The combination of Initial and Subload (Polite) cannot exceed the KB limits defined in this document.  <br>  <br>User initiated content is not factored into the size measurement.  <br>  <br>If the ad contains a video element, this size is separately considered and not calculated in the Banner KB size. | Identical. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551)  <br>  <br>Banner MAX Combined Size  <br>300 x 250 - 450 KB  <br>728 x 90 - 450 KB  <br>300 x 600 - 600 KB  <br>970 x 250 - 750 KB  <br>  <br>Video Max Size  <br>1.1MB |

2\. Total requests — The total number of HTTP requests over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, pixels, event beacons, etc.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests threshold | The sum of all HTTP Requests made by an ad which include calls for ad assets, pixels, event beacons, etc. cannot exceed 100.  <br>  <br>Note that DSP's and Ad Networks may add additional HTTP requests to an ad which are included in this threshold. | Maximum number of initial load file requests is 10. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551).  <br>  <br>_Note_: Microsoft has found that 10 is quite strict when considering all pixels, beacons, etc. that are commonly included with the ad and/or added by DSPs. 1.1MB |

3\. CPU — The amount of CPU consumed by the main browser thread over a 30s period when the ad is loaded. A common cause of excessive CPU is JavaScript code/libraries. Because it's impossible to represent CPU performance across the full spectrum of user machines, we take a conservative approach and choose a threshold that errs on the lenient side.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU threshold | An ad should not impose more than an average of 30% CPU utilization during the first 30s when the ad is loaded. This translates to a total of 12s of CPU consumed on a PC with average CPU power. | 30% CPU load max (based on the average CPU of the user base) per active ad. Please refer to the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) for additional information. |

##### Important

Since September 2020, Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge has introduced a new [browser intervention](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262194) that monitors ad iframes and may redirect them to an error page (Heavy ad intervention) if resource use exceeds specified criteria. Video advertisements, in particular, may be more vulnerable to this intervention, which impacts iframes that load more than 4 MB of data.  
  
If a creative satisfies any of the following criteria, it is considered heavy:

*   The main thread is used for more than 60 seconds in total.
*   In any 30 second window, the main thread is used for more than 15 seconds.
*   More than 4 MB of network bandwidth is consumed It is recommended that the creative is compliant with the technical specifications detailed above.

[Native ads creative specs](#apex/ads/en/60207/0/#exp405)

Microsoft Audience Network
--------------------------

**Overview**

Microsoft Audience Ads allow you to immerse your brand within publisher sites to reach the right audience, at the right time, within the right context. This winning combination drives engagement, click-through rate (CTR), cost per acquisition (CPA), and more to enhance your campaign performance.

Getting started is simple.

*   For image-based ads: Upload an image, copy, and URL. Microsoft Advertising will format your content to match the unique look and feel of the publisher site, whether it's displayed on a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.
*   For Video & Connected TV ads: Upload your video creative, adhering to our video quality ratings that are outlined below. The quality of your video will determine where your ads can serve—the higher the video quality, the more premium placements you'll be able to access. Note, Video & Connected TV ads are currently in open beta; so, they may not be available yet to all advertisers. Get in touch with your account team to know more.

**Image-based ad deliverables**

| Ad components | File type | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Image | JPEG or PNG | Recommended: 1200 x 628 or higher.  <br>Minimum: 703 x 368 |
| Short headline | Text | 40 characters max |
| Long headline | Text | 90 characters max |
| Ad text | Text | 90 characters max |
| Business name | Text | 25 characters max |
| URL | Text | 1024 characters max |
| Mobile URL | Text | 1024 characters max |

**Creative best practices for audience ads**

*   Images are recommended to have no text or logo overlay for maximum flexibility.
*   Some publishers prohibit the use of embedded text within images.
*   Images can be cropped or used with headline overlays, which can result in issues if the image is text heavy.
*   If text is required (e.g., legally required/logo issues):
    *   Consider moving the text to the headlines instead of including in the image.
    *   Use fewer words.
    *   Use smaller font size.
    *   Keep text centered.
    *   Be sure to leverage the preview tool in the UI.
*   Before submitting, ensure images and text look as expected in all ad preview formats using the preview tool in the UI and ensure that there's no text overlay.
*   The image must be clearly relevant to the product or service being advertised.
*   Image assets used for Audience Ads share the same dimensions as Google Display Network, Meta Audience Network, and Yahoo Gemini.

**Safe area**

Publishers place "sponsored" or "ad" icons typically near the bottom of the image along with the headline and business name text. This should be considered when choosing image content.

Audience ads allow individual image cropping to support all aspect ratios for each ad experience. Using the preview tool is important to validate each ad experience. If your ad isn't showing as expected in each aspect ratio, you can re-crop it.

**Ad variants**

_Audience Network wide image (1:91:1)_  

_Microsoft Edge single carousel (1:78:1)_  

_MSN in-article ad (1.5:1)_

With Video & Connected TV ads, advertisers can reach their audience across a wide range of online Video and Connected TV inventory. To access more premium online video and CTV inventory, advertisers need to upload higher quality assets.

Video assets are categorized in three ways: Good Quality, Excellent Quality, and Perfect Quality.

Once you upload your videos to Microsoft Advertising, the system will determine which quality standards your video meets using a three-star rating—with three stars being the highest.

Use the below guidelines to understand what the requirements are for each of the different video qualities. If you wish to advertise on our most premium inventory, ensure that your video meets the Excellent Quality requirements.

**Guidelines and specifications for third-party video creatives**

Adhere to these guidelines and specifications when creating video creatives that will be trafficked through a third-party ad server:

*   External VAST ad servers must submit content to our VAST Check functionality before it can be saved.
*   There are no size or format restrictions on video creatives served by external ad servers.
*   If serving VAST video creatives on Google inventory, their duration should be a maximum of 15 or 30 seconds. If you want to serve video creatives over 15 seconds in duration, we recommend that your creative contain the skippable element.
*   Make sure that the video creatives included in your VAST document are transcoded using the FLV, MP4, and WebM file types.
*   Multiple bitrates should be provided for in-stream video creatives that have been transcoded using the FLV, MP4, and WebM file types. The following bitrates are recommended:
    *   500 kbps (optimized for mobile devices on cellular connection and required by many mobile SSPs)
    *   1200 kbps
    *   2500 kbps (optimized for high-speed connections)
*   Use secure tags in all cases. If you are trafficking VPAID creatives, make sure to properly secure every referenced file.

*   Click to video only.
*   Key art assets (i.e. Layered PSD, AI, EPS, illustrations, photos, fonts) are needed for our design team to build out static banners, video banner overlays, and landing experience branded pages.

**Third-party ad served video (VAST)**

This specification covers linear video ad formats that are third-party served (ad is delivered via [IAB's Video Ad Serving Template (VAST)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262195)).

All third-party ad servers must meet the below requirements:

*   Vendor certification is required for each IAB standard and version. Work with your account team representative to verify certification or request certification for new vendors.
*   Third-party served VAST tags are required to return an ad each time the tag is called. Ad tags provided by agencies/advertisers or their contracted vendors should not restrict ad responses based on upstream or buy side targeting or capping. Publisher targeting will be enforced at the time of booking per the IO contract. This includes, but is not limited to: GEO targeting, Audience or BT targeting, frequency capping, Dayparting, etc… Furthermore, ad tags provided on a specific advertiser/brand IO contract should not rotate in ads from advertisers or brands not covered on the IO contract.  
    The following scenarios are deemed acceptable occasions when the ad may not return or may change its ad response: Ad tag is outside the agreed upon flight dates; ad is rotating between multiple ad creatives for the same brand. Note that while ad rotation is supported, all ads returned must comply with all Microsoft Advertising policies.
*   Inline ad responses are expected to provide only one (1) ad per VAST ad call. Tags may rotate the response upon refresh but may not provide more than one ad element within the XML document.
*   The duration node must be formatted as HH:MM:SS per the IAB specification. Furthermore, the duration node should represent the ad unit length (or expected ad unit length if unknown at time of VAST rendering) — it is not permitted to return a duration of 00:00:00 or 00:00:01.
*   Media files present in the ad response should provide the full range of supported frame sizes and bit rates, sorted in order of preference HD, Mobile HD, SD, Mobile SD (specifications as indicated in the above table). Please do not attempt to perform device/bandwidth detection to scope the available media files list; players will make the appropriate bit rate selection client-side.
*   Pop-up and pop-under windows are not supported on any product.

**VAST wrapper ads**

*   Ad tag tokens will not be evaluated at runtime by the player. The VAST ad tag URL should be returned fully decorated by the ad server returning the wrapper ad response. This includes but is not limited to cache busting tokens.
*   The maximum number of chained wrappers supported is currently 3 with the 4th tag expected to provide an inline ad response. Chains longer than this number cannot be guaranteed for delivery or reporting accuracy.
*   Per the IAB specification, the wrapper ad tags may provide tracking events only, no additional assets may be delivered through the wrapper payload. This includes but is not limited to: ad parameters, or media files.

**Linear VPAID**

*   Ad selector
    *   Ad selectors must time out and select a default ad if no user interaction is detected. Furthermore, ad selector timeouts will count toward the maximum duration specified above and the sum of the timeout and the ad video may not exceed the max duration.
*   Countdown/time remaining
    *   The MSN player will provide a countdown to the user to indicate the time until the ad completes. VPAID ads must implement the adRemainingTime property and adRemainingTimeChange event to indicate changes to the player to ensure that the countdown is accurate and to avoid unexpected timeouts within the player from prematurely unloading the ad experience.
    *   Ads are discouraged from presenting their own countdown UI to avoid a poor user experience of displaying redundant information.
    *   Ads should similarly not force their content to the top -most z-index to hide the countdown and mini- control bar; this action will be periodically detected, and MSFT may opt to pull ads exhibiting this behavior.
*   Error Handling
    *   Per the IAB specification, all errors within the ad must not be raised to the player unless communicated through the adError event.
    *   Furthermore, ad errors encountered during specific IAB events (AdImpression, AdVideoStart, AdVideoFirstQuartile, AdVideoMidpoint, AdVideoThirdQuartile, AdVid eoComplete) should not prevent the player from receiving these events (for example, if the ad is detecting user behavior during these events and has an internal failure, the ad is still required to notify the player of the IAB events for proper tracking and metrics — ads failing to report properly may be pulled).
*   Expansion/interactive ad experience
*   Ads may enter into an interactive state (video is paused, and interactive content is shown in the player window) or an expanded state (ad content has exceeded the standard max duration at the user's explicit request for more information).
*   Entrance: Accessible only on click of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area or on hover of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area with a minimum 5 seconds of hover time and visible indicator of the impending action as the user is hovering (i.e. progress bar, decreasing clock wedge, numerical countdown, etc.)
*   Exit: Exit button must be clearly displayed and distinguished in the top-right hand corner of the video frame, with the smallest edge not smaller than 32px. Ads failing to comply with this requirement will be pulled or blocked from launch and vendors will be placed on certification review.
*   Z-index
    *   No z-index should be set by the ad. If one is required, the z-index value cannot exceed 100.
*   Leave behind content.
    *   Linear VPAID ads may not leave behind any content after the ad video completes. Once the ad completes, the VPAID ad will be unloaded, and all visual and non-visual objects must be removed and disposed.
*   Max Duration
    *   30s unless user explicitly chooses to enter into an interactive ad experience (see below for restrictions).
*   Resizing
    *   Ads must respond when the resizeAd() method is invoked; while a 16x9 ratio is expected, it is not guaranteed, therefore ads should scale their content appropriately and not rigidly adhere to one display ratio. Ads should immediately resize, when instructed, to avoid a poor user experience and to reduce display flicker.
*   Video click-through
    *   Ads can opt to process video click events on interactive elements as they see fit; however, the following requirements must be followed for standard video click-thrus and for any navigation to pages outside of the player window:
        *   If the video playback pauses on click, the ad must render a resume button over the video content so that the user can resume the ad and reach the content experience.
        *   The VPAID AdClickThru event must be raised for video click-thrus. If the ad opts to handle the click thru directly, the destination page must open in a new (non-modal) tab/window and must not replace the current window/frame.

_IAB VPAID 2.0 support limitations_

*   Only VAST 3.0 delivery is supported at this time (see related linear video spec for more details), it is important to note that skip functionality is not supported within the player. Therefore, if skip functionality is desired VPAID 2.0 should be used.

_VPAID vendor certification_

All VPAID vendors must submit test assets for certification prior for running VPAID ads on Microsoft Advertising properties. Please work with your account team representative to submit for VPAID vendor certification. VPAID vendors are expected to VAST deliver their VPAID ad content. If the VPAID vendor will also serve linear video through the same ad server to Microsoft Advertising, they should submit for both VAST and VPAID vendor certification. Otherwise, if the VAST payload is mostly static and does not vary by advertiser, only VPAID certification is required.

_VPAID Interface Requirements_

*   All functions and properties on the VPAID object interface MUST be present even if their return values are NULL or methods are not implemented.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the initAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the startAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must update the adRemainingTime property with the actual duration of the ad or clearly indicating an unknown value within the first second after the video start event.
*   AdStarted event and AdImpression event must fire as simultaneously as possible.

_Cross-domain data request_

Vendor ad servers, CDNs, and all server-side resources referenced in the VAST tag and VPAID ad must allow Microsoft & Microsoft partner domains (\*msn.com; \*.fwmrm.net; \*.s-msn.com) to access cross-site data via the following method:

*   CORS HTTP Headers: Server response headers must contain 'allow origin' CORS HTTP headers as documented at: http://www.w3.org/TR/access -control/#access-control-al low-origin-response-header. Allow origin headers can reply with a wild card or by echoing the source origin. Please refer to the w3 documentation for details on the benefits/risks for both options.
    *   Example CORS response header:  
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*

**Other third-party served ad policies**

_Discrepancy rates between ad servers_

Microsoft does not provide guarantees relating to 3rd party served discrepancies but will commit to investigate discrepancies that exceed accepted industry standard discrepancy rates.

_Server-to-server ad calls_

Microsoft does not currently employ server-to-server ad calls for vendor ad tags. Furthermore, it is strongly preferred that Microsoft provided ad tags for third-party sourced inventory are called directly from the client, however, server-to-server ad calls can be supported provided the following attributes are communicated to the MSFT ad server on the ad call (work with your account team to get specific query-string parameters for these attributes).

*   Client IP address
*   User agent

_Max tracking pixels per event_

While no hard limit is enforced on the MSFT properties, the maximum recommended number of tracking pixels per event is set at five (5). This limit is proposed to reduce risk of latent or dropped event tracking and ensure discrepancy rates within industry norms.

**Metrics & reporting**

The following events are supported across the video product portfolio for first-party and third-party served ads.

_Video events_

*   Play (impression)
*   Video click
*   First quartile
*   Midpoint
*   Third quartile
*   Complete
*   Pause
*   Mute
*   Unmute
*   Close

Display ads performance standards
---------------------------------

This section describes the methodology, metrics, and standards Microsoft uses to assess the performance of display ads, where ad performance in this context refers to the weight or heaviness of an ad. The standards documented below are in alignment with the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) published in July 2017. Ads that do not comply with the performance standards outlined below will be prohibited from displaying on Microsoft online properties.

**Background: Why display ad performance is important**

Better ad performance is a win-win for ad providers and publishers. Said another way:

*   Poor ad performance impacts publishers' business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance impacts ad business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance contributes to the use of ad blockers.

This section describes each of the three performance metrics in more detail, including the thresholds used for flagging heavy ads.

1\. Total bytes — The total number of bytes (KB) downloaded over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, analytics calls, etc. Total Bytes thresholds are clearly defined in the Microsoft Display ad specs and shown below.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes threshold | The combination of Initial and Subload (Polite) cannot exceed the KB limits defined in this document.  <br>  <br>User initiated content is not factored into the size measurement.  <br>  <br>If the ad contains a video element, this size is separately considered and not calculated in the Banner KB size. | Identical. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551)  <br>  <br>Banner MAX Combined Size  <br>300 x 250 - 450 KB  <br>728 x 90 - 450 KB  <br>300 x 600 - 600 KB  <br>970 x 250 - 750 KB  <br>  <br>Video Max Size  <br>1.1MB |

2\. Total requests — The total number of HTTP requests over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, pixels, event beacons, etc.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests threshold | The sum of all HTTP Requests made by an ad which include calls for ad assets, pixels, event beacons, etc. cannot exceed 100.  <br>  <br>Note that DSP's and Ad Networks may add additional HTTP requests to an ad which are included in this threshold. | Maximum number of initial load file requests is 10. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551).  <br>  <br>_Note_: Microsoft has found that 10 is quite strict when considering all pixels, beacons, etc. that are commonly included with the ad and/or added by DSPs. 1.1MB |

3\. CPU — The amount of CPU consumed by the main browser thread over a 30s period when the ad is loaded. A common cause of excessive CPU is JavaScript code/libraries. Because it's impossible to represent CPU performance across the full spectrum of user machines, we take a conservative approach and choose a threshold that errs on the lenient side.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU threshold | An ad should not impose more than an average of 30% CPU utilization during the first 30s when the ad is loaded. This translates to a total of 12s of CPU consumed on a PC with average CPU power. | 30% CPU load max (based on the average CPU of the user base) per active ad. Please refer to the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) for additional information. |

##### Important

Since September 2020, Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge has introduced a new [browser intervention](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262194) that monitors ad iframes and may redirect them to an error page (Heavy ad intervention) if resource use exceeds specified criteria. Video advertisements, in particular, may be more vulnerable to this intervention, which impacts iframes that load more than 4 MB of data.  
  
If a creative satisfies any of the following criteria, it is considered heavy:

*   The main thread is used for more than 60 seconds in total.
*   In any 30 second window, the main thread is used for more than 15 seconds.
*   More than 4 MB of network bandwidth is consumed It is recommended that the creative is compliant with the technical specifications detailed above.

Microsoft Audience Network
--------------------------

**Overview**

Microsoft Audience Ads allow you to immerse your brand within publisher sites to reach the right audience, at the right time, within the right context. This winning combination drives engagement, click-through rate (CTR), cost per acquisition (CPA), and more to enhance your campaign performance.

Getting started is simple.

*   For image-based ads: Upload an image, copy, and URL. Microsoft Advertising will format your content to match the unique look and feel of the publisher site, whether it's displayed on a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.
*   For Video & Connected TV ads: Upload your video creative, adhering to our video quality ratings that are outlined below. The quality of your video will determine where your ads can serve—the higher the video quality, the more premium placements you'll be able to access. Note, Video & Connected TV ads are currently in open beta; so, they may not be available yet to all advertisers. Get in touch with your account team to know more.

**Image-based ad deliverables**

| Ad components | File type | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Image | JPEG or PNG | Recommended: 1200 x 628 or higher.  <br>Minimum: 703 x 368 |
| Short headline | Text | 40 characters max |
| Long headline | Text | 90 characters max |
| Ad text | Text | 90 characters max |
| Business name | Text | 25 characters max |
| URL | Text | 1024 characters max |
| Mobile URL | Text | 1024 characters max |

**Creative best practices for audience ads**

*   Images are recommended to have no text or logo overlay for maximum flexibility.
*   Some publishers prohibit the use of embedded text within images.
*   Images can be cropped or used with headline overlays, which can result in issues if the image is text heavy.
*   If text is required (e.g., legally required/logo issues):
    *   Consider moving the text to the headlines instead of including in the image.
    *   Use fewer words.
    *   Use smaller font size.
    *   Keep text centered.
    *   Be sure to leverage the preview tool in the UI.
*   Before submitting, ensure images and text look as expected in all ad preview formats using the preview tool in the UI and ensure that there's no text overlay.
*   The image must be clearly relevant to the product or service being advertised.
*   Image assets used for Audience Ads share the same dimensions as Google Display Network, Meta Audience Network, and Yahoo Gemini.

**Safe area**

Publishers place "sponsored" or "ad" icons typically near the bottom of the image along with the headline and business name text. This should be considered when choosing image content.

Audience ads allow individual image cropping to support all aspect ratios for each ad experience. Using the preview tool is important to validate each ad experience. If your ad isn't showing as expected in each aspect ratio, you can re-crop it.

**Ad variants**

_Audience Network wide image (1:91:1)_  

_Microsoft Edge single carousel (1:78:1)_  

_MSN in-article ad (1.5:1)_  

_MSN small headline (1.33:1)_  

_Audience Network square image (1:1)_  

_Outlook.com web desktop (text)_  

_Outlook.com mobile web (text)_  

**Example**

_MSN homepage PC web_

**Video-based ad deliverables**

With Video & Connected TV ads, advertisers can reach their audience across a wide range of online Video and Connected TV inventory. To access more premium online video and CTV inventory, advertisers need to upload higher quality assets.

Video assets are categorized in three ways: Good Quality, Excellent Quality, and Perfect Quality.

Once you upload your videos to Microsoft Advertising, the system will determine which quality standards your video meets using a three-star rating—with three stars being the highest.

Use the below guidelines to understand what the requirements are for each of the different video qualities. If you wish to advertise on our most premium inventory, ensure that your video meets the Excellent Quality requirements.

**Guidelines and specifications for third-party video creatives**

Adhere to these guidelines and specifications when creating video creatives that will be trafficked through a third-party ad server:

*   External VAST ad servers must submit content to our VAST Check functionality before it can be saved.
*   There are no size or format restrictions on video creatives served by external ad servers.
*   If serving VAST video creatives on Google inventory, their duration should be a maximum of 15 or 30 seconds. If you want to serve video creatives over 15 seconds in duration, we recommend that your creative contain the skippable element.
*   Make sure that the video creatives included in your VAST document are transcoded using the FLV, MP4, and WebM file types.
*   Multiple bitrates should be provided for in-stream video creatives that have been transcoded using the FLV, MP4, and WebM file types. The following bitrates are recommended:
    *   500 kbps (optimized for mobile devices on cellular connection and required by many mobile SSPs)
    *   1200 kbps
    *   2500 kbps (optimized for high-speed connections)
*   Use secure tags in all cases. If you are trafficking VPAID creatives, make sure to properly secure every referenced file.

With Video & Connected TV ads, advertisers can reach their audience across a wide range of online Video and Connected TV inventory. To access more premium online video and CTV inventory, advertisers need to upload higher quality assets.

Video assets are categorized in three ways:

*   Good Quality
*   Excellent Quality
*   Perfect Quality

Once you upload your videos to Microsoft Advertising, the system will determine which quality standards your video meets using a three-star rating, with three stars being the highest.

Use the below guidelines to understand what the requirements are for each of the different video qualities. If you wish to advertise on our most premium inventory, ensure that your video meets the excellent quality requirements.

_Xbox_

*   Xbox video ads are site-served only.
*   Click to video only.
*   Key art assets (i.e. Layered PSD, AI, EPS, illustrations, photos, fonts) are needed for our design team to build out static banners, video banner overlays, and landing experience branded pages.

**Third-party ad served video (VAST)**

This specification covers linear video ad formats that are third-party served (ad is delivered via [IAB's Video Ad Serving Template (VAST)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262195)).

All third-party ad servers must meet the below requirements:

*   Vendor certification is required for each IAB standard and version. Work with your account team representative to verify certification or request certification for new vendors.
*   Third-party served VAST tags are required to return an ad each time the tag is called. Ad tags provided by agencies/advertisers or their contracted vendors should not restrict ad responses based on upstream or buy side targeting or capping. Publisher targeting will be enforced at the time of booking per the IO contract. This includes, but is not limited to: GEO targeting, Audience or BT targeting, frequency capping, Dayparting, etc… Furthermore, ad tags provided on a specific advertiser/brand IO contract should not rotate in ads from advertisers or brands not covered on the IO contract.  
    The following scenarios are deemed acceptable occasions when the ad may not return or may change its ad response: Ad tag is outside the agreed upon flight dates; ad is rotating between multiple ad creatives for the same brand. Note that while ad rotation is supported, all ads returned must comply with all Microsoft Advertising policies.
*   Inline ad responses are expected to provide only one (1) ad per VAST ad call. Tags may rotate the response upon refresh but may not provide more than one ad element within the XML document.
*   The duration node must be formatted as HH:MM:SS per the IAB specification. Furthermore, the duration node should represent the ad unit length (or expected ad unit length if unknown at time of VAST rendering) — it is not permitted to return a duration of 00:00:00 or 00:00:01.
*   Media files present in the ad response should provide the full range of supported frame sizes and bit rates, sorted in order of preference HD, Mobile HD, SD, Mobile SD (specifications as indicated in the above table). Please do not attempt to perform device/bandwidth detection to scope the available media files list; players will make the appropriate bit rate selection client-side.
*   Pop-up and pop-under windows are not supported on any product.

**VAST wrapper ads**

*   Ad tag tokens will not be evaluated at runtime by the player. The VAST ad tag URL should be returned fully decorated by the ad server returning the wrapper ad response. This includes but is not limited to cache busting tokens.
*   The maximum number of chained wrappers supported is currently 3 with the 4th tag expected to provide an inline ad response. Chains longer than this number cannot be guaranteed for delivery or reporting accuracy.
*   Per the IAB specification, the wrapper ad tags may provide tracking events only, no additional assets may be delivered through the wrapper payload. This includes but is not limited to: ad parameters, or media files.

**Linear VPAID**

*   Ad selector
    *   Ad selectors must time out and select a default ad if no user interaction is detected. Furthermore, ad selector timeouts will count toward the maximum duration specified above and the sum of the timeout and the ad video may not exceed the max duration.
*   Countdown/time remaining
    *   The MSN player will provide a countdown to the user to indicate the time until the ad completes. VPAID ads must implement the adRemainingTime property and adRemainingTimeChange event to indicate changes to the player to ensure that the countdown is accurate and to avoid unexpected timeouts within the player from prematurely unloading the ad experience.
    *   Ads are discouraged from presenting their own countdown UI to avoid a poor user experience of displaying redundant information.
    *   Ads should similarly not force their content to the top -most z-index to hide the countdown and mini- control bar; this action will be periodically detected, and MSFT may opt to pull ads exhibiting this behavior.
*   Error Handling
    *   Per the IAB specification, all errors within the ad must not be raised to the player unless communicated through the adError event.
    *   Furthermore, ad errors encountered during specific IAB events (AdImpression, AdVideoStart, AdVideoFirstQuartile, AdVideoMidpoint, AdVideoThirdQuartile, AdVid eoComplete) should not prevent the player from receiving these events (for example, if the ad is detecting user behavior during these events and has an internal failure, the ad is still required to notify the player of the IAB events for proper tracking and metrics — ads failing to report properly may be pulled).
*   Expansion/interactive ad experience
*   Ads may enter into an interactive state (video is paused, and interactive content is shown in the player window) or an expanded state (ad content has exceeded the standard max duration at the user's explicit request for more information).
*   Entrance: Accessible only on click of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area or on hover of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area with a minimum 5 seconds of hover time and visible indicator of the impending action as the user is hovering (i.e. progress bar, decreasing clock wedge, numerical countdown, etc.)
*   Exit: Exit button must be clearly displayed and distinguished in the top-right hand corner of the video frame, with the smallest edge not smaller than 32px. Ads failing to comply with this requirement will be pulled or blocked from launch and vendors will be placed on certification review.
*   Z-index
    *   No z-index should be set by the ad. If one is required, the z-index value cannot exceed 100.
*   Leave behind content.
    *   Linear VPAID ads may not leave behind any content after the ad video completes. Once the ad completes, the VPAID ad will be unloaded, and all visual and non-visual objects must be removed and disposed.
*   Max Duration
    *   30s unless user explicitly chooses to enter into an interactive ad experience (see below for restrictions).
*   Resizing
    *   Ads must respond when the resizeAd() method is invoked; while a 16x9 ratio is expected, it is not guaranteed, therefore ads should scale their content appropriately and not rigidly adhere to one display ratio. Ads should immediately resize, when instructed, to avoid a poor user experience and to reduce display flicker.
*   Video click-through
    *   Ads can opt to process video click events on interactive elements as they see fit; however, the following requirements must be followed for standard video click-thrus and for any navigation to pages outside of the player window:
        *   If the video playback pauses on click, the ad must render a resume button over the video content so that the user can resume the ad and reach the content experience.
        *   The VPAID AdClickThru event must be raised for video click-thrus. If the ad opts to handle the click thru directly, the destination page must open in a new (non-modal) tab/window and must not replace the current window/frame.

_IAB VPAID 2.0 support limitations_

*   Only VAST 3.0 delivery is supported at this time (see related linear video spec for more details), it is important to note that skip functionality is not supported within the player. Therefore, if skip functionality is desired VPAID 2.0 should be used.

_VPAID vendor certification_

All VPAID vendors must submit test assets for certification prior for running VPAID ads on Microsoft Advertising properties. Please work with your account team representative to submit for VPAID vendor certification. VPAID vendors are expected to VAST deliver their VPAID ad content. If the VPAID vendor will also serve linear video through the same ad server to Microsoft Advertising, they should submit for both VAST and VPAID vendor certification. Otherwise, if the VAST payload is mostly static and does not vary by advertiser, only VPAID certification is required.

_VPAID Interface Requirements_

*   All functions and properties on the VPAID object interface MUST be present even if their return values are NULL or methods are not implemented.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the initAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the startAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must update the adRemainingTime property with the actual duration of the ad or clearly indicating an unknown value within the first second after the video start event.
*   AdStarted event and AdImpression event must fire as simultaneously as possible.

_Cross-domain data request_

Vendor ad servers, CDNs, and all server-side resources referenced in the VAST tag and VPAID ad must allow Microsoft & Microsoft partner domains (\*msn.com; \*.fwmrm.net; \*.s-msn.com) to access cross-site data via the following method:

*   CORS HTTP Headers: Server response headers must contain 'allow origin' CORS HTTP headers as documented at: http://www.w3.org/TR/access -control/#access-control-al low-origin-response-header. Allow origin headers can reply with a wild card or by echoing the source origin. Please refer to the w3 documentation for details on the benefits/risks for both options.
    *   Example CORS response header:  
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*

**Other third-party served ad policies**

_Discrepancy rates between ad servers_

Microsoft does not provide guarantees relating to 3rd party served discrepancies but will commit to investigate discrepancies that exceed accepted industry standard discrepancy rates.

_Server-to-server ad calls_

Microsoft does not currently employ server-to-server ad calls for vendor ad tags. Furthermore, it is strongly preferred that Microsoft provided ad tags for third-party sourced inventory are called directly from the client, however, server-to-server ad calls can be supported provided the following attributes are communicated to the MSFT ad server on the ad call (work with your account team to get specific query-string parameters for these attributes).

*   Client IP address
*   User agent

_Max tracking pixels per event_

While no hard limit is enforced on the MSFT properties, the maximum recommended number of tracking pixels per event is set at five (5). This limit is proposed to reduce risk of latent or dropped event tracking and ensure discrepancy rates within industry norms.

**Metrics & reporting**

The following events are supported across the video product portfolio for first-party and third-party served ads.

_Video events_

*   Play (impression)
*   Video click
*   First quartile
*   Midpoint
*   Third quartile
*   Complete
*   Pause
*   Mute
*   Unmute
*   Close

Display ads performance standards
---------------------------------

This section describes the methodology, metrics, and standards Microsoft uses to assess the performance of display ads, where ad performance in this context refers to the weight or heaviness of an ad. The standards documented below are in alignment with the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) published in July 2017. Ads that do not comply with the performance standards outlined below will be prohibited from displaying on Microsoft online properties.

**Background: Why display ad performance is important**

Better ad performance is a win-win for ad providers and publishers. Said another way:

*   Poor ad performance impacts publishers' business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance impacts ad business metrics.
*   Poor ad performance contributes to the use of ad blockers.

This section describes each of the three performance metrics in more detail, including the thresholds used for flagging heavy ads.

1\. Total bytes — The total number of bytes (KB) downloaded over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, analytics calls, etc. Total Bytes thresholds are clearly defined in the Microsoft Display ad specs and shown below.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes threshold | The combination of Initial and Subload (Polite) cannot exceed the KB limits defined in this document.  <br>  <br>User initiated content is not factored into the size measurement.  <br>  <br>If the ad contains a video element, this size is separately considered and not calculated in the Banner KB size. | Identical. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551)  <br>  <br>Banner MAX Combined Size  <br>300 x 250 - 450 KB  <br>728 x 90 - 450 KB  <br>300 x 600 - 600 KB  <br>970 x 250 - 750 KB  <br>  <br>Video Max Size  <br>1.1MB |

2\. Total requests — The total number of HTTP requests over the network for all ad-related assets, including HTML, JS, CSS, images, pixels, event beacons, etc.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests threshold | The sum of all HTTP Requests made by an ad which include calls for ad assets, pixels, event beacons, etc. cannot exceed 100.  <br>  <br>Note that DSP's and Ad Networks may add additional HTTP requests to an ad which are included in this threshold. | Maximum number of initial load file requests is 10. See [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551).  <br>  <br>_Note_: Microsoft has found that 10 is quite strict when considering all pixels, beacons, etc. that are commonly included with the ad and/or added by DSPs. 1.1MB |

3\. CPU — The amount of CPU consumed by the main browser thread over a 30s period when the ad is loaded. A common cause of excessive CPU is JavaScript code/libraries. Because it's impossible to represent CPU performance across the full spectrum of user machines, we take a conservative approach and choose a threshold that errs on the lenient side.

|     | Microsoft | IAB guidelines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU threshold | An ad should not impose more than an average of 30% CPU utilization during the first 30s when the ad is loaded. This translates to a total of 12s of CPU consumed on a PC with average CPU power. | 30% CPU load max (based on the average CPU of the user base) per active ad. Please refer to the [IAB Guidelines](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262551) for additional information. |

##### Important

Since September 2020, Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge has introduced a new [browser intervention](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262194) that monitors ad iframes and may redirect them to an error page (Heavy ad intervention) if resource use exceeds specified criteria. Video advertisements, in particular, may be more vulnerable to this intervention, which impacts iframes that load more than 4 MB of data.  
  
If a creative satisfies any of the following criteria, it is considered heavy:

*   The main thread is used for more than 60 seconds in total.
*   In any 30 second window, the main thread is used for more than 15 seconds.
*   More than 4 MB of network bandwidth is consumed It is recommended that the creative is compliant with the technical specifications detailed above.

| Business name | Text | 25 characters max |
| URL | Text | 1024 characters max |

**Creative best practices for audience ads**

*   Images are recommended to have no text or logo overlay for maximum flexibility.
*   Some publishers prohibit the use of embedded text within images.
*   Images can be cropped or used with headline overlays, which can result in issues if the image is text heavy.
*   If text is required (e.g., legally required/logo issues):
    *   Consider moving the text to the headlines instead of including in the image.
    *   Use fewer words.
    *   Use smaller font size.
    *   Keep text centered.
    *   Be sure to leverage the preview tool in the UI.
*   Before submitting, ensure images and text look as expected in all ad preview formats using the preview tool in the UI and ensure that there's no text overlay.
*   The image must be clearly relevant to the product or service being advertised.
*   Image assets used for Audience Ads share the same dimensions as Google Display Network, Meta Audience Network, and Yahoo Gemini.

**Safe area**

Publishers place "sponsored" or "ad" icons typically near the bottom of the image along with the headline and business name text. This should be considered when choosing image content.

Audience ads allow individual image cropping to support all aspect ratios for each ad experience. Using the preview tool is important to validate each ad experience. If your ad isn't showing as expected in each aspect ratio, you can re-crop it.

**Ad variants**

_Audience Network wide image (1:91:1)_  

_Microsoft Edge single carousel (1:78:1)_  

_MSN in-article ad (1.5:1)_  

_MSN small headline (1.33:1)_  

_Audience Network square image (1:1)_  

_Outlook.com web desktop (text)_  

_Outlook.com mobile web (text)_  

**Example**

_MSN homepage PC web_

**Legend**

*   Full Screen
    *   User choice: User may opt to view ad and/or content in full screen mode. Application code may not trigger this state without explicit user consent.
*   Ad Skipping
    *   VPAID app: VPAID ad may opt to show skip ad option. Player will not present ad skipping to the user.
*   Video Click Area
    *   Area within player where click events are available to trigger a click-through or other interactive activity.
    *   VPAID app: Ad controls click area within the available display area.
*   Player controls (controls presented to user during ad experience playback)
    *   Full: Full range of controls are presented as a lower 1/3 frame overlay that appears on mouse over or tap on the player area (controls include: play/pause, mute, volume control and possibly more)
    *   Reduced: Video player controls are reduced to only play/pause and mute controls presented in top & bottom frame slim, permanent overlays to avoid player UI overlap with "bug" or other interactive elements.
*   Display area: Area within player which is available to the VPAID ad.
    *   Full: Full frame of player is available _Note_: Player's controls presented as overlays are not deducted from the display area. Ads should take this padding into consideration when certifying ad formats on MSN.
    *   Reduced: Video player will reduce the player display area to accommodate for persistent player controls. VPAID ads will be made aware of the available area through the initAd() and resizeAd() method calls.

_Xbox_

*   Xbox video ads are site-served only.
*   Click to video only.
*   Key art assets (i.e. Layered PSD, AI, EPS, illustrations, photos, fonts) are needed for our design team to build out static banners, video banner overlays, and landing experience branded pages.

**Third-party ad served video (VAST)**

This specification covers linear video ad formats that are third-party served (ad is delivered via [IAB's Video Ad Serving Template (VAST)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2262195)).

All third-party ad servers must meet the below requirements:

*   Vendor certification is required for each IAB standard and version. Work with your account team representative to verify certification or request certification for new vendors.
*   Third-party served VAST tags are required to return an ad each time the tag is called. Ad tags provided by agencies/advertisers or their contracted vendors should not restrict ad responses based on upstream or buy side targeting or capping. Publisher targeting will be enforced at the time of booking per the IO contract. This includes, but is not limited to: GEO targeting, Audience or BT targeting, frequency capping, Dayparting, etc… Furthermore, ad tags provided on a specific advertiser/brand IO contract should not rotate in ads from advertisers or brands not covered on the IO contract.  
    The following scenarios are deemed acceptable occasions when the ad may not return or may change its ad response: Ad tag is outside the agreed upon flight dates; ad is rotating between multiple ad creatives for the same brand. Note that while ad rotation is supported, all ads returned must comply with all Microsoft Advertising policies.
*   Inline ad responses are expected to provide only one (1) ad per VAST ad call. Tags may rotate the response upon refresh but may not provide more than one ad element within the XML document.
*   The duration node must be formatted as HH:MM:SS per the IAB specification. Furthermore, the duration node should represent the ad unit length (or expected ad unit length if unknown at time of VAST rendering) — it is not permitted to return a duration of 00:00:00 or 00:00:01.
*   Media files present in the ad response should provide the full range of supported frame sizes and bit rates, sorted in order of preference HD, Mobile HD, SD, Mobile SD (specifications as indicated in the above table). Please do not attempt to perform device/bandwidth detection to scope the available media files list; players will make the appropriate bit rate selection client-side.
*   Pop-up and pop-under windows are not supported on any product.

**VAST wrapper ads**

*   Ad tag tokens will not be evaluated at runtime by the player. The VAST ad tag URL should be returned fully decorated by the ad server returning the wrapper ad response. This includes but is not limited to cache busting tokens.
*   The maximum number of chained wrappers supported is currently 3 with the 4th tag expected to provide an inline ad response. Chains longer than this number cannot be guaranteed for delivery or reporting accuracy.
*   Per the IAB specification, the wrapper ad tags may provide tracking events only, no additional assets may be delivered through the wrapper payload. This includes but is not limited to: ad parameters, or media files.

**Linear VPAID**

*   Ad selector
    *   Ad selectors must time out and select a default ad if no user interaction is detected. Furthermore, ad selector timeouts will count toward the maximum duration specified above and the sum of the timeout and the ad video may not exceed the max duration.
*   Countdown/time remaining
    *   The MSN player will provide a countdown to the user to indicate the time until the ad completes. VPAID ads must implement the adRemainingTime property and adRemainingTimeChange event to indicate changes to the player to ensure that the countdown is accurate and to avoid unexpected timeouts within the player from prematurely unloading the ad experience.
    *   Ads are discouraged from presenting their own countdown UI to avoid a poor user experience of displaying redundant information.
    *   Ads should similarly not force their content to the top -most z-index to hide the countdown and mini- control bar; this action will be periodically detected, and MSFT may opt to pull ads exhibiting this behavior.
*   Error Handling
    *   Per the IAB specification, all errors within the ad must not be raised to the player unless communicated through the adError event.
    *   Furthermore, ad errors encountered during specific IAB events (AdImpression, AdVideoStart, AdVideoFirstQuartile, AdVideoMidpoint, AdVideoThirdQuartile, AdVid eoComplete) should not prevent the player from receiving these events (for example, if the ad is detecting user behavior during these events and has an internal failure, the ad is still required to notify the player of the IAB events for proper tracking and metrics — ads failing to report properly may be pulled).
*   Expansion/interactive ad experience
*   Ads may enter into an interactive state (video is paused, and interactive content is shown in the player window) or an expanded state (ad content has exceeded the standard max duration at the user's explicit request for more information).
*   Entrance: Accessible only on click of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area or on hover of an interactive element not larger than 10% of the video area with a minimum 5 seconds of hover time and visible indicator of the impending action as the user is hovering (i.e. progress bar, decreasing clock wedge, numerical countdown, etc.)
*   Exit: Exit button must be clearly displayed and distinguished in the top-right hand corner of the video frame, with the smallest edge not smaller than 32px. Ads failing to comply with this requirement will be pulled or blocked from launch and vendors will be placed on certification review.
*   Z-index
    *   No z-index should be set by the ad. If one is required, the z-index value cannot exceed 100.
*   Leave behind content.
    *   Linear VPAID ads may not leave behind any content after the ad video completes. Once the ad completes, the VPAID ad will be unloaded, and all visual and non-visual objects must be removed and disposed.
*   Max Duration
    *   30s unless user explicitly chooses to enter into an interactive ad experience (see below for restrictions).
*   Resizing
    *   Ads must respond when the resizeAd() method is invoked; while a 16x9 ratio is expected, it is not guaranteed, therefore ads should scale their content appropriately and not rigidly adhere to one display ratio. Ads should immediately resize, when instructed, to avoid a poor user experience and to reduce display flicker.
*   Video click-through
    *   Ads can opt to process video click events on interactive elements as they see fit; however, the following requirements must be followed for standard video click-thrus and for any navigation to pages outside of the player window:
        *   If the video playback pauses on click, the ad must render a resume button over the video content so that the user can resume the ad and reach the content experience.
        *   The VPAID AdClickThru event must be raised for video click-thrus. If the ad opts to handle the click thru directly, the destination page must open in a new (non-modal) tab/window and must not replace the current window/frame.

_IAB VPAID 2.0 support limitations_

*   Only VAST 3.0 delivery is supported at this time (see related linear video spec for more details), it is important to note that skip functionality is not supported within the player. Therefore, if skip functionality is desired VPAID 2.0 should be used.

_VPAID vendor certification_

All VPAID vendors must submit test assets for certification prior for running VPAID ads on Microsoft Advertising properties. Please work with your account team representative to submit for VPAID vendor certification. VPAID vendors are expected to VAST deliver their VPAID ad content. If the VPAID vendor will also serve linear video through the same ad server to Microsoft Advertising, they should submit for both VAST and VPAID vendor certification. Otherwise, if the VAST payload is mostly static and does not vary by advertiser, only VPAID certification is required.

_VPAID Interface Requirements_

*   All functions and properties on the VPAID object interface MUST be present even if their return values are NULL or methods are not implemented.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the initAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must respond to the startAd() method call within a reasonable time or risk being unloaded due to a timeout. Timeouts can vary by player, but common limits are between 5-10 seconds.
*   VPAID ad must update the adRemainingTime property with the actual duration of the ad or clearly indicating an unknown value within the first second after the video start event.
*   AdStarted event and AdImpression event must fire as simultaneously as possible.

_Cross-domain data request_

Vendor ad servers, CDNs, and all server-side resources referenced in the VAST tag and VPAID ad must allow Microsoft & Microsoft partner domains (\*msn.com; \*.fwmrm.net; \*.s-msn.com) to access cross-site data via the following method:

*   CORS HTTP Headers: Server response headers must contain 'allow origin' CORS HTTP headers as documented at: http://www.w3.org/TR/access -control/#access-control-al low-origin-response-header. Allow origin headers can reply with a wild card or by echoing the source origin. Please refer to the w3 documentation for details on the benefits/risks for both options.
    *   Example CORS response header:  
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*

**Other third-party served ad policies**

_Discrepancy rates between ad servers_

Microsoft does not provide guarantees relating to 3rd party served discrepancies but will commit to investigate discrepancies that exceed accepted industry standard discrepancy rates.

_Server-to-server ad calls_

Microsoft does not currently employ server-to-server ad calls for vendor ad tags. Furthermore, it is strongly preferred that Microsoft provided ad tags for third-party sourced inventory are called directly from the client, however, server-to-server ad calls can be supported provided the following attributes are communicated to the MSFT ad server on the ad call (work with your account team to get specific query-string parameters for these attributes).

*   Client IP address
*   User agent

_Max tracking pixels per event_

While no hard limit is enforced on the MSFT properties, the maximum recommended number of tracking pixels per event is set at five (5). This limit is proposed to reduce risk of latent or dropped event tracking and ensure discrepancy rates within industry norms.

**Metrics & reporting**

The following events are supported across the video product portfolio for first-party and third-party served ads.

_Video events_

*   Play (impression)
*   Video click
*   First quartile
*   Midpoint
*   Third quartile
*   Complete
*   Pause
*   Mute
*   Unmute
*   Close
