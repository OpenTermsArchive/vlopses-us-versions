Our general ad requirements are designed to create a high-quality experience for our users, advertisers, and publishers. These guidelines ensure that advertisements are relevant, non-intrusive, and adhere to industry standards for content and presentation. By maintaining these standards, we foster a trustworthy environment where users feel safe and advertisers can effectively reach their audience.

Ads must:
---------

*   Ensure that the ad copy and landing pages comply with all [Microsoft Advertising Policies](#apex/ads/en/52023/1).
*   Be clear and factual.
*   Be distinguishable as an ad.
*   Not have misleading CTAs.
*   Not utilize language that implies urgency such as “do this immediately,” “supplies are running out,” “offer won’t last.”
*   Be legible and easy to read, with no interfering background, shadow, or glow.
*   Be clearly identified in the format appropriate for the ad served.

**Imagery**

*   Images must be high resolution and clear.  Images may not be fuzzy, obscured, or unreadable. Images must comply with our [Creative specs](#apex/ads/en/60207/0).
*   The image may not resolve in “image not available” or similar. 
*   Distorted or overly cropped images are not allowed. 
*   The image must be relevant to the product that is being promoted. 
*   Ads cannot appear to be part of the targeted site and imitate the look, feel or functionality (example: An ad on MSN should not look like an MSN featured story or have links that mimic editorial links).
*   Ads cannot have non-functional elements.
*   Ads that use standalone buttons as images that lack clear context explaining their function are prohibited.
*   Advertisers should use accurate brand or logos. For example, do not use old, outdated logos or logos that do not match the product or service advertised (for example image of a Windows Phone associated to a Microsoft Surface ad text).[Microsoft Advertising Intellectual Property policies](#apex/ads/en/60211/0) also apply.
*   In ads with multiple product and price offerings, offers and associated images must be consistent in quality, theme, and relevance to each other. 
*   Multiple disparate brands cannot be used in the same creative unless there is a brand partnership campaign.

**Animation**

*   No animation in-excess of 30 seconds or that exceeds creative file specs. (ex. maximum of 30 seconds for cycling of sequences/looping/repeat animation)- see the individual creative product specs. 
*   Animation including GIFs and similar files are not permitted in native ads.

**Audio**

*   Users must be in control of the audio experience, both within ad copy and landing page. A mute button or toggle must be present so users can re-mute. 
*   Audio must adhere to all other policies and content guidelines and must be appropriate for all Microsoft audiences.
*   For example: the use of racial or religious epithets, or language that advocates doing physical harm to people or their property, is disallowed based upon our defamatory, slanderous, libelous, or threatening content policy. 

**Video**

*   With the exception of CTV or streaming pre-roll ads, users must be in control of the video experience, both within ad copy and landing page.  Users must have the power to rewind, pause, forward, or mute the video.
*   Audio must be muted upon load. 
*   Visual indicators about the video length must be visible. 
*   Video content must be suitable for the targeted audience, query intent, or query for which it is served. 
*   All movie trailers must be rated for all audiences and include all required disclosures. 
*   Video ads must adhere to all other policies.
