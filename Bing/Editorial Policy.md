    *   Content considered click-bait such as gimmicky, sensationalized, or shocking language or images.
    *   Attention grabbing mechanisms and/or animation with the sole purpose of distracting the user. Some examples include: repetitive, rapid flashing, strobing or blinking tactics, and animated GIFs.
    *   Images, wording or phrases included solely to generate user's attention and increase click through. Examples include, “use this 1 weird tip”, “1 way…”. “kill stomach fat”, “don't buy car insurance”, “your auto insurer hates this”, “use this breakthrough…”, etc.
    *   Appear to make the ad landing page look broken or as if something is not working or what is considered to be normal on a web page.
    *   Impact performance: General impact on performance, reliability, and quality of the user's computing experience (e.g., slow computer performance, corruption of the operating system, or other issues).

        *   Examples include, if a user is able to select a specific state (such as Washington) from a dropdown list in an ad, the landing page experience must reflect the user's choice (such as mortgage rates specific to Washington State), static images of radio buttons, underlined text that appears to be a hyperlink but not actionable, or inactive selection boxes or dropdowns.
    *   Require users to enter personal information (i.e., name, email address, phone number) to view information within the ad or landing page.
