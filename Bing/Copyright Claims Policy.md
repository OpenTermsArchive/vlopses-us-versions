##### Note

To ensure consistency worldwide, Microsoft Advertising enforce our policies across our ad network using the English version. We provide translated versions as a courtesy to our clients, though the translations are not meant to change the content or meaning of the official policy language.

##### Important

This policy applies to Search. Adult is not allowed in other ad types.

##### Note

As an advertiser, you are responsible for ensuring that your keywords and ad content, including trademarks and logos, do not infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.

As an advertiser, you are responsible for ensuring that your keywords and ad content, including trademarks and logos, do not infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. We take allegations of trademark infringement seriously. Review our intellectual property policies below for details about trademarks, copyright, counterfeit goods and how to submit a complaint.

Please note that trademarks or other terms prone to nefarious tactics related to user safety may be proactively blocked to protect the network and our users. If your content is blocked for these terms, you may be asked to provide additional documentation/information upon appeal.

Terms and definitions
---------------------

*   **Counterfeit policy**: Concerns the actual product being sold or representation of the product in ad copy or landing page.
*   **Trademark**: Concerns the trademark used in text of the ad or keywords, as well as imagery contained in the creative.

Trademark owner
---------------

If a trademark owner is concerned that their trademark is being used improperly in ad text, imagery, or landing page, the owner should first contact the advertiser directly to address the issue. If dissatisfied with the outcome, the owner may also wish to contact Microsoft by completing the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2241148) for that market and select the option “Trademark Misuse in Ad Copy.” See “Trademark infringement investigations” below for more details.

Please note that Microsoft is not a mediator. As such, Microsoft encourages trademark owners to engage directly with advertisers who they believe are misusing their trademarks.

Trademark infringement investigations
-------------------------------------

Microsoft will investigate a complaint about trademark infringement in the text of a Search ad and will take appropriate action after it receives all required information. The investigation is designed to ensure the quality and accuracy of our ad results and to help our users avoid confusion.

*   Microsoft allows the fair use of trademarks in ad text, such as:
    *   Use of a trademark by a reseller of authentic goods or services.
    *   Informational websites about goods or services represented by the trademark, such as product reviews.
    *   Ordinary dictionary uses of a term.
    *   Comparative advertising (with restrictions).
*   Repeated use of trademark terms in a misleading way, including misleading ads created as a result of dynamic keyword insertion, may result in those trademark terms being blocked from use in your account.

Country restrictions: Select market Taiwan

Please select a market from the dropdown menu above.

**Ad and keyword investigations**

In addition to trademark infringement investigations, for the above markets, Microsoft will also investigate a complaint about trademark infringement in keyword use after it receives all required information via the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2241148). Advertisers may not bid on keywords, or use in the content of ads, any term whose use would infringe the trademark of any third party or otherwise be unlawful or in violation of the rights of any third party.

Use of a third-party trademark may be allowed if its use is truthful and lawful, for example, if:

*   Your website provides information—product reviews, for example—about goods or services that are represented by the trademark, and your principal offering is not any product or service that competes with the goods or services represented by the trademark.
*   You are clearly using the ordinary, dictionary use of a term, and your principal offering is not any product or service that competes with the goods or services represented by the trademark.
*   You are a reseller whose website sells authentic goods or services that are distributed under the trademark.

All other markets should submit a complaint about the use of a trademark in ad copy via the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2241148)

Counterfeit policy
------------------

Microsoft prohibits the advertising of counterfeit goods. A counterfeit good is one that copies without permission the trademark and/or distinctive features of a product in order to misrepresent itself as the genuine product or promote a nearly identical replica or imitation of the original product. Trademark or designer product brand names cannot be modified with “counterfeit,” “fake,” "replica," "copy of," "inspired by," “bootleg”, or any synonym thereof.

If you are a trademark owner and want to submit an allegation regarding the advertising of counterfeit goods, please complete the [Intellectual Property Concern Form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2241148). Upon receiving a sufficiently detailed complaint containing all required information, Microsoft will investigate and, if appropriate, suspend the account in violation of this policy.

Intellectual property rights
----------------------------

*   Ads may not infringe upon Intellectual Property (IP) rights of others. The use of logos, registered marks, copyrighted material etc., including use in images.
*   Advertisers represent and warrant that they possess all the necessary rights and authorizations in order to promote movies, songs, media or any other content which may be subject to proprietary rights of others. Microsoft is not required to pre-validate or vet advertisements at any time, or to resolve disputes on behalf of its customers. At times however, Microsoft may ask you for additional information related to your advertisements.
*   Advertisers are encouraged to maintain a DMCA compliant process, or local equivalent.

  Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines
==========================================

Thank you for helping us protect our trademarks and brand assets
----------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft is grateful for the trust that people place in our products, services, and experiences. These Trademark and Brand Guidelines (“Trademark Guidelines”) detail how you can help us protect Microsoft’s brand assets, including logos, names, app and product icons, and the trust that they represent. We have created these Trademark Guidelines to help clarify proper usage of our brand assets. Microsoft reserves the right to take action as necessary to protect them and, as a result, protect its customers and the public.

Microsoft’s brand assets—including the [Microsoft Trademarks (PDF)](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/mscle/documents/presentations/Trademark_List_FY26Q1.pdf) (as updated from time to time), logos, icons, designs, trade dress, fonts, names of Microsoft software, products, services, sounds, emojis, and any other brand features and elements, whether registered or unregistered (“Brand Assets”)—are proprietary assets owned exclusively by Microsoft and its group of companies. These Trademark Guidelines, which may be updated from time to time, detail how our Brand Assets can be used under specific circumstances. To help illustrate use cases, Contoso is used as the fictitious partner brand. **Many uses, including our logos, app and product icons, and other designs, will require a license first**. Unless you have an express license from Microsoft, these Trademark Guidelines will exclusively govern your use of our Brand Assets.  

### Examples of uses governed by these Trademark Guidelines

*   Don’t miss Contoso’s Memorial Day sale featuring a limited time discount on **Microsoft Excel** software.
*   The Contoso Game can be played on **Xbox** gaming consoles.
*   The Contoso App works with **Microsoft Teams**.

### Examples of Brand Assets requiring authorization from Microsoft

 

    

#### Microsoft logo

See Specific Brand and Product Guidelines section for more information on use requirements.

    

#### Microsoft logo lockups

These include logo lockups for flagship offerings, which are offerings that are aligned to and signal Microsoft’s long-term strategic intent. They include Microsoft 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Surface, among others. See Specific Brand and Product Guidelines for more information.

    

#### Microsoft product icons

These include app icons for products such as Microsoft 365, Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft Azure, and others. See Specific Brand and Product Guidelines section for more information.

App Guidelines  
 


----------------------

Without a license arrangement with Microsoft, everything about your app (including developer name, app name, logo, description, screenshots, and other app collateral) must be unique to you and free of Microsoft’s Brand Assets. The only exception is that you may truthfully state whether your app is compatible or interoperable with a Microsoft product or service within the text description about your app. If your app is integrated with a Microsoft technology, follow the guidelines for partner-led marketing under the Resources section below.

### Examples of approved app details

*   Developer: Contoso Developer, Inc.

*   App name: Contoso App

*   Image/screenshots: <No Microsoft Content Featured>

*   Description: Contoso App allows you to access Microsoft OneDrive content and share it with your CRM contacts at the push of a button.

### Examples of unapproved app details

*   Developer: Azure Development Co.

*   App name: Azure To Go

*   Image/screenshots: <Microsoft Logo, Azure App Icon Featured>

*   Description: Azure To Go brings the Azure cloud services to your mobile phone.

You may not use Microsoft’s Brand Assets in a manner that implies Microsoft published, developed, endorsed, is affiliated with, or is otherwise connected with your app. Furthermore, Microsoft’s logos, designs, and icons can never be used as your app icon and can only be used in your app advertisements with a license agreement in place.
