What happens when an ad policy is violated
==========================================

At all times during your use of the Microsoft Advertising services, you must comply with the Microsoft Advertising policies and the applicable laws and regulations in each of the markets where your ads serve.

Microsoft requires that all advertisers comply with the Microsoft Advertising policies. When ads violate Microsoft Advertising policies, we may apply one or more of our three enforcement impact types: ad and ad component level disapprovals, repeated violation strikes, or immediate account suspension.

Ad and ad component disapproval
-------------------------------

Ads and ad components are the individual elements that determine the appearance and timing of your ad. This includes all ad text, images, extensions, product feeds, product components, ad destination, keywords, and campaign settings.

If we determine that an ad or ad component violates our policies, we will disapprove the relevant ad or component. The disapproval message will specify the policy you have violated and how to address the issue through our appeals process.

In some cases, policy violations can put our users and platform at risk. Any ad or ad component that violates the categories outlined in the Repeated violations policy will face stricter enforcement penalties, based on the risk level at the time of detection. If an ad or ad component violates a policy warranting immediate suspension, we will take that action immediately upon detection, without considering any other disapproval or Strike penalty.

Repeated violations (Three strikes policy)
------------------------------------------

If an advertiser violates any policy, they are given a “strike.” An advertiser is allowed up to three strikes for policy violations within a given policy category before their Microsoft Advertising account is suspended. Policy categories group related policies under a common theme. These policy categories are linked below:

*   [Ad requirements](#apex/ads/en/60209/0)
*   [Disallowed content](#apex/ads/en/60208/0)
*   [Extensions](#apex/ads/en/60206/0)
*   [Intellectual property](#apex/ads/en/60211/0)
*   [Legal and privacy](#apex/ads/en/60212/0)

Immediate suspension of Microsoft Advertising services
------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Advertising is committed to a safe online environment. Egregious violations of our terms or policies warrant the immediate suspension of your advertiser account. We consider violations egregious if they that pose an immediate threat to the safety or security of our users or the services provided by Microsoft or its partners. These violations often indicate intent to use our service in a fraudulent, harmful, or illegal manner. If we detect an egregious violation, we will suspend your access to the service, including access to all information contained therein, immediately and without prior warning. We will notify you of the reason for the suspension with information on how to appeal the decision or address the concern. You will not be able to use Microsoft Advertising services until you redress the violation to our satisfaction.

Appeals
-------

You may appeal disapproved ads or components, any strike, or an immediate suspension by [contacting Support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371). within six months of the disapproval or suspension decision. If you redress the violation, we will lift all applicable penalties from your account.

Microsoft Merchant Center
-------------------------

All stores, and all products within the stores, uploaded into Microsoft Merchant Center must comply with the Microsoft Advertising policies, including the Product Ads policies. You can create only one store per top level domain.

Product disapprovals
--------------------

We will review each product upon upload in the Microsoft Merchant Center product feed. If a product is ineligible to serve because it does not comply with our policies, we will display that product in the Microsoft Merchant Center dashboard within the Microsoft Advertising Platform. We will not consider Microsoft Merchant Center product disapprovals when applying the Repeated violations policy.

Store disapprovals
------------------

We will disapprove your store when it violates the Microsoft Advertising policies. We will notify you of the reason for the disapproval via email and within the Microsoft Merchant Center dashboard. While the store is disapproved, none of the products within the store will be eligible to serve. Any store which violates the policy categories outlined in the Repeated violations section above, which includes Product ad policies, will be subject to more stringent enforcement penalties as determined by the level of risk at the time of detection. If a store is in violation of any policy which warrants immediate suspension, that action will be taken immediately upon detection without consideration for any other disapproval or strike penalty.

You may appeal disapproved ads or components, any strike, or an immediate suspension by [contacting Support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=2189081) within six months of the disapproval or suspension decision. If you redress the violation, we will lift all applicable penalties from your account.
