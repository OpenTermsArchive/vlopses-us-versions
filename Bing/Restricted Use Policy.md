*   Ads cannot contain, or combine text, and imagery in a manner that reasonably conveys sexually suggestive or provocative messaging.
*   Scenes involving suggestive undressing, like slipping off a bra strap or lowering underwear.
*   Images with an explicit focus on intimate areas. For example:

    *   Apparel with representations of genitalia, buttocks or female breasts, such as painted on realistic imagery of anatomy.
*   Lifestyle images of erotic lingerie, including accessories like garter belts, or items associated with bondage.

The following, while not the , may be suitable only for audiences that are ages 18+.

Ads such as the following must be presented in a tasteful manner with 18+ targeting:

*   Ad content featuring imagery of fine art (i.e. paintings or sculptures) that show nudity exposing intimate body areas.
*   Ads for books or movies with some level of limited nudity or suggestiveness, or books related to sexual health topics with educational intent.

Ad content featuring moderate skin exposure or contextual nudity is generally allowed but may be restricted depending on market sensitivities. Examples include:

*   A resort travel ad featuring a model in swimwear at the resort pool.
*   General, functional everyday swimwear or underwear.

##### Note

**Best practices:**

1\. What kinds of skin exposure may be acceptable in promotional content?

Partial nudity may be considered acceptable when the ad image is contextually appropriate and not sexual in nature.

2\. How to apply this policy consistently when interpretation may vary?

A helpful guideline is to consider the image as if it were a still from a film on pause, then ask the question "Is what’s about to happen next appropriate for a family audience?” If the answer is yes, the creative likely aligns with Microsoft standards.

DSA Qualified Researcher Program
================================

The DSA is a landmark regulation designed to foster a safer, more transparent digital environment in the European Union. Article 40 specifically empowers vetted researchers to request data from Bing, to support independent research into systemic risks and the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures in the EU online ecosystem.  

Under this framework, our Digital Services Coordinator of establishment (CnAM) will vet researchers and research projects. Once approved, Bing will provide access to datasets that are not publicly available, enabling deeper analysis of online trends, content moderation, and societal impacts. This process is designed to support public oversight and academic inquiry, while safeguarding user privacy and platform integrity. 

This page outlines: 

*   Instructions and templates for submitting dataset requests
    
*   Details on dataset structure, access format, and response timelines
    
*   Contact information for support and further inquiries
    

We encourage researchers to review the official [FAQs from the European Commission](https://algorithmic-transparency.ec.europa.eu/news/faqs-dsa-data-access-researchers-2025-07-03_en) for a comprehensive overview of the DSA’s provisions and to consult our instructions below for practical guidance on requesting Bing datasets.  

Data Catalog available to researchers across Europe
---------------------------------------------------

### Query Data Provided to Researchers 

Bing will provide information on the search queries that users have run on our platform. This data is intended to help researchers analyze online trends, content discovery, and societal impacts in the EU digital environment. 

**How it works:** 

Researchers must specify a topic of interest when submitting a data access request. This ensures that the dataset provided is relevant to their research goals. 

To further refine the dataset, researchers are encouraged to supply several example queries related to their topic. These examples help us identify and curate the most pertinent search data from our logs. 

The resulting dataset will include anonymized search queries, their frequency, and associated metadata (such as market and date), filtered to match the specified topic and example queries. 

**Why we recommend example queries:** 

Example queries allow us to accurately target the scope of your research and ensure compliance with privacy and relevance standards. 

They help us avoid sharing overly broad or unrelated data, making your analysis more meaningful and actionable. 

**What you’ll receive:** 

A structured dataset containing search queries that match your topic and examples, including:  

The query text 

Market (geographic region) 

Date of query 

The count (frequency) 

An example of what this data set would look like is: 

| Query | Market | Process Date | Query Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

How To Request the Data 
------------------------

Researchers can submit their request here: [DSA Data Access Portal](https://data-access.dsa.ec.europa.eu/home). Once the dataset request is submitted, Bing can provide Datasets on demand, specifying: Topic

*   Timeframe
    
*   Markets
    

Bing will curate datasets from Bing search and share when queries appear in logs a minimum of 50 times  to make the results relevant. 

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 
---------------------------------

### Who do I contact for more information? 

For any questions about the data access process, dataset details, or your request status, please contact our team at bing-researcher@microsoft.com. 

### What is the expected response time? 

Response times are determined by the order issued by the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment (CnAM). Once your request is submitted and approved, we aim to process and respond as promptly as possible, in accordance with regulatory requirements. 

How will I receive the data? 

Approved datasets will be provided in CSV format. You will receive a secure download link and a password separately to access your data. 

### Do you provide information on the results of queries? 

No, as part of this program, we do not provide information on the actual results that users see when running queries on Bing. The datasets we share contain only the queries themselves—such as the search terms entered, their frequency, and related metadata (market, date, etc.). 

The results displayed for any given query on Bing are publicly accessible to all users. Anyone can view these results by entering the same queries directly on the Bing search engine 

If you believe your research requires access to information beyond what is publicly visible in Bing’s search results or the schema above, please contact us at bing-researcher@microsoft.com. We will review your request and discuss whether additional support or data can be provided, subject to legal and privacy considerations. 

### Will you expand the catalogue over time? 

Our catalogue is shaped by the requests we have received to date and the information currently available within Bing’s systems.  

As we receive requests and learn from the research community’s interests and feedback, we may reevaluate. Our goal is to support meaningful research while maintaining transparency and responsible data sharing practices. 

If you have suggestions for new types of data or topics you would like to see included, please let us know at bing-researcher@microsoft.com.
