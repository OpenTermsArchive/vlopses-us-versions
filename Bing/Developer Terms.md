The party seeking protection must (i) give the other sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim; and (ii) give reasonable help in defending the claim.

### Section 12. Term and termination.

These TOU are effective upon your acceptance. Either party may terminate these TOU if the other party is in breach of any material term and fails to cure it within 30 days after written notice that describes the breach. In the event of termination by Microsoft due to your uncured material breach, all rights granted to you by these TOU will automatically terminate and you will cease to have any rights to use the Services and all unpaid amounts for Services delivered prior to termination automatically become due and payable.

### Section 13. Services updates.

We may change the Services at any time. Some changes to the Services may cause your Applications to stop working. Microsoft will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of material changes or updates to the Services.

### Section 14. Suspension

We may suspend your use of the Services if: (1) it is reasonably needed to protect the security of the Services, any third parties or any other Microsoft product or service; (2) you fail to respond to a claim under Section 11 within a reasonable time; (3) you do not pay amounts due under this agreement; or (4) you violate the terms of this TOU. If Microsoft suspends your use of the Services, Microsoft will suspend only to the extent reasonably necessary. Unless Microsoft believes an immediate suspension is required, Microsoft will provide reasonable notice before suspending the Services for the reasons stated above. We will give at least 30 days' notice before suspending for non-payment. If you do not fully address the reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate your access to the Services. We may also terminate your access to the Services if your use is suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.

### Section 15. Changes to the TOU.

We may update these TOU from time to time, and the effect of those changes will be governed by your Standard Terms, if any. We will notify you of any changes as provided by Section 16. If you do not agree to the changes, then you must stop using the Services. If you do not stop using the Services, then your use of the Services will continue under the changed TOU. In the future, we may choose to charge for all use of the Services or change the requirements for use free of charge. If we choose to change the fee requirements for the Services, Microsoft will provide notice of such terms as provided in Section 16, and you may elect to stop using the Services rather than incurring fees.

*   Prominently display Bing branding, consistent with the [Bing Trademark Usage Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks), near each point in the UX that offers a user the ability to input a search query. Such branding must clearly state to the user that Microsoft is powering the internet search experience.
*   Attribute each response (or portion of a response) displayed from the Bing Web Search, Entity Search, Image Search, News Search, Video Search, and Visual Search APIs to Microsoft, unless Microsoft specifies otherwise in writing for your use. This is described in [Bing Trademark Usage Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks).

**Do not:**

*   Attribute responses (or portions of responses) displayed from the Bing Custom Search API to Microsoft, unless Microsoft specifies otherwise in writing for your particular use.

### Transferring responses

Transferring responses

*   Transferred responses must:
    *   Consist of content that is unmodified from the content of the responses displayed to the transferring user. Formatting changes are permissible.
    *   Not include any data in metadata form.
    *   Display language indicating that a Bing Web, Image, News, Video, or Visual API response was obtained through an internet search experience powered by Bing. For example, you can display language such as \\"Powered by Bing\\" or \\"Learn more about this image on Bing,\\" or you can use the Bing logo.
    *   Display language indicating that a Bing Custom Search API response was obtained through an internet search experience. For example, you can display language such as \\"Learn more about this search result.\\”
    *   Prominently display the full query used to generate the response.
    *   Include a prominent link or similar attribution to the underlying source of the response, either directly or through the search engine (bing.com, m.bing.com, or your custom search service, as applicable).
*   You may not automate the transfer of responses. A transfer must be initiated by a user action clearly evidencing an intent to transfer a response.
*   You may only enable a user to transfer responses that were displayed in response to the transferring user's query.

Continuity of service
---------------------

Do not copy, store, or cache any data from Search API responses. However, to enable continuity of service access and data rendering, you may retain results solely under the following conditions:

### Device

You may enable a user to retain results on a device for the lesser of (i) 24 hours from the time of the query, or (ii) until a user submits another query for updated results, provided that retained results may be used only:

*   To enable the user to access results previously returned to that user on that device (for example, in case of service interruption).
*   To store results returned for your proactive query personalized in anticipation of the user's needs, based on that user's signals (for example, in case of anticipated service interruption).

### Server

You may retain results specific to a single user securely on a server you control, and display the retained results only:

*   To enable the user to access a historical report of results previously returned to that user in your solution. The results may not be (i) retained for more than 21 days from the time of the end user's initial query, and (ii) displayed in response to a user's new or repeated query.
*   To store results returned for your proactive query personalized in anticipation of the user's needs, based on that user's signals. You can store these results for the lesser of (i) 24 hours from the time of the query, or (ii) until a user submits another query for updated results.

Whenever retained, results for a specific user cannot be commingled with results for another user. That is, the results of each user must be retained and delivered separately.

### General

For all presentation of retained results:

*   Include a clear, visible notice of the time the query was sent.
*   Present the user with a button or similar means to re-query and obtain updated results.
*   Retain the Bing branding in the presentation of the results.
*   Delete (and refresh with a new query if needed) the stored results within the timeframe specified.

### Non-display URL discovery

You may only use search responses in a non-internet search experience for the sole purpose of discovering URLs of sources of information responsive to a query from your user or customer. You may copy such URLs in a report or similar response you provide:

*   Only to that user or customer, in response to that query.
*   Only if it includes significant additional valuable content, relevant to the query.

The previous sections of Search APIs use and display requirements do not apply to this non-display URL discovery use, except for the following:

*   Do not cache, copy, or store any data or content from, or derived from, the search response, other than the limited URL copying described previously.
*   Ensure your use of data (including the URLs) received from the Search APIs does not violate any applicable laws or rights of, or duties or obligations owed by you to, third parties.
*   Do not use the data (including the URLs) received from the Search APIs as part of any search index or machine learning or similar algorithmic activity. Do not use this data to create train, evaluate, or improve services that you or third parties might offer.

### GDPR compliance

With respect to any personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and that is processed in connection with calls to the Search APIs, Bing Spell Check API, or Bing Autosuggest API, you understand that you and Microsoft are independent data controllers under the GDPR.
