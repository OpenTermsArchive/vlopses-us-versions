You will not compromise or settle any claim in any manner, nor make any admission of liability, without Snap’s prior written consent, which Snap may provide in its sole discretion.

6\. Governing Law and Disputes

If you are contracting with any Snap entity other than Snap Inc., then the following applies:

These Business Services Terms are governed by the [Choice of Law](https://www.snap.comterms/?lang=en-US#sgl-choice-of-law) provision and the [Exclusive Venue](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#sgl-exclusive-venue) provision of the [Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-row).

If you are an entity, the [Arbitration](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration-row) provision of the [Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-row) applies to your use of the Business Services.

If you are contracting with Snap Inc., then the following applies:

The [Choice of Law](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#choice-of-law) and [Exclusive Venue](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#exclusive-venue) provisions of the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) apply to these Business Services Terms, as well as the Arbitration provision in Section 7 below.

**7\. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver**

THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS SECTION APPLIES IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH SNAP INC. (IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH ANY OTHER SNAP ENTITY, SEE THE [Arbitration](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration-row) provision of the [Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-row).)

a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 7 (the “Arbitration Agreement”), You and Snap agree that: (i) the [Arbitration](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) provisions of the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) do not apply to your use of the Business Services, and (ii) instead, all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Business Services Terms or the use of the Business Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis as set out in this Section 7, except that you and Snap are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.

b. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. Arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (https://www.adrservices.com/). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, and if they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

c. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.

d. Fees. ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/. 

e. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap.

f. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.

g. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 7.

h. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.

i. Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Snap Inc., Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out @ snap.com.

j. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap may bring an individual action in small claims court.

k. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snap.

8\. Limitation of Liability

YOU AGREE THAT THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IN THE [SNAP TERMS OF SERVICE](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) APPLY TO YOUR USE OF THE BUSINESS SERVICES, EXCEPT THAT IN NO EVENT WILL SNAP AND ITS AFFILIATES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS SERVICES (HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY, RESTITUTION, MISREPRESENTATION, OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE GREATER OF $500 USD AND THE AMOUNT YOU PAID SNAP FOR ANY PAID BUSINESS SERVICES UNDER THESE BUSINESS SERVICES TERMS IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

Your use of products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Business Services is at your own risk and is subject to the third-party’s terms. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Snap is not liable for any damages or losses incurred by you as a result of your use of those products or services.

Unless you’re contracting with Snap Inc., nothing in these Business Services Terms will exclude or in any way limit a party’s liability for fraud, death, or personal injury caused by its negligence, or any other liability to the extent such liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.

_In summary: Our limitations on liability in the Terms of Service apply in addition to the financial cap in these terms. We are not liable for losses caused by third parties._ _We do not exclude liability for things that cannot be excluded as a matter of law._

9\. Notices

Notices under these Business Services Terms must be in writing and sent: (a) if to Snap, to Snap Inc., 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, California 90405; with a copy to legalnotices@snap.com or Snap Inc., 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, California 90405, Attn: General Counsel; and (b) if to you, to the email address or street address you have provided via the Business Services, or by posting on the Business Services.

Payment Terms


-----------------

Effective: April 1, 2024

ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU ARE BOUND BY THE [ARBITRATION](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US#governing-law-and-disputes) PROVISION SET FORTH IN THE [BUSINESS SERVICES TERMS](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US). IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH SNAP INC., THEN YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

Introduction

These Payment Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap, govern payments for Business Services, and are incorporated into the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US). If the entity using the Business Services is acting as agent for another entity, then for purposes of these Payment Terms, “Advertiser” means that other entity. Some terms used in these Payment Terms are defined in the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US).

_In summary: These terms form a legally binding contract and govern payments from you to Snap for Business Services._

1\. Charges

a. All ads that run via the Business Services will be billed by Snap or its affiliates solely on Snap’s measurements unless stated otherwise. If you are billed by a Snap affiliate, any references to “Snap” in this section mean that affiliate. 

b. If an order via the Business Services is subject to taxes, fees, or charges, Snap may charge you for those taxes, fees, and charges in addition to the cost of the order (collectively, “Charges”), and you agree to pay the Charges at the rates in effect when incurred. If an order is subject to taxes (including value-added taxes or goods and services taxes) and you or Advertiser are required by Applicable Law to remit and report those taxes, you and Advertiser agree to remit and report those taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. If you or Advertiser are required to withhold or deduct any taxes, you will: (a) pay to Snap any additional amount necessary so that Snap receives a net amount equal to the Charges set forth in the applicable invoice; and (b) send to Snap on a timely basis and as Snap otherwise reasonably requests all official tax receipts or other documentation required by Applicable Law proving that you and Advertiser complied with the requirement to withhold or deduct those taxes.

c. If you are using the Business Services on behalf of an Advertiser, then if Snap requests, you will provide a valid VAT identification number or other tax identification number for Advertiser.

_In summary: All ads that run on Snap's Business Services are billed according to Snap's measurements unless stated otherwise. Snap may charge you for any applicable additional taxes, fees or charges. You and any relevant Advertiser must comply with all laws for remitting and reporting taxes. If you or an Advertiser need to withhold or deduct tax, you will pay Snap the full invoiced amount and send Snap any applicable tax receipts and any other documentation required by law._

2\. Payment

a. You authorize Snap and its affiliates to obtain credit reports on you and Advertiser from one or more credit bureaus. Snap may extend, revise, or revoke credit to you and Advertiser at any time in its sole discretion. If your or Advertiser’s credit is or becomes impaired, Snap may require payment in advance of any purchase via the Business Services or may disable your ability to purchase via the Business Services.

b. Invoice. If you elect to pay through your line of credit, as made available to you by Snap via the Business Services, Snap or its affiliates will send you an invoice for all Charges. You agree to pay all Charges within 30 days from the invoice date.

c. Prepay Ad Account. If you elect to purchase future ad space by adding funds to your Prepay Ad Account, all prepaid balances are non-refundable except where required by applicable law. After you add the funds and decide when to place the ads, Snap will deduct the Charges from your Prepay Ad Account balance as your ads run. Once your Prepay Ad Account balance is used up, the ads will stop running until you have added sufficient additional funds to your Prepay Ad Account balance. When you set up an ad account as a Prepay Ad Account, you will not be able to switch that ad account to another payment method.

d. Payment Card or Alternative Payment Method. If you elect to pay with a credit card, other payment card, or alternative payment method made available in the Business Services, you authorize Snap or Snap’s third-party payment processor or affiliate (as applicable) to charge that payment method for the Charges at Snap's convenience, including as early as at the time the order is submitted. Snap or its third-party payment processor or affiliate may run one or more payment authorization checks before the payment method is charged. Snap or its affiliate may update your payment information from time to time using a payment card updater.

You authorize Snap, its affiliates, or its third-party payment processor to store your payment information, as updated from time to time, and, if needed, to continue billing the payment method until the order for Business Services has been fulfilled.

If Snap does not receive payment from your payment card issuer, their agents, or from your alternative payment method, you remain obligated to pay Snap for any orders delivered, and agree to pay all amounts due upon request from Snap or its agents or affiliates.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ALL AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.

e. Sequential Liability. If you are using the Business Services as agent on behalf of an Advertiser, Snap may authorize sequential liability between you and Advertiser. In that case, Snap may hold you liable for the Charges solely to the extent that you have received the proceeds from Advertiser for each purchase you make on behalf of that Advertiser. Advertiser agrees to remit all Charges to you within the time period described above, and you agree to make every reasonable effort to collect and clear the Charges from Advertiser on a timely basis. For sums not cleared from Advertiser to you, Snap agrees to hold Advertiser solely liable. In the event Snap does not receive payment when due, Snap may immediately seek payment directly from Advertiser and Advertiser agrees to immediately remit such Charges directly to Snap.

Upon request from Snap, you must immediately provide Snap written confirmation of the relationship between you and Advertiser in a form agreed to by Snap. At a minimum, such confirmation must verify: (i) whether Advertiser has paid you the amount of the Charges in question; and (ii) that you are Advertiser’s agent and you are authorized to act on Advertiser’s behalf in connection with the Business Services. If you are not acting as authorized agent on behalf of Advertiser, sequential liability will not apply even if Snap otherwise authorizes.

f. Account Codes/Credits. Snap may on occasion provide a code, credit, coupon, or other form of discount in an amount and on terms and restrictions as provided by Snap. If you use a discount for a purchase via the Business Services on behalf of an Advertiser, and if required by Applicable Law, you will ensure the discount is granted to Advertiser and you will disclose the discount to Advertiser.

g. Past Due Amounts. If your payment method fails or an invoice becomes past due, Snap or its affiliates may take steps to collect past due amounts using collection mechanisms it deems appropriate and it may terminate any current or future purchase via the Business Services. You will pay all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) Snap or its affiliates incur in collecting any late payment of Charges.

h. Refunds. If you or Snap cancels an order via the Business Services before the order runs, Snap will issue a full refund of payments already made for that order to your original payment method, except that any Prepay Ad Account funds will not be refunded to the original payment method but will be left in your Prepay Ad Account balance. If you or Snap cancels an order while that order is running, Snap or its affiliates may provide a partial refund to your original payment method so that you only pay for the time the order ran.
