Click here for a helpful summary of the Snap Terms of Service

The [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) is a contract between you and Snap. It explains the rules for using Snapchat and our other services (which we call our “Services”). These rules are legally binding, so it's important to understand them. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key points, but you should still read the whole thing:

*   **You must be 13 (or older, depending on where you live) to use Snapchat**: And some of our other Services may require that you are 18 or older. 
    
*   **We collect and use your information to provide the Services**: See our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US) for details. 
    
*   **Our Services provide a personalized experience**: We show ads and recommend content based on your interests as explained [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?utm_source=web&utm_medium=tos&utm_campaign=personalization_opt_out&lang=en-US).
    
*   **You are responsible for your content and any activity that occurs under your account**: But we can change, limit access to, or remove that content. Don’t use or share anyone else’s content without their permission. And don’t use the Services to create or share any content that violates someone’s rights, including intellectual property or privacy. 
    
*   **Our Services include AI-enabled features:** These features use the inputs directed by you to generate outputs like content or responses, which may not be accurate or appropriate, so you use them at your own risk. All inputs and anything you generate using the AI features or ask the AI features to generate must comply with the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US). Outputs of our AI-enabled features are not Snap representations.
    
*   **You allow us to use your content to provide, improve, and promote our services**: Other users may also be able to view and interact with your content, depending on the feature and your settings. This includes content created using AI-enabled features.
    
*   **We don't have any control or responsibility over the content of others**: You might be exposed to content that is offensive, illegal, or inappropriate, but we have systems in place to try to remove harmful content which you can read about [here](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).
    
*   **You must follow Snap’s** [**Community Guidelines**](https://values.snap.com/policy/policy-community-guidelines?lang=en-US): These guidelines apply to all behavior, forms of communication, and content on our Services.
    
*   **You must also comply with Snap’s other acceptable use terms:** Among other things, you must not:
    
    *   create another account without our permission if we have disabled your old one;
        
    *   use the Services in ways we prohibit, like copying or trying to reverse-engineer our Services or any content on the Services without permission;
        
    *   use automated methods to extract data or content from our Services without our permission;
        
    *   do anything that could harm other users’ experience or the security of the services; or
        
    *   break any laws when using the Services.
        
    
*   **If you don’t comply with the** [**Snap Terms of Service**](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) **and the** [**Community Guidelines**](https://values.snap.com/policy/policy-community-guidelines?lang=en-US)**, your account may be suspended or terminated:** We may also notify third parties, including law enforcement, and provide them data from your account. You may also have to pay compensation if you cause damage to us or others. If you disagree with something we decide about your account or content, you may be able to challenge it as explained [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/18120518120340-How-to-Submit-a-Content-Appeal?utm_campaign=tos&utm_medium=web_snap&utm_source=web&lang=en-US) for content-related appeals and [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/17988958753684-How-to-Submit-a-Locked-Account-Appeal?lang=en-US) for account-related appeals. 
    
*   **Some features may be subject to additional legal terms:** If they are, we'll let you know and they will also become part of the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US). 
    
*   **Our Services are evolving over time we may not always notify you of every change**: We may also update the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) when needed, and will notify you of any significant changes.
    
*   **You use the Services at your own risk:** We don’t make guarantees about the quality, security, or availability of the services, and we’re not responsible for third-party content or services linked through the Services.
    
*   **There are limitations on our liability to you**: We’re not responsible for content or activities that aren’t ours. Where permitted by law, we also limit our liability for issues like not being able to access the Services, problems caused by others, or unauthorized use of your account.
    
*   **The** [**Snap Terms of Service**](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) **include something called an "Arbitration Clause" that explains how we will resolve most disputes.** This means that, except for certain types of disputes mentioned in the Arbitration Clause, disputes between us will be resolved by mandatory binding arbitration instead of a proceeding in court, and we both waive the right to participate in a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. Depending on where you live, this may not apply to you and you have the right to opt out of arbitration. The details are explained in the Arbitration Clause.
    
*   **If there is a dispute between us, the governing law will depend on the Snap entity providing the Services to you.** And nothing in the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) will affect whatever statutory rights you have as a consumer under any law that applies to you.
    
*   **We can restrict or terminate your access to the Services at any time**: You can also choose to stop using the Services or delete your account at any time. 
    

This summary simplifies the main points, but remember, the full [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) is the official agreement between us that governs your use of our Services.

If you live in the United States or if your principal place of business is in the United States, you are agreeing to the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#inc-terms).

If you live outside the United States or if your principal place of business is outside of the United States, you are agreeing to the [Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#sgl-terms).

Snap Terms of Service

Snap Inc. Terms of Service


------------------------------

Effective: April 7, 2025

Welcome!

We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you as a user of Snapchat, Bitmoji, or any of our other products or services that are subject to them, such as My AI, (which we refer to collectively as the “Services”). Our Services are personalized and we provide information about how they work in these Terms, our [Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub](http://values.snap.com/?lang=en-US), on our [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US), and within the Services (such as notices, consents, and settings). The information we provide forms the main subject matter of these Terms.

Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where they may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. (“Snap”). So please read them carefully.

By using any of our Services, you agree to the Terms. If so, Snap grants you a non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the Services in accordance with these Terms and our policies. Of course, if you don’t agree with the Terms, then don’t use the Services.

These Terms apply if you live in the United States or if your principal place of business is in the United States. If you live outside of the United States or if your principal place of business is outside of the United States, Snap Group Limited provides you the Services and your relationship is governed by the [Snap Group Limited Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#sgl-terms).

Where we have provided summary sections in these Terms, these summaries have been included for your convenience only and you should read these Terms in full to understand your legal rights and obligations.

**ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN** [**ARBITRATION CLAUSE**](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) **A LITTLE LATER ON. YOU AND SNAP AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS EXPLAINED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE.**

1\. Who Can Use the Services

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and you must confirm that you are 13 years or older to create an account and use the Services. If we have actual knowledge that you are under the age of 13 (or the minimum age at which a person may use the Services in your state, province, or country without parental consent, if greater), we will cease providing the Services to you and delete your account and your data. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all such terms carefully. By using the Services, you represent, warrant, and agree that:

*   you can form a binding contract with Snap;
    
*   you are not a person who is barred from using the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction — including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition;
    
*   you are not a convicted sex offender; and
    
*   you will comply with these Terms (including any other terms and policies referenced in these Terms, such as the [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Music on Snapchat Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/music-guidelines?lang=en-US), and the [Commercial Content Policy](https://www.snap.com/terms/commercial-content?lang=en-US)) and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.
    

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you represent that you are authorized to bind that business or entity to these Terms and you agree to these Terms on behalf of that business or entity (and all references to “you” and “your” in these Terms will mean both you as the end user and that business or entity). If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the U.S. Government, you agree to the [Amendment to Snap Inc. Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users](https://www.snap.com/terms/us-amendment?lang=en-US).

_In summary: Our Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 13 or the minimum age at which a person may use the Services in your state, province, or country if it is older than 13. If we become aware that you are under this age we will suspend your use of the Services and delete your account and data. Other terms may apply to our Services which require you to be even older to use them so please review these carefully when prompted._

2\. Rights You Grant Us

Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.

For all content you create using the Services, or submit or make available to the Services (including Public Content), you grant Snap and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyze, transmit, and distribute that content, including the name, image, likeness, or voice of anyone featured in it. This license is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. This license includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing and improving such Services.

We call Public Story submissions and any other content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles, Spotlight, Snap Map, or Lens Studio, “Public Content.” Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual right and license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed, for commercial and non-commercial purposes. This license applies to the separate video, image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained in your Public Content, as well as the name, image, likeness, and voice of anyone featured in Public Content that you create, upload, post, send, or appear in (including as reflected in your Bitmoji). This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your content, including videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name, image, likeness, or voice included in your content are used by us, our affiliates, users of the Services, or our business partners. For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US) and [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US). All Public Content must be appropriate for people ages 13+.

While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms or any applicable laws. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services.

We, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalized advertising based on the information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you. Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.

We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we will own all rights in anything we develop based on such feedback or suggestions.

_In summary: If you post content that you own to the Services, you remain the owner but you allow us and others to use it to provide and promote our Services. You also allow other users to view and, in some cases, use any content you make available to others on the Services. We have various rights to change and remove your content, but you always remain responsible for everything you create, post or share__, or direct us to use on the Services__._

3\. Additional Terms and Policies That May Apply

Additional terms and conditions listed on the [Terms & Policies](https://www.snap.com/policies?lang=en-US) page or that are otherwise made available to you will apply to you depending on the specific Services you use. If those additional terms apply (for example, because you use the applicable Services), then they will become part of these Terms, meaning that you must comply with them. For example, if you purchase or use any paid features that we make available to you on Snapchat (such as a Snapchat+ subscription, but excluding advertising services) you agree that our [Paid Features Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/paid-features?lang=en-US) apply. If any of the applicable additional terms conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will override and apply in place of the conflicting parts of these Terms.

_In summary: Additional terms may apply, please take the time to read them carefully._

4\. Privacy

Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is handled when you use our Services by reading our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US). You can also learn more about our privacy practices, including how certain features use your data, on our [Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub](https://values.snap.com/?lang=en-US).

5\. Personalized Recommendations

Our Services provide a personalized experience to make them more relevant and engaging for you. We will recommend content, advertising, and other information to you based on what we know and infer about your and others’ interests from use of our Services. It is necessary for us to handle your personal information for this purpose, as we explain in our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US). Personalization is also a condition of our contract with you for us to be able to do so, unless you opt to receive less personalization in the Services. You can find more information on personalized recommendations on our [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?utm_source=web&utm_medium=tos&utm_campaign=personalization_opt_out&lang=en-US).

_In summary: Our Services provide a personalized experience, including advertising and other recommendations to you based on data we collect as explained_ [_here_](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?utm_source=web&utm_medium=tos&utm_campaign=personalization_opt_out&lang=en-US) _and in our_ [_Privacy Policy_](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US)_._

6\. AI Features

Our Services include AI-enabled features (“AI Features”) that use inputs like text, images, audio files, videos, documents, data, or other content provided by you or used at your direction (“Inputs”) to generate content and responses based on those Inputs (“Outputs”). All Inputs and Outputs will be treated for the purpose of these Terms as content you submit to the Services and accordingly any rights and licenses granted to us and obligations on you in respect of content submitted or made available by you in these Terms applies to Inputs and Outputs, including the licenses set out in “Rights You Grant Us” above. We collect, use, disclose, and retain Inputs and Outputs in accordance with our Privacy Policy. 

While we integrate certain safeguards into AI Features, Outputs may not be reviewed in advance and may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, offensive, objectionable, inappropriate, infringing, unsuitable, unlawful, unfit for particular purposes, or the same or similar to content generated for other users of the Services. Outputs may also contain content inconsistent with Snap’s view, and Snap does not endorse any content included in any Outputs. If Outputs reference individuals or third parties including their products or services, it does not mean the individual or third party endorses Snap, or that they or these products are affiliated with Snap. 

AI Features and Outputs are provided as-is and made available to you without representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This means that your use of any AI Features and Outputs is at your own risk, and you should not rely on them for any purpose, including to make decisions or for professional, medical, legal, financial, educational or other advice. Outputs are not Snap representations.

When using our AI Features, unless we give our permission, you must not, and must not take any action that would reasonably be expected to: 

*   use Inputs that contain or make use of, and otherwise could reasonably be expected to generate Outputs that contain or make use of, content that you do not have permission to use, would violate the rights of others, or has otherwise been unlawfully obtained; 
    
*   violate any submission guidelines or other policies we make available to you that apply to your use of AI Features or submission of Inputs; 
    
*   direct AI Features to generate any Outputs in violation of these Terms, the Community Guidelines, or any applicable intellectual property right, contractual restriction, or applicable laws, or which might otherwise cause harm; 
    
*   alter, obscure, or remove any watermark or disclosure applied to Outputs by the AI Features; 
    
*   circumvent any safety or privacy features, safeguards, or mechanisms in the AI Features; 
    
*   use or share Outputs that will be used to train, develop, or fine tune models, services, or other AI technologies; or
    
*   misrepresent Outputs as having been human-generated or otherwise generated without the use of artificial intelligence.
    

Separate terms apply to any AI Features you use through or in connection with our business Services and Lens Studio instead of those set out above, and will be displayed to you in connection with your use of those other Services. 

_In summary: Inputs and Outputs from AI Features may be used in accordance with our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and terms relevant to the AI-specific products you use. AI Features may not be accurate or appropriate and you should not rely on them as a source of truth, facts, or substitute for human judgment._

  

7\. Content Moderation

Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the user or entity that submitted it. Although Snap reserves the right to review, moderate, or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not review all of it. So we cannot — and do not — guarantee that other users or the content they provide through the Services will comply with our Terms, [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or our other terms, policies or guidelines. You can read more about Snap’s approach to content moderation on our [Support Site](http://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).

Users can report content produced by others or others’ accounts for violation of our Terms, [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or other guidelines and policies. More information about how to report content and accounts is available on our [Support Site](https://values.snap.com/safety/safety-reporting?lang=en-US).

We hope you’ll understand any decisions we make about content or user accounts, but if you have any complaints or concerns, you can use the submission form available [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/18120518120340?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_snap&utm_campaign=tos&lang=en-US) or use available in-app options. If you use this process, your complaint must be submitted within six months of the relevant decision.

Upon receiving a complaint, we will:

*   ensure the complaint is reviewed in a timely, non-discriminatory, diligent and non-arbitrary manner;
    
*   reverse our decision if we determine our initial assessment was incorrect; and
    
*   inform you of our decision and of any possibilities for redress promptly.
    

_In summary: Most content on the Services is owned or controlled by others and we don't have any control or responsibility over that content. We have content moderation policies and processes in place that apply to content on the Services._

8\. Respecting the Services and Snap’s Rights

As between you and us, Snap is the owner of the Services, which includes all related brands, works of authorship, Bitmoji avatars that you assemble, software, and other proprietary content, features, and technology. The Services may also be covered by patents owned by Snap or its affiliates, including those listed at [www.snap.com/patents](https://www.snap.com/patents?lang=en-US).

You must also respect Snap’s rights and adhere to the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Bitmoji Brand Guidelines](https://www.bitmoji.com/bitmoji_brand_guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US), and any other guidelines, support pages, or FAQs published by Snap or our affiliates. That means, among other things, you may not do, attempt to do, enable, or encourage anyone else to do, any of the following and doing so may result in us terminating or suspending your access to the Services:

*   use branding, logos, icons, user interface elements, product or brand look and feel, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials Snap makes available via the Services, except as explicitly allowed by these Terms, the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Bitmoji Brand Guidelines](https://www.bitmoji.com/bitmoji_brand_guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US), or other brand guidelines published by Snap or our affiliates;
    
*   violate or infringe Snap’s, our affiliates’, or any other third party’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights, including by using the Services to submit, display, post, create, or generate any infringing content;
    
*   copy, modify, archive, download, upload, disclose, distribute, sell, lease, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, make derivatives of, or otherwise use the Services or the content on the Services, other than temporary files that are automatically cached by your web browser for display purposes, as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing, or as enabled by the Service’s intended functionality;
    
*   attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications, solicit login credentials from other users, or buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your account, a username, Snaps, or a friend link;
    
*   reverse engineer, make unauthorized copies or derivative works of, decompile, disassemble, modify or decode the Services (including any underlying idea, technology, or algorithm) or any content included therein, or otherwise extract the source code of the software of the Services, without our written permission, except to the extent an exception or limitation applies under an open source license or applicable laws;
    
*   use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, script, software, or other automated or semi-automated means, processes or interfaces to access, scrape, extract or copy the Services, including any user data, content or other data contained in the Services;
    
*   use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent;
    
*   use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services;
    
*   upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise, bypass, or circumvent the security of the Services;
    
*   attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access;
    
*   use the Services to create or develop a competing product or service;
    
*   state or imply that we endorse your content;
    
*   probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network;
    
*   violate any applicable law or regulation in connection with your access to or use of the Services; or
    
*   access or use the Services in any way not expressly permitted by these Terms or our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US).
    

_In summary: We own or control all of the content, features and functionalities of the Services, except your content. To ensure the Services and other users are protected from harm, there are rules we need you to follow when you use our Services. Failure to comply with these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account._

9\. Respecting Others' Rights

Snap respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights. When you submit content to the Services, you agree and represent that you own that content, or that you have received all necessary permissions, clearances, licenses, and authorizations in order to submit it to the Services (including, if applicable, the right to make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in any sound recordings, synchronize any compositions to any content, publicly perform any compositions or sound recordings, or any other applicable rights for any music not provided by Snap that you include in your content) and grant the rights and licenses contained in these Terms for your content. You also agree that you will not use or attempt to use another user’s account except as permitted by Snap or its affiliates.

Snap honors trademark, copyright, and other intellectual property laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and takes reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. If Snap becomes aware that a user has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to suspend or terminate the user’s account. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please report it using the form accessible through this [tool](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332110996?lang=en-US). Or you may file a notice with our designated agent: Snap Inc., Attn: Copyright Agent, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, email: copyright @ snap.com. Don’t use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be ignored. To report other forms of infringement, including trademark infringement, on the Services, please use the tool accessible [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332110996?lang=en-US). 

If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at [17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512?lang=en-US). That means the notice must:

*   contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
    
*   identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
    
*   identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material;
    
*   provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
    
*   provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
    
*   provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
    

_In summary: Make sure you own or have the right to use any content you make available on the Services. If you use content owned by someone else without permission, we may terminate your account. If you see anything which you believe infringes your intellectual property rights, let us know._

10\. Safety

We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that you will at all times comply with these Terms, including our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) and any other policies Snap makes available in order to maintain the safety of the Services.

If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to remove any offending content; terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and retain data relating to your account in accordance with our data retention policies; and notify third parties — including law enforcement — and provide those third parties with data and any other information relating to your account. This step may be necessary to protect the safety of our users and others; to investigate, remedy, and enforce potential Terms violations; and to detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.

We also care about your physical safety and wellbeing while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never use the Services while driving. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a Snap or to engage with other Snapchat features.

_In summary: We try to make our Services as safe as possible, but we need your help. These Terms, our Community Guidelines, and other Snap policies contain important information about how to keep the Services and other users safe. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way when using our Services._

11\. Your Account

To use certain Services, you need to create an account. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information for your account. You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to help keep your account secure is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account and to enable two-factor authentication. If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to [Support](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012305621908?lang=en-US). Any software that we provide to you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings. You agree not to create any account if we have previously removed or banned you or your account from any of our Services, unless we consent otherwise.

_In summary: Keep your account details safe and secure. Only use an account if you are authorized by us to do so._

12\. Memories

Memories is our personalized data-storage service. Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account. Since we can’t promise that your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of content you save to Memories. We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, or to prohibit certain types of content from being eligible for use with Memories, and we may change these limits and prohibitions from time to time in our sole discretion.

_In summary: Memories is a personalized storage service, it will be automatically enabled, but you can control some features. We cannot guarantee that any Memories will be stored forever either, so please do keep a backup._

13\. Data Charges and Mobile Phones

You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services. This includes data charges and charges for messaging, such as SMS, MMS, or other messaging protocols or technologies (collectively, “Messages”). If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.

By providing us with your mobile phone number you agree, among other things, to receive Messages from Snap related to the Services, including about promotions (where we have consent or as permitted by law), your account, and your relationship with Snap. You agree that these Messages may be received even if your mobile phone number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list, or international equivalent.

If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create an account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending messages intended for you to someone else.

_In summary: We may send you Messages, and mobile charges may apply when you use our Services._

14\. Third-Party Materials and Services

Certain Services may display, include, or make available content, data, information, applications, features, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”), provide links to certain third-party websites, or permit the use of Third-Party Materials or third-party services in connection with those Services. If you use any Third-Party Materials or third-party services made available through or in connection with our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), the applicable third-party’s terms will govern their relationship with you. Neither Snap nor any of our affiliates is responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under any third party’s terms. Further, by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Snap is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality, or any other aspect of such Third-Party Materials or third-party services or websites. We do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party services, Third-Party Materials, or third-party websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third-Party Materials, the availability of third-party services and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you.

_In summary: Snap isn't responsible for third-party features, content or services accessible via or in connection with our Services – please make sure you read the third party's terms._

15\. Modifying the Services and These Terms

We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time for any reason, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.

This also means we may need to update these Terms to reflect any changes to our Services or how we provide them, as well as to comply with legal requirements, or for other legal or security reasons. If those changes to these Terms are material we will provide you with reasonable advance notice (unless changes are required sooner, for example, as a result of a change in legal requirements or where we are launching new Services or features). If you continue to use the Services once the changes come into effect, we will take that as your acceptance.

_In summary: Our Services are going to evolve over time. We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect these changes or for other reasons._

16\. Termination and Suspension

While we hope you remain a lifelong Snapchatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time if you do not agree with any changes we make to these Terms, or for any other reason, by deleting your Snapchat account (or, in some cases, the account associated with the applicable part of the Services you are using).

We may restrict, terminate, or temporarily suspend your access to the Services if you fail to comply with these Terms, our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or the law, for reasons outside of our control, or for any other reason. That means that we may terminate these Terms, stop providing you with all or any part of the Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason. And while we’ll try to give you reasonable notice beforehand, we can’t guarantee that notice will be possible in all circumstances.

Where we restrict, terminate, or suspend your access to the Services for violation of our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), we will notify you and provide an opportunity for you to appeal as explained in our [Moderation, Enforcement and Appeals explainer](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).

Before we restrict, terminate or suspend your access to the Services, we will take into account all relevant facts and circumstances apparent from the information available to us, depending on the underlying reason for taking that action. For example, if you violate our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) we consider the severity, frequency, and impact of the violations as well as the intention behind the violation. This will inform our decision whether to restrict, terminate or suspend your access to the Services and, in the event of suspension, how long we suspend your access. You can find out more about how we assess and take action against misuse of our Services on our [Support Site](http://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).

Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap continue to be bound by Sections 2, 3 (to the extent any additional terms and conditions would, by their terms, survive), and 6 - 25 of the Terms.

_In summary: You can stop using the Services or delete your account at any time and for any reason, including if you don't like any changes to these Terms. We can restrict or terminate your access to the Services for the reasons set out above. When we do, we’ll provide you notice in most cases, as well as an opportunity to appeal the decision._

17\. Indemnity

You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services, or any products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Services, even if recommended, made available, or approved by Snap, (b) your content, including infringement claims related to your content, (c) your breach of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation, or (d) your negligence or willful misconduct.

_In summary: If you cause us some damage, you will compensate us._

18\. Disclaimers

We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY, (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS, OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.

NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR ASSUME LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH WE OR OUR AFFILIATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

_In summary: Snap will try to make the Services available to you, but we do not make any promises regarding quality and will not be liable for any content which is not ours._

19\. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES, (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

_In summary: We limit our liability for anything you do, instances where you cannot access the Services, things others do, and any issues resulting from unauthorized use of our Services. Where we are liable to you and you have suffered some loss, we limit our liability to a set amount._

20. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT YOU AND SNAP AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions.

a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 20 (the “Arbitration Agreement”), you and Snap, including Snap’s officers, directors, employees, contractors and vendors, agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services or any communications between you and Snap that are not brought in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Snap are not required to arbitrate any: (i) disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is an individual dispute and not a class action, (ii) disputes or claims where the only relief sought is injunctive relief, and (iii) disputes in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below. This provision shall be binding upon and enforceable against you, your estate, heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, including any party who is deceased at the time the dispute arises.

b. Informal Dispute Resolution First. We want to address any disputes without needing arbitration. If you have a dispute with Snap that is subject to arbitration, then prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“Pre-Arbitration Demand”) to Snap Inc., ATTN: Litigation Department, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405 so that we can work together to resolve the dispute. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is valid only if it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, (ii) your Snapchat username, (iii) your name, telephone number, email address and mailing address or the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any, (iv) a description of your dispute, and (iv) your signature. Likewise, if Snap has a dispute with you, Snap will send an email or text message with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address or phone number associated with your Snapchat account. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days of the date that you or Snap send your Pre-Arbitration Demand, arbitration may then be filed. You agree that compliance with this subsection is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, the party against whom an arbitration has been filed has the right to seek a judicial declaration in court regarding whether the arbitration should be dismissed for failure to comply with the informal dispute resolution process set forth in this subsection.

c. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process described above, you or Snap wishes to initiate arbitration, the arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) ([https://www.adrservices.com/](https://www.adrservices.com/?lang=en-US)). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM) ([https://www.namadr.com/](https://www.namadr.com/?lang=en-US)). The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties, to the extent permitted by law) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party's claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

d. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.

e. Fees. If Snap is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Snap will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are the party initiating an arbitration against Snap, you will be responsible for the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee. If, however, the amount of the Initial Filing Fee is more than you would have to pay to file a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (or, for cases where that court would lack original jurisdiction, the California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles), Snap will pay the difference between the Initial Filing Fee and the amount you would have to pay to file a Complaint in Court. Snap will pay both parties’ Administrative Fee. Otherwise, ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at [https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/](https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/?lang=en-US).

f. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap.

g. Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgement. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or Snap may serve a written offer of judgment on the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever is first, it shall be deemed withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs (including all fees paid to the arbitral forum) from the time of the offer.

h. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.

i. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. This subsection does not prevent you or Snap from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION THAT IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.

j. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.

k. Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action waiver still applies. You may not opt out of only the class action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Snap Inc., Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out @ snap.com.

l. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap may bring an individual action in small claims court.

m. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snap, including any revocation of consent or other action by you to end your participation in the Service or any communication with Snap.

_In summary: Unless you exercise your right to opt out, Snap and you will resolve all claims and disputes first through an informal dispute resolution process and, if that does not resolve the issue, on an individual basis using binding arbitration. This means that you cannot bring a class action suit against us in the event of a claim or dispute._

21\. Exclusive Venue

To the extent that these Terms allow you or Snap to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Snap agree that, except for a claim that may be brought in small claims court, all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Snap consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.

22\. Choice of Law

Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.

23\. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be removed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

24\. California Residents

If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

25\. Final Terms

These Terms, including the additional terms referenced in Section 3, make up the entire agreement between you and Snap, and supersede any prior agreements. These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver of our rights to enforce these Terms. We reserve the right to transfer our rights under these Terms and provide the Services using another entity, provided that entity upholds these Terms. You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

Snap Group Limited Terms of Service


---------------------------------------

Effective: April 7, 2025

Welcome!

We’ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you as a user of Snapchat, Bitmoji, or any of our other products or services that are subject to them, such as My AI, (which we refer to collectively as the “Services”). Our Services are personalised and we provide information about how they work in these Terms, our [Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub](http://values.snap.com/?lang=en-US), on our [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US), and within the Services (such as notices, consents, and settings). The information we provide forms the main subject matter of these Terms.

Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where they may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Group Limited (“Snap”). So please read them carefully.

In order to use our Services, you must accept these Terms (and any other notice or consent), which are presented to you when you first open the Service. If so, Snap grants you a non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable licence to use the Services in accordance with these Terms and our policies. Of course, if you don’t accept them, then don’t use the Services.

These Terms apply if you live outside the United States or if your principal place of business is outside of the United States. If you live in the United States or if your principal place of business is in the United States, Snap Inc. provides you the Services and your relationship is governed by the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#inc-terms).

Where we have provided summary sections in these Terms, these summaries have been included for your convenience only and you should read these Terms in full to understand your legal rights and obligations.

ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU’RE USING THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A BUSINESS, THEN YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT APPEARS LATER IN THESE TERMS.

1\. Who Can Use the Services

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and you must confirm that you are 13 years or older to create an account and use the Services. If we have actual knowledge that you are under the age of 13 (or the minimum age at which a person may use the Services in your state, province or country without parental consent, if greater), we will cease providing the Services to you and delete your account and your data. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all such terms carefully. By using the Services, you confirm that (and represent and warrant that):

*   you can form a binding contract with Snap;
    
*   you are not a person who is barred from using the Services under the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom, or any other applicable jurisdiction — including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition;
    
*   you are not a convicted sex offender; and
    
*   you will comply with these Terms (including any other terms and policies referenced in these Terms, such as the [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Music on Snapchat Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/music-guidelines?lang=en-US), and the [Commercial Content Policy](https://www.snap.com/terms/commercial-content?lang=en-US)) and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.
    

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you confirm that you are authorised to bind that business or entity to these Terms and you agree to these Terms on behalf of that business or entity (and all references to “you” and “your” in these Terms will mean both you as the end user and that business or entity).

_In summary: Our Services are not directed at anyone under the age of 13 or the minimum age at which a person may use the Services in your state, province or country if it is older than 13. If we become aware that you are under this age we will suspend your use of the Services and delete your account and data. Other terms may apply to our Services which require you to be even older to use them so please review these carefully when prompted._

2\. Rights You Grant Us

Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a licence to use that content. How broad that licence is depends on which Services you use and the settings you have selected.

For all content you create using the Services, or submit or make available to the Services (including Public Content), you grant Snap and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free (meaning that there is no ongoing payment to you required), sublicencable, and transferable licence to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyse, transmit, and distribute that content, including the name, image, likeness, or voice of anyone featured in it. This licence is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones. This licence includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing and improving such Services.

We call Public Story submissions and any other content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles, Spotlight, Snap Map, or Lens Studio, “Public Content.” Because Public Content is inherently public, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners a worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable right and licence to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronise, overlay graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of your Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed. This licence applies to the separate video, image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained in your Public Content, as well as the name, image, likeness, and voice of anyone featured in Public Content that you create, upload, post, send, or appear in (including as reflected in your Bitmoji). This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your content, including videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name, image, likeness, or voice included in your content are used by us, our affiliates, users of the Services, or our business partners. The licences granted by you for Public Content continue for so long as the Public Content is on the Services and for a reasonable period of time after you remove or delete the Public Content from the Services (provided we may retain server copies of your Public Content indefinitely). For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US) and [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US). All Public Content must be appropriate for people ages 13+.

To the extent permissible by law, you irrevocably waive — or agree not to assert against Snap or its affiliates — any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in content you share on the Services throughout the world.

While we’re not required to do so, we reserve the right to access, review, screen, and delete any content: (i) which we think violates these Terms or any applicable laws, including any additional terms referenced in Section 3, or our policies, such as our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), or (ii) if necessary to comply with our legal obligations. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services.

We, Snap Inc., our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including personalised advertising — with your consent, where required — based on the information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you. Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.

We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we will own all rights in anything we develop based on such feedback or suggestions.

_In summary: If you post content that you own to the Services, you remain the owner but you allow us and others to use it to provide and promote our Services. You also allow other users to view and, in some cases, use any content you make available to others on the Services. We have various rights to change and remove your content, but you always remain responsible for everything you create, post or share, or direct us to use on the Services._

3\. Additional Terms and Policies That May Apply

Additional terms and conditions listed on the [Snap Terms & Policies](https://www.snap.com/policies?lang=en-US) page or that are otherwise made available to you will apply to you depending on the specific Services you use or where you are located. If those additional terms apply (for example, because you use the applicable Services) then they will then become part of these Terms, meaning that you must comply with them. For example, if you purchase or use any paid features that we make available to you on Snapchat (such as a Snapchat+ subscription, but excluding advertising services) you agree that our [Paid Features Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/paid-features?lang=en-US) apply. If any of the applicable additional terms conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will override and apply in place of the conflicting parts of these Terms.

_In summary: Additional terms may apply, please take the time to read them carefully._

4\. Privacy

Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is handled when you use our Services by reading our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US). You can also learn more about our privacy practices, including how certain features use your data, on our [Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub](https://values.snap.com/?lang=en-US).

5\. Personalised Recommendations

Our Services provide a personalised experience to make them more relevant and engaging for you. We will recommend content, advertising and other information to you based on what we know and infer about your and others’ interests from use of our Services. It is necessary for us to handle your personal information for this purpose, as we explain in our [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US). Personalisation is also a condition of our contract with you for us to be able to do so, unless you opt to receive less personalisation in the Services. You can find more information on personalised recommendations on our [Support Site](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?utm_source=web&utm_medium=tos&utm_campaign=personalization_opt_out&lang=en-US).

_In summary: Our Services provide a personalised experience, including advertising and other recommendations to you based on data we collect as explained_ [_here_](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/17338132910484?utm_source=web&utm_medium=tos&utm_campaign=personalization_opt_out&lang=en-US) _and in our_ [_Privacy Policy_](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US)_._

6\. AI Features

Our Services include AI-enabled features (“AI Features”) that use inputs like text, images, audio files, videos, documents, data, or other content provided by you or used at your direction (“Inputs”) to generate content and responses based on those Inputs (“Outputs”). All Inputs and Outputs will be treated for the purpose of these Terms as content you submit to the Services and accordingly any rights and licences granted to us and obligations on you in respect of content submitted or made available by you in these Terms applies to Inputs and Outputs, including the licences set out in “Rights You Grant Us” above. We collect, use, disclose, and retain Inputs and Outputs in accordance with our Privacy Policy. 

While we integrate certain safeguards into AI Features, Outputs may not be reviewed in advance and may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, offensive, objectionable, inappropriate, infringing, unsuitable, unlawful, unfit for particular purposes, or the same or similar to content generated for other users of the Services. Outputs may also contain content inconsistent with Snap’s view, and Snap does not endorse any content included in any Outputs. If Outputs reference individuals or third parties including their products or services, it does not mean the individual or third party endorses Snap, or that they or these products are affiliated with Snap. 

AI Features and Outputs are provided as-is and made available to you without representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This means that your use of any AI Features and Outputs is at your own risk, and you should not rely on them for any purpose, including to make decisions or for professional, medical, legal, financial, educational or other advice. Outputs are not Snap representations.

When using our AI Features, unless we give our permission, you must not, and must not take any action that would reasonably be expected to: 

*   use Inputs that contain or make use of, and otherwise could reasonably be expected to generate Outputs that contain or make use of, content that you do not have permission to use, would violate the rights of others, or has otherwise been unlawfully obtained; 
    
*   violate any submission guidelines or other policies we make available to you that apply to your use of AI Features or submission of Inputs; 
    
*   direct AI Features to generate any Outputs in violation of these Terms, the Community Guidelines, or any applicable intellectual property right, contractual restriction, or applicable laws, or which might otherwise cause harm; 
    
*   alter, obscure, or remove any watermark or disclosure applied to Outputs by the AI Features; 
    
*   circumvent any safety or privacy features, safeguards, or mechanisms in the AI Features; 
    
*   use or share Outputs that will be used to train, develop, or fine tune models, services, or other AI technologies; or
    
*   misrepresent Outputs as having been human-generated or otherwise generated without the use of artificial intelligence.
    

Separate terms apply to any AI Features you use through or in connection with our business Services and Lens Studio instead of those set out above, and will be displayed to you in connection with your use of those other Services. 

_In summary: Inputs and Outputs from AI Features may be used in accordance with our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and terms relevant to the AI-specific products you use. AI Features may not be accurate or appropriate and you should not rely on them as a source of truth, facts, or substitute for human judgment._ 

7\. Content Moderation

Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the user or entity that submitted it. Although Snap reserves the right to review, moderate, or remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not review all of it. So we cannot — and do not — guarantee that other users or the content they provide through the Services will comply with our Terms, [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or our other terms, policies or guidelines. You can read more about Snap’s approach to content moderation on our [Support Site](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).

Users can report content produced by others or others’ accounts for violation of our Terms, [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or other guidelines and policies. More information about how to report content and accounts is available on our [Support Site](https://values.snap.com/safety/safety-reporting?lang=en-US).

We hope you’ll understand any decisions we make about content or user accounts, but if you have any complaints or concerns you can use the submission form available [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/18120518120340?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_snap&utm_campaign=tos&lang=en-US) or use available in-app options. If you use this process, your complaint must be submitted within six months of the relevant decision.

Upon receiving a complaint, we will:

*   ensure the complaint is reviewed in a timely, non-discriminatory, diligent and non-arbitrary manner;
    
*   reverse our decision if we determine our initial assessment was incorrect; and
    
*   inform you of our decision and of any possibilities for redress promptly.
    

_In summary: Most content on the Services is owned or controlled by others and we don't have any control or responsibility over that content. We have content moderation policies and processes in place that apply to content on the Services._

8\. Respecting the Services and Snap’s Rights

As between you and us, Snap is the owner of the Services, which includes all related brands, works of authorship, Bitmoji avatars that you assemble, software, and other proprietary content, features, and technology. The Services may also be covered by patents owned by Snap or its affiliates, including those listed at [www.snap.com/patents](https://www.snap.com/patents?lang=en-US).

You must also respect Snap’s rights and adhere to the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Bitmoji Brand Guidelines](https://www.bitmoji.com/bitmoji_brand_guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US), and any other guidelines, support pages, or FAQs published by Snap or our affiliates. That means, among other things, you may not do, attempt to do, enable, or encourage anyone else to do, any of the following and doing so may result in us terminating or suspending your access to the Services:

*   use branding, logos, icons, user interface elements, product or brand look and feel, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials Snap makes available via the Services, except as explicitly allowed by these Terms, the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Bitmoji Brand Guidelines](https://www.bitmoji.com/bitmoji_brand_guidelines.pdf?lang=en-US) or other brand guidelines published by Snap or our affiliates;
    
*   violate or infringe Snap’s, our affiliates’ or any other third party’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights, including by using the Services to submit, display, post, create or generate any infringing content;
    
*   copy, modify, archive, download, upload, disclose, distribute, sell, lease, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, make derivatives of, or otherwise use the Services or the content on the Services, other than temporary files that are automatically cached by your web browser for display purposes, as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing, or as enabled by the Service’s intended functionality;
    
*   attempt to access the Services through unauthorised third-party applications, solicit login credentials from other users, or buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your account, a username, Snaps, or a friend link;
    
*   reverse engineer, make unauthorised copies or derivative works of, decompile, disassemble, modify or decode the Services (including any underlying idea or algorithm) or any content included therein, or otherwise extract the source code of the software of the Services, without our written permission, except to the extent an exception or limitation applies under an open source license or applicable laws;
    
*   use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, script, software, or other automated or semi-automated means, processes or interfaces to access, scrape, extract or copy the Services, including any user data, content or other data contained in the Services;
    
*   use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users’ content or information without our written consent;
    
*   use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services;
    
*   upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise, bypass, or circumvent the security of the Services;
    
*   attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorised to access;
    
*   use the Services to create or develop a competing product or service;
    
*   state or imply that we endorse your content;
    
*   probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network;
    
*   violate any applicable law or regulation in connection with your access to or use of the Services; or
    
*   access or use the Services in any way not expressly permitted by these Terms or our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US).
    

_In summary: We own or control all of the content, features and functionalities of the Services, except your content. To ensure the Services and other users are protected from harm, there are rules we need you to follow when you use our Services. Failure to comply with these rules may result in suspension or termination of your account._

9\. Respecting Others' Rights

Snap respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that violates or infringes someone else’s rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right. When you submit content to the Services, you are solely responsible for ensuring and must ensure that you own that content, or that you have received all necessary permissions, clearances, licences, and authorisations in order to submit it to the Services (including, if applicable, the right to make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in any sound recordings, synchronise any compositions to any content, publicly perform any compositions or sound recordings, or any other applicable rights for any music not provided by Snap that you include in your content) and grant the rights and licences contained in these Terms for your content. You also agree that you will not use or attempt to use another user’s account except as permitted by Snap or its affiliates.

Snap honours trademark, copyright, and other intellectual property laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and takes reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. If Snap becomes aware that a user has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to suspend or terminate the user’s account. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please report it using the form accessible through this [tool](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332110996?lang=en-US). Or you may file a notice with our designated agent: Snap Inc., Attn: Copyright Agent, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, email: copyright @ snap.com. Don’t use this email address for anything other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be ignored. To report other forms of infringement, including trademark infringement, on the Services, please use the tool accessible [here](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332110996?lang=en-US). If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must:

*   contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
    
*   identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
    
*   identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material;
    
*   provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
    
*   provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
    
*   provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
    

_In summary: Make sure you own or have the right to use any content you make available on the Services. If you use content owned by someone else without permission, we may terminate your account. If you see anything which you believe infringes your intellectual property rights, let us know._

10\. Safety

We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can’t guarantee it. That’s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that you will at all times comply with these Terms, including our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) and any other policies Snap makes available in order to maintain the safety of the Services.

If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to remove any offending content; terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and retain data relating to your account in accordance with our data retention policies; and notify third parties — including law enforcement — and provide those third parties with data and any other information relating to your account. This step may be necessary to protect the safety of our users, and others, to investigate, remedy, and enforce potential Terms violations, and to detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.

We also care about your physical safety and wellbeing while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never use the Services while driving. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way just to capture a Snap or to engage with other Snapchat features.

_In summary: We try to make our Services as safe as possible, but we need your help. These Terms, our Community Guidelines and other Snap policies contain important information about how to keep the Services and other users safe. And never put yourself or others in harm’s way when using our Services._

11\. Your Account

To use certain Services, you need to create an account. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information for your account. Except in the unlikely event that activity occurs in your account outside of your control, you are responsible for any activity that occurs in your account. So it’s important that you keep your account secure. One way to help keep your account secure is to select a strong password that you don’t use for any other account and to enable two-factor authentication. If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately reach out to [Support](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012305621908?lang=en-US). Any software that we provide to you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings. You agree not to create any account if we have previously removed or banned you or your account from any of our Services, unless we consent otherwise.

_In summary: Keep your account details safe and secure. Only use an account if you are authorised by us to do so._

12\. Memories

Memories is our personalised data-storage service. Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on our end to terminate your account. Since we can’t promise that your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate copy of content you save to Memories. We make no promise that Memories will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the right to set storage limits for Memories, or to prohibit certain types of content from being eligible for use with Memories and we may change these limits from time to time in our sole discretion.

_In summary: Memories is a personalised storage service, it will be automatically enabled, but you can control some features. We cannot guarantee that any Memories will be stored forever either, so please do keep a backup._

13\. Data Charges and Mobile Phones

You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services. This includes data charges and charges for messaging, such as SMS, MMS, or other messaging protocols or technologies (collectively, “Messages”). If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.

By providing us with your mobile phone number you agree, among other things, to receive Messages from Snap related to the Services, including about promotions (where we have consent or as permitted by law), your account, and your relationship with Snap. These Messages may be received even if your mobile phone number is registered on any kind of “Do Not Call” list, or international equivalent.

If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create an account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending messages intended for you to someone else.

_In summary: We may send you Messages, and mobile charges may apply when you use our Services._

14\. Third-Party Materials and Services

Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications, features or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”), provide links to certain third-party websites or permit the use of Third-Party Materials or third-party services in connection with them. If you use any Third-Party Materials or third-party services made available through or in connection with our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), the applicable third-party’s terms will govern their relationship with you. Neither Snap nor any of our affiliates is responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under any third party’s terms. Further, by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Snap is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third-Party Materials or third-party services or websites. We do not provide any assurances or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party services, Third-Party Materials or third-party websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third-Party Materials, the availability of third-party services and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you.

_In summary: Snap isn't responsible for third party features, content or services accessible via or in connection with our Services – please make sure you read the third party's terms._

15\. Modifying the Services and These Terms

We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities over time, and we may also suspend, stop or terminate the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we will try to notify you beforehand — but this won’t always be possible.

This also means we may need to update these Terms to reflect any changes to our Services or how we provide them, as well as to comply with legal requirements, or for other legal or security reasons. If those changes to these Terms are material we will provide you with reasonable advance notice (unless changes are required sooner, for example, as a result of a change in legal requirements or where we are launching new Services or features). If you continue to use the Services once the changes come into effect, we will take that as your acceptance.

_In summary: Our Services are going to evolve over time. We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect these changes or for other reasons._

16\. Termination and Suspension

While we hope you remain a lifelong Snapchatter, you can terminate these Terms at any time if you do not agree with any changes we make to these Terms, or for any other reason, by deleting your Snapchat account (or, in some cases, the account associated with the applicable part of the Services you are using).

We may restrict, terminate, or temporarily suspend your access to the Services if you fail to comply with these Terms, our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or the law, for reasons outside of our control, or for any other reason. That means that we may terminate these Terms, stop providing you with all or any part of the Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason. And while we’ll try to give you reasonable notice beforehand, we can’t guarantee that notice will be possible in all circumstances.

Where we restrict, terminate or suspend your access to the Services for violation of our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), we will notify you and provide an opportunity for you to appeal as explained in our [Moderation, Enforcement and Appeals explainer](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).

Before we restrict, terminate or suspend your access to the Services, we will take into account all relevant facts and circumstances apparent from the information available to us, depending on the underlying reason for taking that action. For example, if you violate our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) we consider the severity, frequency, and impact of the violations as well as the intention behind the violation. This will inform our decision whether to restrict, terminate or suspend your access to the Services and, in the event of suspension, how long we suspend your access. You can find out more about how we assess and take action against misuse of our Services on our [Support Site](http://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US).

Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snap continue to be bound by Sections 2, 3 (to the extent any additional terms and conditions would, by their terms, survive), and 6 - 24 of the Terms.

_In summary: You can stop using the Services or delete your account at any time and for any reason, including if you don't like any changes to these Terms. We can restrict or terminate your access to the Services for the reasons set out above. When we do, we’ll provide you notice in most cases, as well as an opportunity to appeal the decision._

17\. Indemnity

You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services, (b) your content, including infringement claims related to your content, (c) your breach of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation, or (d) your negligence or intentional misconduct.

_In summary: If you cause us some damage, you will compensate us._

18\. Disclaimers

We will try hard to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available” and to the extent permitted by law and except as stated above, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, in particular implied warranties, conditions, or other terms relating to: (a) merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, non-infringement, or (b) arising from a course of dealing. In addition, while we attempt to provide a good user experience, we do not represent or warrant that: (i) the Services will always be entirely secure, error-free or timely, (ii) the Services will always function without delays, disruption or imperfections, or (iii) any content or information you obtain through the Services will always be timely or accurate.

IF THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CLAUSE, THOSE EXCLUSIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Snap, Snap Inc., and our affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability for any content that you, another user, or a third party creates, uploads, posts, sends, receives, views, or stores on or through our Services and you understand and agree that you may be exposed to content that might be offensive, illegal, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate, none of which Snap, Snap Inc., nor our affiliates will be responsible for.

Nothing in these Terms will exclude or limit any responsibility we may have to remove content if so required by the law of the country where you live.

_In summary: Snap will try to make the Services available to you, but we do not make any promises regarding quality and will not be liable for any content which is not ours._

19\. Limitation of Liability

Snap, Snap Inc., and our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, suppliers, and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or multiple damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill or other intangible losses, resulting from: (a) your use of the Services or inability to use the Services, (b) your access to or inability to access the Services, (c) the conduct or content of other users or third parties on or through the Services, or (d) unauthorised access, use or alteration of your content. Except to the extent specified otherwise in any other applicable terms of Snap, Snap Inc., or our affiliates, in no event will Snap, Snap Inc., or our affiliates’ aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Services exceed the greater of (a) €100 EUR, and (b) the amount you paid Snap in the last 12 months for any Services.

Nothing in these Terms (or for the avoidance of doubt any other terms to which you are subject in respect of the provision of Services by Snap Snap Inc., or our affiliates) shall exclude or limit Snap’s, Snap Inc.’s, or our affiliates’ liability for: (a) death or personal injury arising from their own respective intent or negligence, (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or (c) any other liability to the extent that such liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.

IF THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE DOES NOT ALLOW ANY LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CLAUSE, THAT LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED.

FURTHER, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS AFFECTS YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER.

_In summary: We limit our liability for anything you do, instances where you cannot access the Services, things others do and any issues resulting from unauthorised use of our Services. Where we are liable to you and you have suffered some loss, we limit our liability to a set amount._

20\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

If you have a concern, let’s talk. Go ahead and [contact us](https://help.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US) first and we’ll do our best to resolve the issue.

Some of our Services may have additional terms that contain dispute resolution provisions unique to that Service or your residency.

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business (rather than for your personal use), you and Snap agree that to the extent permitted by law, all claims and disputes between us arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services will be finally settled through binding arbitration under the [LCIA Arbitration Rules](http://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2014.aspx?lang=en-US), which are incorporated by reference into this clause. There will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the LCIA), the arbitration will take place in London, and the arbitration will be conducted in English. If you do not wish to agree to this clause, you must not use the Services.

_In summary: Get in touch with us if you have a complaint. Disputes with business users will be settled through arbitration._

21\. Exclusive Venue

To the extent that these Terms allow you or Snap to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Snap agree that all claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise), arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of England in the United Kingdom, unless this is prohibited by the laws of the country where you reside. You and Snap consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.

22\. Choice of Law

The laws of England and Wales govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter. The courts in some countries may not apply the laws of England and Wales to some disputes related to these Terms. If you reside in one of those countries, the laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.

23\. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be removed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

24\. Final Terms

These Terms, including the additional terms referenced in Section 3, make up the entire agreement between you and Snap, and supersede any prior agreements. These Terms do not create or confer any rights to third parties. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver of our rights to enforce these Terms. We reserve the right to transfer our rights under these Terms and provide the Services using another entity, provided that entity upholds these Terms. You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

25\. Contact Us

Snap Paid Features Terms


----------------------------

Effective: April 7, 2025

ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OR IF YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN THE UNITED STATES YOU ARE BOUND BY THE [ARBITRATION](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) PROVISION SET FORTH IN THE [SNAP INC. TERMS OF SERVICE](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US): EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES GOVERNED BY YOUR CARDHOLDER AGREEMENT AND CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH IN THE [SNAP INC. TERMS OF SERVICE](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE YOU MAY HAVE WITH SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY AFFILIATE OF SNAP INC., INCLUDING SNAP LLC, SHOULD BE ADDRESSED WITH SNAP INC. 

We have provided summary sections at the end of most clauses. These summaries have been included for your convenience only and you should read these Snap Paid Features Terms in full to understand your legal rights and obligations.

**1\. Introduction**

a. Please read these Snap Paid Features Terms (“Snap Paid Features Terms”) carefully. These Snap Paid Features Terms form a legally binding contract between you and the Snap entity listed below, and govern your purchase and use of any paid digital content or digital services on the Services such as Snapchat+ and Snapstreak Restore (“Paid Features”). The Snap entity that will provide the Paid Features to you corresponds to where you live as follows:

*   If you live in the United States, the Paid Features are provided by Snap Inc.
    
*   If you live in the Asia-Pacific region, which for the purposes of these Paid Features Terms includes Afghanistan, India, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but does not include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation and Turkey, the Paid Features are provided by Snap Group Limited Singapore Branch.
    
*   If you live in any country outside of the United States or the Asia-Pacific region, the Paid Features are provided by Snap Group Limited.
    

b. Your billing statement may reflect that your purchase of, and payment for, a Paid Feature is processed and received by an affiliate of the Snap entity set out above. However, the Services (including the Paid Features) are still provided and fulfilled by the Snap entity corresponding to where you live. You should address any related questions or issues relating to the Services, the Paid Features or these Snap Paid Features Terms to that Snap entity identified above instead. 

c. These Snap Paid Features Terms incorporate by reference the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) and any other applicable terms, guidelines and policies. To the extent these Snap Paid Features Terms conflict with any of the other terms, these Snap Paid Features Terms will govern. Paid Features are part of Snap's “Services” as defined in the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US). 

d. You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, if different) to purchase a Paid Feature. A valid debit/credit card is required to make a purchase. Paid Features have no monetary value and do not constitute property of any type.

e. Additional terms specific to the country in which you live may apply, including the terms in Section 14. Nothing in these Snap Paid Features Terms will affect your legal rights and remedies provided to you under mandatory consumer law of the country in which you are located.

_In summary: You need to be 18+ (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction) to buy Paid Features. Additional terms may apply depending on where you live._

**2\. Your purchase and payment**

a. To purchase a Paid Feature, you must be a registered user and logged in to Snapchat. You accept responsibility for all purchases of Paid Features and use of any Paid Features that occur under your Snapchat account, including payment for any unauthorized amounts billed to your payment method by a third party.

b. We may make Paid Features available for purchase directly from us or via an app-store provider or another third-party purchasing platform (“Purchase Provider”). The price of the Paid Feature will be displayed to you at the point of sale and you will always see the final purchase price before you click to submit your order. If you use a Purchase Provider to purchase Paid Features, you will be redirected to the Purchase Provider’s payment service to enter your payment details and complete your purchase. If you have any issues with completing your order or making your payment through a Purchase Provider, please contact your Purchase Provider directly.

c. When you submit your order to purchase a Paid Feature, we or the relevant Purchase Provider will provide an electronic notification confirming the transaction, at which point, these Paid Feature Terms will come into force between you and Snap. Paid Features will not be made available to you until payment has been received in full, and failure to pay for the full purchase price will result in cancellation, termination or suspension of your access to a Paid Feature. Snap reserves the right to refuse or cancel orders at any time and for any reason. You agree that, if we cancel your purchase, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that we or the relevant Purchase Provider: (i) will issue a credit to the payment method used for that Paid Feature purchase; or (ii) won't charge you for the purchase. 

d. By submitting an order, you authorize Snap or the relevant Purchase Provider to: (i) use information you submit to charge your card or other payment method for the price of the Paid Feature you purchased, in addition to any taxes, fees and charges as described in these Snap Paid Features Terms; and (ii) where you have purchased or activated a Paid Subscription, store and continue billing your chosen payment method without the need for you to re-enter your payment details each time, to avoid interruption of the Paid Subscription. If you use a Purchase Provider to complete your purchase, Snap may receive information about the transaction such as when it was made, when a Paid Subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, which Purchase Provider you used to purchase the Paid Feature, and other relevant information. 

e. If your purchase of a Paid Feature is subject to taxes, you agree to pay the cost of the Paid Feature, plus applicable taxes (including national, state or local sales, use, value added or similar taxes or fees payable in connection with your Paid Feature purchase), fees and charges at the rates in effect when the fees and charges were incurred, free of any withholding or deduction for taxes. Depending on how you purchase the Paid Feature, your Purchase Provider may remit those taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. 

f. Your payment card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card and you must refer to your agreement with that party, and not these Snap Paid Features Terms, to determine the rights and liabilities as between you and them. If you purchase a Paid Feature through a Purchase Provider then their terms and policies also govern your purchase of that Paid Feature. Where the Purchase Provider’s terms are inconsistent with any of the terms set out in these Snap Paid Features Terms, the Purchase Provider’s terms will control solely with respect to any payment and refund-related terms.

_In summary: To purchase a Paid Feature, you need a Snapchat account. You are solely responsible for your account and any activity through it. If you pay for your subscription using a third-party platform (such as an app store), their terms will apply to your payments in addition to these Paid Features Terms, and you may need to contact them in the event of any payment issues._

**3\. Snapchat+ and other Paid Subscriptions**

a. This section applies to your purchase and use of any Paid Feature which is delivered to you as a subscription service (“Paid Subscription”). Paid Subscriptions may provide access to certain features, functionality or other benefits to further enhance your experience on our Services (for example, Snapchat+). 

b. Unless stated otherwise, Paid Subscriptions may be available on a monthly or an annual basis as set out on the order page. Monthly subscriptions start on the date of purchase and continue on a rolling monthly basis until cancelled in accordance with these Snap Paid Features Terms. Annual subscriptions start on the date of purchase and continue for an initial fixed period of one year, renewing for additional periods of one year unless cancelled in accordance with these Snap Paid Features Terms. Payments for each monthly or annual subscription period are payable at the start of the subscription period.

c. Unless cancelled or terminated in accordance with these Snap Paid Features Terms, you agree that your Paid Subscriptions will automatically renew for subsequent periods of the same length as the initial period of the subscription plan you selected at the point of purchase. You expressly authorize us or your Payment Provider to charge your selected initial payment method (e.g., credit card) automatically at the start of each renewal billing period at the then-current rates until your Paid Subscription is cancelled or terminated in accordance with these Snap Paid Features Terms. The price at renewal will be the then-current price of the subscription, which will be notified to you prior to renewal. If your original payment method is declined when a renewal payment is requested, your Paid Subscription will be cancelled at the end of the then-current billing period. 

d. **To avoid your Paid Subscription automatically renewing and incurring future subscription charges, you must cancel your Paid Subscription at any time before the date on which your subscription renews through your subscription settings in Snapchat or through the cancellation process offered by the Purchase Provider you used to purchase the Paid Subscription.** 

e. If you cancel your Paid Subscription, you will still have access to all of its features through the end of your then-current billing period. Once your current billing period has expired, we will remove your access to and use of any features made available to you as part of your Paid Subscription (including any content or information made available to you in connection with any such features). If you are located in the European Union, Norway or the United Kingdom and you cancel a Paid Subscription during the 14 day cooling-off period where permitted under Section 14, your Paid Subscription will end immediately and you will no longer have access to any of its features and benefits. 

f. If we change the purchase price for a Paid Subscription, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice. Any price change to a Paid Subscription will take effect from the start of the next subscription billing period after the date on which we notified you. If you do not agree with any such price change, you should cancel your Paid Subscription prior to the price change. 

g. The current list of Snapchat+ features and benefits are set out on our [Snapchat+ support page,](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7121577610900?lang=en-US) although these are subject to change in accordance with Section 10 of these Terms. 

h. If you receive access to a Paid Subscription as a member of a Friends & Family plan purchased by another account holder, your access to the Paid Subscription will be cancelled if the primary account holder removes you as a recipient, cancels the Friends & Family plan subscription, or their account is otherwise terminated.

_In summary: Paid Subscriptions provide access to features, functionality and benefits which may change over time. Payments auto-renew, unless you decide to cancel. By purchasing a Paid Subscription, you are authorizing automatically recurring payments using the payment method you originally used for initial purchase of your subscription._

**4\. Snapstreak Restore and other digital services that are performed immediately**

a. Snapstreak Restore is a digital service that can be purchased in order to restore a Snapstreak that has expired. Delivery and performance of each Snapstreak Restore is completed immediately following purchase and payment processing and therefore cannot be cancelled. 

b. Any other digital services made available by Snap from time to time that are fully performed immediately following purchase and payment processing also cannot be cancelled.  

**5\. Digital content**

We may make digital content available for purchase through the Services. We will start providing the digital content immediately following completion of your purchase and therefore these purchases cannot be cancelled.  

**6\. Promotions**

a. We or our partners may occasionally offer access to Paid Features to you on a promotional basis (for example, without charge or at a discounted rate for a limited period of time) subject to you meeting certain eligibility requirements as determined by Snap or our partners (“Promotional Offer”). We may also make Promotional Offers available to you on the occurrence of certain events or by asking you to take certain actions. You agree that:

*   any other limitations or conditions associated with a Promotional Offer will be determined by Snap or our partners in our sole discretion and made available to you either when activating or redeeming the Promotional Offer or in other communications from Snap or our partners describing the Promotional Offer;
    
*   Promotional Offers will be used for the intended purpose and must be used in a lawful manner; 
    
*   Snap reserves the right to condition or revoke availability of any Promotional Offer at any time; and 
    
*   no matter how you receive the Promotional Offer, your use is subject to these Snap Paid Features Terms.
    

b. Where you have activated a Promotional Offer (such as a reduced price or a free trial) for a Paid Subscription then, following the expiry of the period of any Promotional Offer that you redeem, you will automatically be moved to the Paid Subscription you elected at the point of redeeming the Promotional Offer and your designated payment method will be charged for the full Paid Subscription, unless you cancel in accordance with these Snap Paid Features Terms. **YOU MUST THEREFORE REMEMBER TO CANCEL YOUR PROMOTIONAL OFFER FOR A PAID SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE SNAP PAID FEATURES TERMS BEFORE THE EXPIRY OF THE PROMOTIONAL OFFER; OTHERWISE, YOU AUTHORIZE US OR YOUR PURCHASE PROVIDER TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER DESIGNATED BILLING METHOD THE FULL FEES FOR THE FOLLOWING BILLING PERIOD(S) UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE SNAP PAID FEATURES TERMS.** 

_In summary: Snap may let you access Paid Features for free or with a discount, but remember that if your Promotional Offer is for a Paid Subscription, you will automatically be charged for the subscription when the offer ends._

**7\. Our cancellation and refund policy**

a. All sales are final and we do not offer any refunds or credits except as required by applicable law or as otherwise set out in these Snap Paid Features Terms. If you are a consumer located in the European Union, Norway or the United Kingdom, you may have a legal right to cancel the purchase of a Paid Feature and to receive a partial or full refund during an initial 14-day cooling off period. Please see Section 14 for more details about how and when this right applies and any limitations or exclusions that may apply.

b. Snap reserves the right to immediately suspend, discontinue or terminate your access to Paid Features, partially or fully, at any time and for any reason, at our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you, including, without limitation, where: 

*   you violate these Snap Paid Features Terms, we terminate or suspend your Snapchat account or we believe that you are engaged in illegal or fraudulent use of the Services (in addition to any remedy that we may have at law or in equity);
    
*   Snap is required to do so by any competent court of law, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency or continued provision of a Paid Feature to you creates possible risk or legal exposure for Snap;
    
*   doing so is required for the protection, integrity and/or security of our Services: or
    
*   our provision of Paid Features (in whole or in part) to you is no longer viable as determined by Snap.
    

c. Except as required by applicable law, in the event of our suspension, discontinuance or cancellation of your access to a Paid Feature, no refunds will be provided for any unused Paid Features associated with your account or any partial remaining periods of a Paid Subscription. 

d. You can cancel a Paid Subscription at any time in accordance with Section 3. 

e. Snap does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop, discount or other promotional offering being made available by us which would reduce the cost of any Paid Feature that you have already purchased. 

_In summary: All sales are final and we do not offer refunds or credits except as required by applicable law or as otherwise set out in these Snap Paid Features Terms (including Section 14). We also have rights to suspend or terminate your access where you have done something wrong or if circumstances change significantly._

**8\. Communications from us**

a. We may send you electronic notifications about any Paid Features you have purchased and these Snap Paid Features Terms, including about new features of, and other changes to, our Paid Features at the email or phone number used to sign up for your account, through in-app notifications, Team Snapchat notifications or by other electronic means. By purchasing a Paid Feature, or by using a Paid Feature, you consent to receive from Snap and our affiliates the electronic communications described in these Snap Paid Features Terms.

b. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

_In summary: Look out for messages about your Paid Features and these Snap Paid Features Terms._

**9\. Purchase and use restrictions**

In addition to the restrictions set out in the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), you agree that: (a) Paid Features are non-transferable to any other account or user of the Services, meaning that your purchase will apply solely to the account you were using when you purchased the Paid Feature; (b) you may not allow others to use your account to access any Paid Features; (c) you have not, and will not, purchase and use Paid Features for any other purpose other than as permitted under these Snap Paid Features Terms and the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US); (d) you are not in restricted countries where purchase and use of the Paid Features are not permitted; (e) you will not use any payment card or other form of payment to purchase a Paid Feature unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so; (f) neither you, nor, if you are business, any affiliated company, are included on any of the restricted party lists maintained by the US Government - including the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List administered by the US Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC") and the Denied Parties List, Unverified List and Entity List maintained by the US Department of Commerce's Bureau on Industry and Security - or by any government authority in the countries where you operate; (g) if you are a business, you are not owned or controlled by such a restricted party; and (h) you are not resident in, located in or organized under the laws of any country with which trade is prohibited by OFAC or other applicable sanctions. 

_In summary: There are certain rules we need you to follow as a condition of your purchase and use of a Paid Feature._

**10\. Changes to Paid Features and pricing**

a. Snap may, at any time, modify, revise or change the specifications, content, pricing, descriptions, benefits or features of any Paid Features and suspend, or discontinue the availability of any Paid Feature, including any related features, content or benefits without notice, refund or liability to you at any time and for any reason. Any descriptions, specifications or pricing of Paid Features we make available to you may also be subject to change to reflect any updates we have made to a Paid Feature so please review these resources frequently. If you are unhappy with any revision we make to any descriptions, specifications or pricing, you must stop using the Paid Feature. 

b. If we change the price for a Paid Subscription, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice. Any price change to a Paid Subscription will take effect from the start of the next subscription period after the date on which we notified you. If you do not agree with any such price change, you have the right to cancel your Paid Subscription prior to the price change as set out in Section 3. Price changes applied to any other Paid Feature will not affect any order you have already placed for that Paid Feature.

c. We may need to update these Snap Paid Features Terms to reflect any changes to our Paid Features or how we provide them, as well as to comply with legal requirements, or for other legal or security reasons. If those changes to these Snap Paid Features Terms are material we will provide you with reasonable advance notice (unless changes are required sooner, for example, as a result of a change in legal requirements or where we are launching new Services or features). If you continue to use the Paid Features once the changes come into effect, we will take that as your acceptance. If at any time you don't agree to any changes to these Snap Paid Features Terms, you must stop using any Paid Features you have purchased. 

_In summary: The Paid Features and the price we charge for them may change at any time and for any reason, although this won’t affect the price of your current subscription period or your order for any other Paid Feature placed before the price change came into effect. We might also update these terms over time, and if you disagree with any of those updates, you must stop using the Paid Features immediately. If there are material changes, we will tell you in advance._

**11\. Availability and errors**

a. While we do our best to describe our products and services as accurately as possible, we do not guarantee that any descriptions, specifications or pricing for our Paid Features are complete, accurate, current or error-free. If there is an error with the pricing or a description or specification for a Paid Feature, your sole remedy is to stop using the relevant Paid Feature or cancel the relevant Paid Subscription. We have the right to refuse, or cancel, your order at our sole discretion if there is a pricing or specification error. 

b. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SNAP DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY PARTICULAR PAID FEATURE, OR ANY FEATURE, CONTENT, BENEFIT OR FUNCTIONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH A PAID FEATURE, WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES OR ANY GIVEN TIME, THAT IT WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT SNAP WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER ACCESS TO A PAID FEATURE OR ANY FEATURE, CONTENT, BENEFIT OR FUNCTIONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH A PAID FEATURE, FOR ANY MINIMUM LENGTH OF TIME.

_In summary: We don’t promise that the Paid Features will be available all the time, and we try our best to describe the Paid Features accurately. If you’re unhappy with how they’ve been described, you can stop using the Paid Feature._

**12\. Final terms**

a. These Snap Paid Features Terms were written in English and to the extent any translated version of these Snap Paid Features Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version will control.

b. Sections 2-7 and 12-14 of these Snap Paid Features Terms will survive any expiration or termination of these Snap Paid Features Terms.

_In summary: Our contract with you on these terms is in English. Some parts will continue to apply after the end of our contract term._

**14\. Country-specific terms**

If you live in any of the countries listed below when you purchase a Paid Feature, the additional terms listed for that country apply to you. 

United Kingdom, European Union and Norway:

_Cancellation Rights_

**Please note that the way you cancel and your cancellation rights may be different to those set out in this section if you have purchased your Paid Feature through a third-party Purchase Provider (e.g. an app store). In which case, your purchase will be subject to their terms and conditions of purchase, so please read the cancellation instructions provided to you by your Purchase Provider carefully to ensure you understand how and when you may cancel.**

If you are a consumer resident in the United Kingdom, the European Union or Norway, for most Paid Features you have a legal right to change your mind and cancel the contract for your purchase within 14 days from the date of your purchase (the “Cancellation Period”). For example, if you make a purchase on the 1st day of the month, the Cancellation Period ends at the end of the 15th day of the month. Please note that this legal right to cancel does not apply to all Paid Features. More details on the limitations and exclusions that apply can be found later on in this section.

To exercise your right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision by a clear statement, such as by email, post or through our online support page (see Section 14 for our contact details). You may use the cancellation form available below, but the easiest way to cancel is to follow the cancellation instructions provided in Snapchat.

You do not have the right to change your mind and cancel the contract if: (i) you consented for us to start providing digital content during the Cancellation Period, and we do start providing the digital content during this period; or (ii) you requested for us to start providing digital services during the Cancellation Period and the digital services are fully completed during this period. 

Your legal right to cancel applies to Paid Features as follows:

*   Paid Subscriptions: Snapchat+ and other Paid Subscriptions are digital services. You can cancel a Paid Subscription during the Cancellation Period. If you do so, you will receive a partial refund of the price you have paid for the subscription, which will be prorated based on how many days of use you have enjoyed during the relevant subscription period. For example, if you cancel seven days into a monthly subscription, we would refund you the monthly subscription fee you have paid less a sum equivalent to seven days’ usage. If you live in the UK: (i) if you have an initial free trial or discounted period, a new Cancellation Period will apply when the subscription converts into a full-price Paid Subscription; and (ii) if you have an annual Paid Subscription, a new Cancellation Period will apply to any automatic annual renewals. In each case, the new Cancellation Period would begin on the day the full price subscription or renewal starts and would end 14 days later (e.g. if the start date is January 1, the end date is January 15).
    
*   Snapstreak Restores and similar digital services: A Snapstreak Restore is a service. It cannot be cancelled because the service (the reinstatement of your Snapstreak) is completed immediately following purchase. The same applies to other digital services that are fully completed immediately after purchase.
    
*   Digital content: Digital content purchases cannot be cancelled. When you purchase digital content you are consenting for us to start providing the digital content immediately.
    

If you are entitled to a refund, we will pay the refund to you within 14 days of receiving notice of your cancellation using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction.

My Selfie Terms


-------------------

Effective: April 29, 2024

ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OR IF YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN THE UNITED STATES YOU ARE BOUND BY THE [ARBITRATION](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) PROVISION SET FORTH IN THE [SNAP INC. TERMS OF SERVICE](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#inc-terms): EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH IN THE [SNAP INC. TERMS OF SERVICE](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#inc-terms), AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

**1\. Introduction**

Please read these My Selfie terms ("My Selfie Terms") carefully. These My Selfie Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap and govern your use of My Selfie and related features on Snapchat, such as AI Snaps, Dreams, Cameos features, and other generative AI features using your image or likeness (collectively, “My Selfie Features”). These My Selfie Terms incorporate by reference the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), [Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US), and any other applicable terms, guidelines, and policies. To the extent these My Selfie Terms conflict with any of the other terms, these My Selfie Terms will govern. My Selfie is part of Snap's "Services" as defined in the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US).

_In summary: These My Selfie Terms, along with other terms and policies referenced in these My Selfie Terms, form a legally binding contract and govern any use of My Selfie and My Selfie Features._

**2\. The Basics**

a. My Selfie is the one-stop shop for photos of yourself that you submit on Snapchat to power generative AI features, including the My Selfie Features. My Selfie is processed and used together with other information we know about you to provide generative AI features, including My Selfie Features that generate stylized portraits that feature you (or your likeness). My Selfie will also be used to develop and improve machine learning models for use throughout the Services and for research purposes. You, Snap, and your Snapchat friends may also independently create and share images generated from My Selfie, in which case you (or your likeness) may appear in images generated by your Snapchat friends or Snap without any notice to you. You also acknowledge and agree that by using My Selfie, you (or your likeness) may also appear in personalized sponsored content and ads that will be visible only to you and that includes branding or other advertising content of Snap or its business partners without compensation to you. 

b. By using My Selfie, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable and perpetual right and license to use, create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay graphics on, overlay auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of generated images of you and your likeness derived from your My Selfie, in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed, for commercial and non-commercial purposes.

c. You cannot create My Selfie for anyone else's Snapchat account, but you can share your AI Snaps, Dreams, Cameos, and other My Selfie Features using your My Selfie on Snapchat and off Snapchat. If you decide to share off Snapchat, you cannot remove Snap watermarks, metadata, or any other features or logos, and doing so is a violation of these My Selfie Terms.

d. You are not permitted to submit photos of anyone other than yourself to My Selfie, or to generate any deepfakes, and doing so is a violation of these My Selfie Terms.

e. If you violate these My Selfie Terms, Snap may, in its sole discretion and in addition to any remedy that we may have at law or in equity, immediately terminate permission for you to use My Selfie and revoke any My Selfie Features in your Snapchat account, without any liability to you.

_In summary: My Selfie can only be used on Snapchat. If you submit images to My Selfie, you allow Snap and others to use the image and your likeness in order to make and distribute generated images with you, such as for AI Snaps, Dreams, Cameos, and other My Selfie Features, which can be used by your friends, in personalized ads delivered to you on Snapchat, and in other ways. Images generated by My Selfie Features can be shared on and off Snapchat. If you violate these My Selfie Terms, we may revoke your right to use My Selfie and My Selfie Features_.

**3\. Purchase and Payment**

Without limiting these My Selfie Terms, if any My Selfie Features are made available for Snapchat+ subscribers, or offered as a paid feature on Snapchat, the [Snap Paid Features Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/paid-features?lang=en-US) will govern your purchase, including any refund and cancellation rights you may have (if any). Any purchased digital content or digital services will be considered a “Paid Feature” under the Snap Paid Features Terms.

_In summary: If you purchase or use any paid My Selfie Features, the_ [_Snap Paid Features Terms_](https://www.snap.com/terms/paid-features?lang=en-US) _will govern your purchase and use in addition to these My Selfie Terms._

**4\. Disclaimer; Service Description and Availability; Errors**

a. My Selfie Features that generate images that include your image or likeness are generated by AI based on the images and information that you provide (including any text, images, or other inputs). My Selfie Features, and any other generative AI-powered features on Snapchat, can create outputs that cannot be predicted in advance. 

b. My Selfie Features and any other generative AI-powered features on Snapchat might generate content that you consider offensive or objectionable, and by agreeing to these My Selfie Terms and using My Selfie, My Selfie Features, or any other generative AI-powered features, you acknowledge and assume that risk. You also acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for your use of, and any actions you take in relation to, any content generated by AI through the My Selfie Features. In addition to the disclaimers in the [Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), Snap makes no representations or warranties with respect to the My Selfie Features or other generative AI-powered features or content, and Snap is not responsible for any use of, or actions in relation to, the My Selfie Features or other generative AI-powered features or content.

c. Snap does not guarantee that My Selfie, My Selfie Features, or any other generative AI-powered features will be available at all times or at any given time, or that we will continue to offer them for any particular length of time. Snap reserves the right to immediately modify, cancel, suspend, discontinue, or terminate My Selfie, My Selfie Features, or any generative AI-powered features at any time and for any reason, at our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. Moreover, while we do our best to describe the features as accurately as possible, we do not warrant that the specifications (or any output the features generate) are complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free.

_In summary: Snap makes no representations or warranties with respect to the My Selfie Features or other generative AI-powered features or content, and you are responsible for your use of the My Selfie Features. Snap is not responsible for any outputs created by the My Selfie Features or any generative AI-powered features. Snap can modify, discontinue, or terminate My Selfie, My Selfie Features, or any generative AI-powered features at any time, and we provide no assurances regarding feature specifications._

**5\. Changes to These My Selfie Terms**

From time to time, we may revise these My Selfie Terms in accordance with [Section 14 of the Snap Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US). You can determine when these My Selfie Terms were last revised by referring to the "Effective" date at the top. If at any time you don't agree to any portion of these My Selfie Terms, you can delete your images and opt out of My Selfie in your settings in Snapchat.

_In summary: We might update these My Selfie Terms over time. If there are changes which you don’t agree with, you can opt out of My Selfie in your settings in Snapchat._

**6\. Communications from us**

a. We may send you electronic notifications about My Selfie and these My Selfie Terms, including about new features of, and other changes to, My Selfie, at the email or phone number used to sign up for your account, through in-app notifications, Team Snapchat notifications, or by other electronic means. By using My Selfie, you consent to receive from Snap and our affiliates the electronic communications described in these My Selfie Terms.

b. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

_In summary: Look out for messages about your My Selfie and these My Selfie Terms._

**7\. Final Terms**

a. These My Selfie Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

b. These My Selfie Terms were written in English and to the extent the translated version of these My Selfie Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version will control.

c. Sections 2-6 of these My Selfie Terms will survive any expiration or termination of these My Selfie Terms.

_In summary: These My SelfieTerms do not create any third-party rights and some provisions of these My Selfie Terms will survive termination._

Public Content Display Terms


--------------------------------

In these Public Content Display Terms, “Snap”, “we” and “us” means either Snap Inc. (if you live in the United States or if you are using the Services on behalf of a business located in the United States) or Snap Group Limited (if you live or are using the Services on behalf of a business located elsewhere). By embedding Snap’s audiovisual player or other product(s) that we make available to you (the “**Embed**”), you agree to these Public Content Display Terms, which incorporate by reference our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), [Privacy Policy](https://www.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy?lang=en-US), [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), and [Advertising Policies](https://www.snap.com/ad-policies?lang=en-US) (collectively, and together with these Public Content Display Terms, the “**Terms**”). The Embed is one of our Services, as that term is defined in our Terms of Service and used throughout the Terms. Please read the Terms carefully. We may update or change the Terms at any time without notice, so please also read them regularly. By continuing to use the Service, you accept any updates to the Terms. To the extent these Public Content Display Terms conflict with other terms governing the Service, these Public Content Display Terms will apply.

**TERMS OF SERVICE REMINDER AND ARBITRATION NOTICE**: AS A REMINDER TO OUR USERS THAT LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND BUSINESSES LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR TERMS OF SERVICE, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS: INDEMNITY, DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND ARBITRATION, CLASS-ACTION, AND JURY WAIVER, APPLY TO AND ARE INCORPORATED INTO THESE PUBLIC CONTENT DISPLAY TERMS. THIS MEANS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN OUR TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND SNAP AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

1\. License

Snap grants you a personal, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to (a) use the Embed on a website or mobile application in order to distribute Public Content (which is defined in our Terms of Service) and (b) display the Snapchat name and logo, solely to attribute the Snapchat application as the source of the Embed.

All rights not expressly granted to you in this section are reserved by Snap. Nothing in these Terms grants you an implied license of any kind.

2\. General Terms

By using the Embed, you will be able to display Public Content outside of the Snapchat application. While we provide this feature so that members of our community (including you) can share Public Content to a broader audience, you must comply with the following while using it:

*   Always use the Embed and display Public Content in compliance with any branding or attribution requirements that we provide, including the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US).
    
*   As a reminder, your use of the Embed is still a use of Snapchat and must comply with our [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US).
    
*   The license we’ve granted you in these Public Content Display Terms does not include a license to the third party intellectual property or other proprietary rights that may be included in Public Content. You agree to obtain all necessary rights, permissions, and licenses before you use and distribute the Public Content on a website, or mobile application using the Embed.
    
*   Always comply with any requirements or restrictions imposed on the use of Public Content by us or any other owner of the Public Content.
    
*   Promptly remove any Public Content and the related Embed that we — or the owner of the Public Content, if that isn’t us — ask you to remove.
    
*   Don’t use Public Content in any advertisement or advertising product without the explicit permission from the owner of the Public Content.
    
*   Don’t use the Embed or Public Content to imply sponsorship by, endorsement from, or a false association with Snap, any of its users, or third party content providers.
    
*   Don’t collect data related to the Embed or Public Content or the Snapchat application in a manner that violates the Terms.
    
*   Always use the Embed and display Public Content in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
    
*   Don’t use the Embed or Public Content on a website, or mobile application with terms that conflict with the Terms.
    
*   Don’t use the Embed or Public Content in a way that indicates it is from a social platform or medium other than the Snapchat application.
    
*   Don’t use the Embed or Public Content to replicate or compete with the Snapchat application.
    

3\. Content Appropriateness

In addition to the disclaimers included in any of our other Terms, by displaying Public Content on a website, or mobile application, you understand that Public Content is created by our users and may not be appropriate for all audiences or ages. As such, you agree that Snap is not liable for any claims based on or arising from Public Content.

Snap Inc. Community Geofilter Terms and Conditions


------------------------------------------------------

Effective: January 10, 2017

PLEASE NOTE:  THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN [ARBITRATION CLAUSE](https://www.snap.com/terms/create-geofilter?lang=en-US#arbitration-clause) A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

Introduction

Please read these Community Geofilter Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) carefully. If you live in the United States, these Terms govern your submission of an image file (the “Asset”) to Snap Inc. for use as a Community Geofilter (a “Geofilter”). These Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap Inc. By submitting the Asset, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree with these Terms, then don’t submit an Asset.

These Terms incorporate by reference our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), [Community Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/guidelines?lang=en-US), [Privacy Policy](https://www.snapchat.com/privacy?lang=en-US), and [Submission Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/geofilter-guidelines?lang=en-US), so please read each of them carefully. Among other things, this means that your submission of an Asset is subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability in the [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), and that the information we collect from you during your submission is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.snapchat.com/privacy?lang=en-US). To the extent these Terms conflict with the [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), [Community Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/guidelines?lang=en-US), [Privacy Policy](https://www.snapchat.com/privacy?lang=en-US), or [Submission Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/geofilter-guidelines?lang=en-US), these Terms will govern.

You affirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you live) and are competent and authorized to agree to and abide by these Terms. If you want to submit an Asset and are under the age of majority, you must have your parents’ express permission.

When you submit an Asset, you’re asking Snap Inc. to let users of the Snapchat application put the Asset on their Snaps in a particular place (a “Geofence”). The Asset must comply with our [Community Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/guidelines?lang=en-US) and follow our [Submission Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/geofilter-guidelines?lang=en-US).

You acknowledge and agree that Snap Inc. has the unrestricted right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether an Asset will be made available as a Geofilter, and if so, when. We may adjust the Geofence in our sole discretion.

1\. Your License to Us

You grant to Snap Inc. and our affiliates an exclusive, perpetual, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to archive, copy, cache, encode, store, reproduce, record, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, synchronize, adapt, edit, modify, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, republish, promote, exhibit, create derivative works based upon, and otherwise use the Asset in connection with the Services (as defined in the [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US)) and the advertising, marketing, and promotion thereof, in all formats, on or through any means or media now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed. This license includes the right for Snap Inc. and its affiliates to make the Asset available to Snapchat users, for sharing among Snapchat users, and for saving to their devices.

You acknowledge and agree that Snapchat users may be able to save, share, and view Snaps that incorporate the Geofilter during and beyond the Geofilter’s run time. You acknowledge that Snapchat users may use the Asset for purposes or in ways other than you anticipated. You agree that such uses constitute user-generated content for which Snap Inc. bears no responsibility. You agree that Snap Inc. is not liable for any claims or losses based on or arising from any user-generated content, including but not limited to user content that makes use of the Asset, whether within the Services or beyond.

You agree that neither Snap Inc. nor its affiliates are under any obligation to pay you or any third party any consideration or compensation for the Asset or any use of the Asset. To the extent permissible by law, you irrevocably waive—or agree not to assert against Snap Inc. and its affiliates to the extent a waiver is not permitted—any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in the Asset throughout the world. You agree that Snap Inc. may in its discretion resize, set the transparency of, and make other alterations to the Asset.

If Snap Inc. does make the Asset available on the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Snap Inc. has the right (but no obligation) to publicly attribute the Asset to you, including by posting your name, city, state, and country, as submitted by you or as tied to your Snapchat account.

2\. Communications from Us

When you submit an Asset, we’ll email a submission confirmation to the email address tied to your Snapchat account. That submission confirmation does not mean we’ve approved your submission. We reserve the right to accept or decline your submission for any reason and at any time, including after the Geofilter has started to run. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any submission.

We may send you other emails about your submission or the Geofilter, including about status, changes, updates, or cancellations to the Geofilter. We may also send you emails about your experience with the Geofilter, or other communications regarding your submission. By submitting an Asset you consent to receive from Snap Inc. and our affiliates the email communications described in these Terms.

You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

3\. Delivery of the Geofilter

If the Geofilter is made available on the Services, we will try to deliver it to Snapchat users who are located within the Geofence. We do not guarantee perfect delivery, and we do not guarantee that any Snapchat users will choose to use the Geofilter. Some Snapchat users within the Geofence may not see the Geofilter, and some outside the Geofence may see the Geofilter. Accuracy of delivery depends in part on the strength of a Snapchat user’s GPS or Wi-Fi signal. Snapchat users with location services or filters disabled will not see Geofilters.

We may, in our sole discretion, choose to share information with you about use of the Geofilter. Unless we grant you express permission in writing, you may not use that information for commercial purposes.

4\. Promotions

If you use the Geofilter or any part of the Services as part of a sweepstakes, contest, offer, or other promotion (each, a “Promotion”), you are solely responsible for complying with all laws that apply to your Promotion wherever it is offered, as well as with our [Promotions Rules](https://support.snapchat.com/a/promotions-rules?lang=en-US). Unless we expressly agree otherwise in writing, Snap Inc. will not be a sponsor or an administrator of your Promotion.

5\. Your Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that (a) the Asset is original to you and does not include any third party’s name, logo, trademark, service mark, image, or likeness, and you have all rights to license the asset to Snap Inc. and our affiliates; (b) the Asset does not violate these Terms, our [Community Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/guidelines?lang=en-US), or our [Submission Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/a/geofilter-guidelines?lang=en-US); (c) the Asset does not, and its use in connection with the Services will not, violate, misappropriate, or infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, privacy, or publicity rights, or any other rights of any person or entity; (d) you have not assigned, licensed, or otherwise encumbered the Asset to any other person or entity; (e) the Asset complies with laws and is suitable for audiences ages 13 and up; (f) the Asset does not, and will not, defame, bully, cause injury or harm to, or inflict emotional distress on, any third party; and (g) any and all information you have provided to Snap Inc. in connection with the Asset and your submission is accurate and correct. In the event Snap Inc. approves and uses the Asset, such approval will not diminish or waive your representations and warranties contained in these Terms.

You further represent and warrant (a) that you are not included on any of the restricted party lists maintained by the U.S. Government, including the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) and the Denied Parties List, Unverified List, and Entity List maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security; and (b) that you are not resident or located in any country with which trade is prohibited by OFAC or other applicable sanctions.

6\. Your Indemnification to Us

You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap Inc., our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) our use of the Asset in connection with the Services; (b) your use of the Services and your activities in connection with the Services; (c) your violation or alleged violation of any laws in connection with your use of the Services or your activities in connection with the Services; (d) any claim that the Asset infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, design right, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (e) any fraud or misrepresentation by you; or (f) any violation or alleged violation of these Terms by you, including any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties, and obligations.

7\. Your Work as an Independent Contractor

You acknowledge that all work you perform in relation to the Asset will be done as an independent contractor. Nothing in these Terms will be construed to imply a joint venture, principal-agent, or employment relationship between you and Snap Inc.

8\. Governing Law and Disputes Between You and Snap Inc.

These Terms are governed by the Choice of Law provision of our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US).

ARBITRATION NOTIFICATION: YOU AND SNAP INC. AGREE THAT CLAIMS AND DISPUTES (WHETHER CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING STATUTORY CLAIMS AND DISPUTES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

For additional details about this arbitration agreement, please refer to the [Arbitration Clause](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) in our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), which REQUIRES YOU AND SNAP INC. TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, and which will apply to any submission.

9\. Changes to These Terms

From time to time, we may revise these Terms. You can determine when these Terms were last revised by referring to the “Effective” date at the top. Any changes to these Terms will become effective when we post the updated Terms on our website, and will apply to any Assets you submit after that. By submitting an Asset after these Terms have been updated you will be deemed to have agreed to the updated Terms. If at any time you don’t agree to any portion of these Terms, don’t submit an Asset.

10\. Final Terms

These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. If any provision of these Terms is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms (which will remain in full force and effect). To the extent permitted by law, you waive any applicable statutory or common-law right that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter. Snap Inc. may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice. These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of Snap Inc.

(“Snap”), and govern your submission of a Lens (“Lens”), Lens icon, and related components (collectively, the materials you submit are the “Assets”) via Lens Studio. The products and services described in these Terms are “Services” as defined in the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us). If you live in the United States or if you are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located in the United States, these Terms govern your submission. If you live outside the United States or are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located outside the United States, the [Snap Group Limited Lens Studio Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/lens-studio-terms?lang=en-US#terms-row) apply.

Please print a copy of these Terms and keep them for your reference. To submit Assets, you will need to agree to the [Snap Inc. Lens Studio License Agreement](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/terms?lang=en-US), which will be presented to you when you download or otherwise access the Lens Studio software (“Lens Software”). If you don’t agree with these Terms, then don’t download or access the Lens Software and don’t submit Assets. To submit Assets, you may need to log in with your Snapchat account.

These Terms incorporate by reference the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us), [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Snapcode Usage Guidelines](https://support.snapchat.com/article/snapcode-guidelines?lang=en-US), and [Lens Studio Submission Guidelines](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/publishing/submitting/submission-guidelines?lang=en-US), so please read each of them carefully. Among other things, this means that your submission of Assets is subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability in the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us). In addition, the [Generative Lens Tools Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/generative-lens-tools?lang=en-US) and [Generative Lens Tools Submission Guidelines](https://ml.snapchat.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) are further incorporated by reference and govern your use of any generative AI-powered tools we make available in or in connection with Lens Studio, including GenAI Suite and any other tools that use visual or text prompts provided by you to generate Assets and other outputs based on those prompts.

Please also review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.snapchat.com/privacy?lang=en-US) to learn how we handle information when you use the Services. You agree that we can collect, use, and share your information as described in that policy and any updates to that policy. To the extent these Terms conflict with the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us), [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Snapcode Usage Guidelines](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012293046420?lang=en-US), [Generative Lens Tools Submission Guidelines](https://ml.snapchat.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or [Lens Studio Submission Guidelines](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/publishing/submitting/submission-guidelines?lang=en-US), these Terms will govern.

If you want to submit Assets and are under the age of majority, you must have your parents’ express permission.

You agree that the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout these Terms, apply to both you and the business, as applicable.

1\. Your License to Us

You grant to Snap and our affiliates a non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to archive, copy, cache, encode, store, reproduce, record, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, synchronize, adapt, edit, modify, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, republish, promote, exhibit, create derivative works based upon, and otherwise use the Assets on or in connection with the Services and the advertising, marketing, and promotion thereof, in all formats, on or through any means or media now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed. This license includes the right for Snap and our affiliates to make the Assets available to users of Snapchat and third party services, for sharing by those users, and for saving to their devices. The license to make the Assets available within the Services extends for 90 days following the date when the Lens run time on the Services ends, in order to allow us to deliver Snaps that include the Lens. The license extends perpetually for the limited purposes of advertising, marketing, and promoting the Services, and for Memories on Snapchat.

If you incorporate your or any third party’s name, trademark, likeness, image, visual work, musical composition, lyrics, sound effect, sound recording, choreographic work, or other materials (collectively, “Additional Elements”) into the Assets, you agree that this license applies to all Additional Elements.

You acknowledge that third-parties may use the Assets for purposes or in ways other than you anticipated. You agree that such uses constitute user-generated content for which neither Snap nor our affiliates bear any responsibility. You agree that neither Snap nor our affiliates are liable for any claims or losses based on or arising from any user-generated content, including content that makes use of the Assets, whether within the Services or beyond.

You acknowledge and agree that Snap and our affiliates own all rights in the Lens product, including the Lens Studio and Lens Software, and any other creative tools we may make available to you to create the Assets (such as templates or Bitmoji).

You agree that neither Snap nor our affiliates are under any obligation to pay you or any third party any consideration or compensation for the Assets or any use of the Assets. To the extent permissible by law, you irrevocably waive—or agree not to assert against Snap or our affiliates to the extent a waiver is not permitted—any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in the Assets throughout the world.

You acknowledge and agree that Snap has the right (but no obligation) to publicly attribute the Assets to you, including by posting your name, business name (if applicable), Lens name, Snapchat account username or display name, city, state, and country, as submitted by you or as tied to your Snapchat account.

2\. Asset Content Restrictions

The Assets must comply with our [Lens Studio Submission Guidelines](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/publishing/submitting/submission-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Generative Lens Tools Submission Guidelines](https://ml.snapchat.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) and must be appropriate for people ages 13+.

3\. Communications from Us

We may send you electronic notifications about your submission, about the Lens product, or about our other products or services, using the contact information submitted by you, or tied to your Snapchat account, as applicable. By submitting Assets you consent to receive from Snap and our affiliates the electronic communications described in these Terms.

You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

4\. Delivery of the Lens

Assets must comply with the technical requirements made available by Snap. We do not guarantee delivery of the Lens and we do not guarantee that anyone will choose to use the Lens.

After you submit Assets, Snap may provide you a scannable code (“Snapcode”). Your use of that Snapcode must comply with the [Snapchat Brand Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/brand-guidelines?lang=en-US) and [Snapcode Usage Guidelines](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012293046420?lang=en-US).

Snapchat users will be given the option to access the Lens by scanning the Snapcode or through other means provided by Snap (each, an “unlock”). Any Snapchat user may unlock the Lens.

Snap reserves the right to deactivate the unlock and redirect the unlock, each at Snap’s sole discretion. Snap reserves the right to reject or cancel a Lens at any time, including after issuing a Snapcode, because you or the Lens violate our terms or guidelines, or for any other reason in its sole discretion.

Snap may provide you with the option to attach a call to action to the Lens that includes a swipe-up to a webview, your store on the Snap Merchant Services, or other content. Any call to action will form part of the Assets.

Snap may, in its sole discretion, choose to share information with you about use of the Lens. Unless we grant you express permission in writing, you may not use that information for commercial purposes.

5\. Promotions

If you use the Lens or any part of the Services as part of a sweepstakes, contest, offer, or other promotion (each, a “Promotion”), you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations wherever your Promotion is offered, as well as with our [Promotions Rules](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7047502545044?lang=en-US). Unless we expressly agree otherwise in writing, neither Snap nor our affiliates will be a sponsor or an administrator of your Promotion.

6\. Your Representations and Warranties

In addition to your representations and warranties under the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us), you represent and warrant that (a) you have all rights and any necessary consents to license the Assets and any Additional Elements incorporated into the Assets, and to grant any waivers in connection with the Assets and any Additional Elements incorporated into the Assets, to Snap and our affiliates; (b) the Assets do not violate these Terms, our [Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US), [Generative Lens Tools Submission Guidelines](https://ml.snapchat.com/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or [Lens Studio Submission Guidelines](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/publishing/submitting/submission-guidelines?lang=en-US); (c) the Assets do not, and its use in connection with the Services will not, violate, misappropriate, or infringe any patent, copyright (including music copyright rights, such as master, synchronization, or public performance rights), trademark, privacy, or publicity rights, or any other rights of any person or entity; (d) you have not assigned, licensed, or otherwise encumbered the Assets to any other person or entity; (e) for any music that you incorporate as an Additional Element, you have paid, and will pay, all amounts, if any, that have become or may become payable to any and all record labels, music publishers, public performance organizations (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, SACEM), musicians, composers, and other rights-holders as a result of such music being exploited pursuant to these Terms; (f) the Assets comply with all laws, rules, and regulations, and are suitable for audiences ages 13 and up; (g) the Assets do not, and will not, defame, bully, cause injury or harm to, or inflict emotional distress on, any third party; and (h) any and all information you have provided to Snap in connection with the Assets and your submission is accurate and correct. In the event Snap makes the Assets available on the Services, this will not diminish or waive your representations and warranties contained in these Terms.

You further represent and warrant that (a) neither you, nor, if you are a business, any affiliated company, are included on any of the restricted party lists maintained by the U.S. Government -- including the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) and the Denied Parties List, Unverified List, and Entity List maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security -- or by any government authority in the countries where you operate; (b) if you are a business, you are not owned or controlled by such a restricted party; and (c) you are not resident in, located in, or organized under the laws of any country with which trade is prohibited by OFAC or other applicable sanctions.

If you are submitting Assets on behalf of a business, you further represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the business with the authority to bind the business to these Terms and agree on behalf of the business to be bound by these Terms.

7\. Your Indemnification to Us

In addition to your indemnification obligations under the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us), you agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) Snap’s use and any third party’s use of the Assets, including the Additional Elements, if any, in connection with the Services; (b) your use of the Services and your activities in connection with the Services; (c) your violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, and regulations in connection with your use of the Services or your activities in connection with the Services; (d) any claim that the Assets infringe, violate, or misappropriate any copyright, trademark, trade secret, design right, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (e) your use of products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Services, even if recommended or approved by Snap; (f) any fraud or misrepresentation by you; or (g) any violation or alleged violation of these Terms by you, including any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties, or obligations.

8\. No Agency Relationship

You acknowledge that nothing in these Terms will be construed to imply a joint venture, principal-agent, or employment relationship between you and Snap or our affiliates.

9\. Governing Law and Disputes Between You and Snap

These Terms are governed by the [Choice of Law](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#choice-of-law) provision and [Exclusive Venue](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#exclusive-venue) provision of the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us).

ARBITRATION NOTIFICATION: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THE [ARBITRATION](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) PROVISION OF THE [SNAP INC. TERMS OF SERVICE](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us), YOU AND SNAP AGREE THAT CLAIMS AND DISPUTES, INCLUDING STATUTORY CLAIMS AND DISPUTES, ARISING BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE ARBITRATION PROVISION OF THE [SNAP INC. TERMS OF SERVICE](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us), AND YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

If you have submitted Assets on behalf of a business, the [Arbitration](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#arbitration) provision of the [Snap Inc. Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US#terms-us) will apply, except that the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules will govern the arbitration instead of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.

10\. Changes to These Terms

From time to time, we may revise these Terms. You can determine when these Terms were last revised by referring to the “Effective” date at the top. Any changes to these Terms will become effective when we post the updated Terms on our website, and will apply to any Assets you submit after that time. By submitting Assets after these Terms have been updated you will be deemed to have agreed to the updated Terms. If at any time you don’t agree to any portion of these Terms, don’t submit Assets.

11\. Final Terms

These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. If any provision of these Terms is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms (which will remain in full force and effect). As used in these Terms, “including” means “including without limitation.” Snap may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice. These Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of Snap. These Terms were written in English, and to the extent a translated version of these Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version will control.

Effective: February 17, 2025

ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU ARE BOUND BY THE [ARBITRATION](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US#governing-law-and-disputes) PROVISION SET FORTH IN THE [BUSINESS SERVICES TERMS](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US). IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH SNAP INC., THEN YOU AND SNAP INC. WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

**Introduction**

These AI Tools Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Snap, govern your use of any generative AI and other AI-powered tools Snap makes available to you through or in connection with the Business Services (“AI Tools”), and are incorporated into the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US). Some terms used in these AI Tools Terms are defined in the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US).

**1\. AI Tools**

a. AI Tools use inputs including text prompts, images, audio files, videos, documents, data or other content provided by you or used at your direction (“Inputs”) to generate outputs based on those Inputs, including content and suggestions (“Outputs”).

b. As between the parties (and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law), each party or their licensors shall retain ownership of any pre-existing rights in any Inputs and Outputs. Snap or its licensors own the AI Tools and any underlying technologies used to generate Outputs.

c. All Inputs and Outputs will be treated for the purposes of the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US) as content you submit to the Services and accordingly any rights and licenses granted to us and obligations on you in respect of content submitted or made available by you in the [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms/snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) shall apply to Inputs and Outputs, in addition to any rights, licenses, and obligations contained in any other applicable Supplemental Terms and Policies.

**2\. Inputs**

In addition to any restrictions set forth in the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US), you will ensure that: (a) Inputs do not contain or make use of, and otherwise could not reasonably be expected to generate Outputs that contain or make use of: (i) any personal data; or (ii) content that would violate the rights of others or has otherwise been unlawfully obtained; and (b) you comply with any submission guidelines or other policies we make available to you that apply to your use of an AI Tool or submission of Inputs. In addition you must not, and must not take any action that would reasonably be expected to, direct the AI Tools to generate any Outputs in violation of the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US), any applicable intellectual property right, contractual restriction or Applicable Laws. 

**3\. Outputs**

a. In addition to any restrictions set forth in the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US), you may only use Outputs in connection with the Business Services and you may not use those Outputs on or with any other service, platform, or technology, whether alone or in combination with other content.

b. You must not and must not take any action that would reasonably be expected to: (i) misrepresent Outputs as having been human-generated or otherwise generated without the use of artificial intelligence; or (ii) alter, obscure or remove any watermark or disclosure applied to Outputs by the AI Tools.

**4\. Disclaimer**

a. You agree and acknowledge that: (i) Outputs are provided as-is and made available to you without representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied; (ii) Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, offensive, objectionable, inappropriate, infringing, unsuitable, unlawful, unfit for particular purpose, or the same or similar to content generated for other users of the Services; and (iii) you use the AI Tools and any Outputs at your own risk, and you should not rely on them for medical, legal, investment, financial or other professional advice. Outputs may also contain content inconsistent with Snap’s view and are not Snap representations. Snap does not endorse any content included in any Outputs.

b. You are solely responsible for evaluating any Output to determine its suitability for use, and for any use of Outputs, including ensuring that any Output used with or in connection with the Services complies with the [Business Services Terms](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US). 

**5\. Entire Agreement**

These AI Tools Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and Snap with respect to your use of the AI Tools and supersede all other agreements between you and Snap regarding the AI Tools.

Your use of the outputs must comply with our_ [_Business Services Terms_](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US) _and other applicable Supplemental Terms and Policies. There are certain restrictions on your use of our AI Tools, including that you must not submit anything or direct the AI Tools to create anything that: (i) you do not have the rights to; (ii) breaches our_ [_Business Services Terms_](https://www.snap.com/terms/business-services?lang=en-US)_; or (iii) violates any laws or otherwise violates any rights of any person._
