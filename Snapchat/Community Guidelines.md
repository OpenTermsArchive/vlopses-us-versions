Community Guidelines


========================

At Snap, we empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. We created these Community Guidelines to encourage self-expression while helping Snapchatters stay safe. We want these guidelines to be clear and easy to understand. As noted in our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US), these guidelines are part of your contract with Snap and you must follow them. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) and check your local laws to make sure you are old enough to join our community. 

  

### 

Note About Severe Harm

While we prohibit all content or behavior that violates our Community Guidelines, we are especially concerned with violations that pose a risk of severe harm to Snapchatters. We disable accounts we identify engaging in such behavior. Guidance about what we consider to be severe harm and how we take action against it is available. [Learn More](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/severe-harm?lang=en-US)

### 

Community Guidelines apply to all users and all content

These guidelines apply to all content and all Snapchatters. This includes [usernames and display names](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/usernames-and-displaynames?lang=en-US), text, images, videos, generative AI, links or attachments, emojis, Lenses and other creative tools, and all behavior on Snapchat. 

Snap offers generative AI features through our services. We implement safeguards designed to help keep generative AI content in line with our Community Guidelines. We also expect Snapchatters to use AI responsibly. We reserve the right to take appropriate enforcement action against accounts that use AI to violate our Community Guidelines or abuse our AI products. This can include termination of an account.  

In addition to our Community Guidelines, advertisers and media partners must comply with further guidelines. For example, their content must be accurate and, where appropriate, fact-checked. Developers are also subject to [additional rules](https://www.snap.com/terms/developer?lang=en-US).  

We've outlined here and in our [Terms of Service](https://snap.com/en-US/terms?lang=en-US) specific rules for content that is prohibited on Snapchat. We work to ensure these rules are applied consistently. When applying them, we take into account the nature of the content, including whether it is newsworthy, factual, and relates to a matter of political, social, or educational value. Additional context about how we moderate content and enforce our policies is available [here](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/moderation?lang=en-US). We also provide links to more detailed information about our Community Guidelines in each of the sections below.  

We want Snapchat to be a safe and positive experience for everyone. We reserve the right to decide, at our sole discretion, what content or behavior violates the spirit of our rules. While we have the right to review, moderate, or remove any content from our platform, we do not proactively review all of it. We cannot guarantee that other users will comply with our Community Guidelines or that our platform will be free of violating content. We strongly encourage Snapchatters to report any content that may be violating so that our teams can review and take appropriate action.

###

Information and Q&A


-----------------------

How can I report something?

You can always submit a report to our safety teams using our [in-app reporting features](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012399221652?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_snap&utm_campaign=cg&lang=en-US) or by completing [this form](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/requests/new?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_snap&utm_campaign=cg&lang=en-US), which allows you to report a concern whether you have a Snapchat account or not. We review these reports to determine violations of these guidelines.

What happens if I violate the Community Guidelines?

If you violate these Community Guidelines, we may remove the offending content, terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and/or notify law enforcement. Our policy is to refer information to law enforcement, potentially including relevant content and other account data, when we believe activity poses an imminent threat to human life. If your account is disabled for violating these guidelines, you are not allowed to use Snapchat again without our permission.

Do you consider off-platform behavior?

Snap reserves the right to remove or restrict account access for users whom we have reason to believe, in our sole discretion, pose a danger to others, on or off of Snapchat. Examples include convicted sex offenders, leaders of terrorist organizations, individuals who incite violence or perpetrate severe harms against others, or behavior that we believe poses a threat to human life. In evaluating such behavior, we may consider guidance from other sources, such as subject matter experts or law enforcement, in determining whether to remove or restrict account access.

Where can I find more information?

Please visit our [Safety Center](https://values.snap.com/safety/safety-center?lang=en-US) for more information about safety and well-being on Snapchat. There, you’ll find detailed instructions on managing your Snapchat experience, including taking actions like updating your privacy settings, choosing who can see your content, and blocking other users.

Severe Harm

Community Guidelines Explainer Series

_Updated: December 2023_

The safety of Snapchatters is our top priority. We take behavior that threatens the safety of our community very seriously, particularly when the threat of harm is severe. We consider severe harm to include both (1) harms that risk significant damage to the physical or emotional well-being of Snapchatters, and (2) the imminent, credible risk of severe harm, including threats to human life, safety, and well-being. We collaborate with experts, safety groups, and law enforcement on these topics in order to better educate ourselves and our community, and to take appropriate action where these threats may arise on our platform. We consider these types of harms to merit a heightened level of scrutiny, as well as swift, strict, and permanent consequences for violators. 

  
When we identify Snapchatters engaging in any of the following activities, we immediately disable their accounts and, in some instances, refer the conduct to law enforcement:

* Activity that involves sexual exploitation or abuse, including sharing child sexual exploitation or abuse imagery, grooming, child or adult sex trafficking, or sexual extortion (sextortion)   
    
* Attempted selling, exchanging, or facilitating sales of dangerous and illicit drugs
    
* Credible, imminent threats to human life, safety, or well-being, which may include violent extremism or terrorism-related activities, human trafficking, specific threats of violence (such as a bomb threat), or other serious criminal activities   
    

In addition to enforcing stricter consequences for these violations, our internal teams are continually working with experts to better understand how we can detect and limit threats, prevent harm, and stay informed of potentially harmful trends. Our work on this topic is never finished and it will continue to evolve with the needs of our community. We invite you to [report a safety concern](https://values.snap.com/safety/safety-reporting?lang=en-US), visit our [Safety Center](https://values.snap.com/safety/safety-center?lang=en-US), or learn more about our [efforts to address harmful content and promote wellness](https://values.snap.com/news?lang=en-US).

Community Guidelines

Threats, Violence, & Harm


=============================

Community Guidelines Explainer Series

Updated: February 2025

### 

Overview

The safety and well-being of our community is a top priority at Snapchat, and we take all instances of threats, violence, and harm seriously. We do not allow content that encourages, threatens, or graphically depicts violent or dangerous behavior, or content that glorifies or encourages self-harm. Imminent threats to human life and safety may be referred to law enforcement.

  
While our policies and moderation practices help to ensure our platform is safe for all users, we also proactively invest in features and resources to help support the well-being of our community. We encourage Snapchatters to report content that indicates self-harm or emotional distress so that our teams can send resources, which may be helpful, and potentially alert emergency health responders.

### 

What you should expect

Our Community Guidelines relating to threats, violence, and harm reflect a commitment to removing content that undermines our community’s safety, while also being attentive to urgent expressions of distress on our platform.

To promote safety, the following is prohibited on Snapchat: 

* Glorification of self-harm, including the promotion of self-injury, self-mutilation, suicide, or eating disorders. 
    
* Encouraging or engaging in violent or threatening behavior, including any content expressing an intention to cause serious physical or emotional harm to a person, a group of people, or damage to their property. Where content indicates a credible and imminent threat to human life or safety, our teams may alert law enforcement agencies who may be positioned to intervene. 
    
* Vigilante activity. This includes coordinated efforts to intimidate or take physical action against individuals or communities outside proper legal process. 
    
* Encouraging or engaging in dangerous behavior. This includes engaging in activities likely to be imitated that could lead to serious harm, such as high-risk challenges, reckless driving, or other behavior that poses a risk to public safety. 
    
* Content that glorifies, or risks inciting, violent or harmful behavior toward people or animals.  
    
* Snaps of gratuitous or graphic violence, including animal abuse.
    

  
Where users report content that indicates a risk of self-harm, our teams review these reports with an eye toward providing helpful resources and potentially identifying opportunities for emergency services to intervene, where possible. Additional information about our safety resources is available on our [Privacy, Safety, & Policy Hub](https://values.snap.com/safety/safety-resources?lang=en-US).

To further support the well-being of our community, our [Here For You](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/articles/7012332426900?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_snap&utm_campaign=cg&lang=en-US) portal helps to surface resources from expert localized partners when users search for certain topics related to mental health, anxiety, depression, stress, suicidal thoughts, grief and bullying.

### 

Takeaway

Our approach to responding to threats, violence, and harm are tailored to the situation. When it comes to threats to oneself, our teams work to identify the best means of support via safety resources. Where others are under threat, we strive for safe outcomes both through the enforcement of our policies and, where necessary, in collaboration with law enforcement.

Doing our part to support the safety and well-being of our community is a top priority across our company.

Community Guidelines

Illegal or Regulated Activities


===================================

Community Guidelines Explainer Series

Updated: May 2025

### 

Overview

Our prohibition against illegal and regulated activities reflects our stalwart commitment to safety across Snapchat. Upholding these rules not only helps ensure our platform is not misused for unlawful purposes, but also helps protect Snapchatters from risks of serious harm. To help advance these aims, we partner extensively with safety stakeholders, NGOs, and law enforcement organizations to provide our community with educational resources and to generally promote public safety.

While laws and regulations differ in jurisdictions throughout the world––and Snapchat is a global community––our policies generally prohibit any activity that undermines public safety or violates human rights, the laws of the United States, or the laws of the country in which the user is located.

In all cases, prohibited illegal activities include promotion of criminal activity; facilitation or participation in cybercrime; and buying, selling, or facilitating sales of illegal or regulated drugs, contraband, or weapons.

### 

What you should expect

Our rules prohibit the following: 

* Using Snapchat for any illegal activity. This includes promoting, facilitating, or participating in criminal activity, such as buying, selling, exchanging, or facilitating sales of illegal or regulated drugs, contraband (such as child sexual abuse or exploitation imagery), endangered animals, or weapons. It also includes promoting or facilitating any form of exploitation, including human trafficking or sex trafficking.
    
* The illegal promotion of regulated goods or industries. Examples of regulated activities that require prior approval from Snap include facilitating online gambling activities; selling alcoholic beverages; tobacco, or vape products; and promoting THC businesses. Businesses are encouraged to consult [this resource](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US) for guidance regarding appropriate commerce and advertising activities on Snapchat.
    

We are committed to ensuring that Snapchatters have as much information as possible regarding the types of online behavior and activities that may violate the law and present serious risk to their safety. Through partnerships with nonprofit organizations and collaboration with diverse safety stakeholders, we aim to raise awareness about high-risk activities and ways that Snapchatters can stay safe. This includes in-app resources, like Here for You and Heads Up, as well as collaborations with safety stakeholders. We also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in response to valid legal processes concerning activities on Snapchat that may provide evidence of a crime.

### 

Takeaway

Doing our part to promote public safety and protect Snapchatters from potentially harmful or illegal activities is a responsibility we take very seriously.

As we continue these efforts, we are committed to providing transparent insights into the effectiveness of our approach. Through our Transparency Reports, we provide country-level information related to our enforcements against illegal or regulated activities. To provide additional detail, we’ve broken out our reporting and enforcement data for illicit drug- and weapons-related violations in our Transparency Report, and we plan to provide more detailed breakdowns of these violations in our future reports.

We encourage users to report instances of illegal activity to help keep Snapchat safe and healthy. We are always looking for opportunities to improve our ability to address potentially harmful content or behavior, and we are committed to working with diverse leaders from across the safety community to help ensure we are advancing these objectives responsibly.

Community Guidelines

Hateful Content, Terrorism, and Violent Extremism


=====================================================

Community Guidelines Explainer Series

Updated: February 2025

### 

Overview

Hateful content and activities that support terrorism or violent extremism have no place on Snapchat. Our policies operate to create an environment that supports and prioritizes the safety and well-being of Snapchatters, and to protect communities from violence and discrimination.

It is never acceptable to engage in hateful conduct, including the use of hate speech or hate symbols. Activities that support or advocate for acts of terrorism or violent extremism are similarly prohibited and, if warranted, may be reported to law enforcement.

To help ensure these policies are enforced responsibly, our teams consult the expertise and work of civil rights organizations, human rights experts, law enforcement agencies, NGOs, and safety advocates. We are routinely learning, and will calibrate wherever necessary to help ensure that our products and policies function to keep Snapchatters safe. To help us, we encourage users to promptly report any hateful content or activity that may violate our policies against terrorism and violent extremism.

### 

What you should expect

Snapchatters should feel safe and respected when using our products. Our policies against hateful content prohibit the following: 

* Terrorist organizations, violent extremists, and hate groups. These entities are prohibited from using our platform. We have no tolerance for content that advocates or advances violent extremism or terrorism.
    
* All content that promotes terrorism or other violent, criminal acts committed by individuals or groups to further ideological goals. These rules also prohibit any content that promotes or supports foreign terrorist organizations or extremist hate groups––as designated by credible, third-party experts––as well as recruitment for such organizations or violent extremist activities.
    
* Hate speech or content that demeans, defames, or promotes discrimination or violence on the basis of race, color, caste, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or veteran status, immigration status, socio-economic status, age, weight, or pregnancy status. These rules prohibit, for example, the use of racial, ethnic, misogynistic, or homophobic slurs. They also prohibit memes that ridicule or call for discrimination against a protected group and intentional deadnaming or misgendering. Hate speech also includes endorsing perpetrators––or disparaging victims––of human tragedies (such as genocide, apartheid, or slavery). Other prohibited hateful content includes the use of hate symbols, which means any imagery that is intended to represent hatred or discrimination toward others.
    

### 

Takeaway

We do not tolerate hateful content, terrorism, or violent extremism on Snapchat. Through our policies and our product design, we work diligently to maintain an environment that supports and prioritizes the safety of Snapchatters.

Users can help us protect our community by reporting any content that violates our policies. We are also committed to working with diverse leaders from across the safety community to help ensure we are advancing our safety objectives responsibly.

Community Guidelines

Harassment and Bullying


===========================

Community Guidelines Explainer Series

Updated: February 2025

### 

Overview

Bullying and harassment are counter to Snapchat’s values. These harms can take many forms, so we use a multifaceted approach to help combat them. Along with our policy and enforcement, we use product safety mitigations and provide resources to users.

As a baseline, our policies prohibit demeaning, defamatory, or discriminatory content and conduct. We also prohibit sharing private information or Snaps of people in private settings without their knowledge or consent-- especially of members of vulnerable populations including minors, older adults, or those in medical or assisted living facilities.

In addition to enforcing these policies consistently, we use our product design to help limit harmful behavior that may violate these rules. For example, we use default settings that require both friends to accept a connection before they can message each other.

### 

What you should expect

Violations of our harassment and bullying policies include any unwanted behavior that could cause an ordinary person to experience emotional distress. These rules also require users to respect each other’s personal privacy. Violations of these rules include the following:

* Verbal abuse, threats, or any behavior meant to shame, embarrass, or humiliate the target.  
    
* Sharing another person’s private information and Snaps of people in private spaces — like a bathroom, bedroom, locker room, medical facility, or assisted living facility – without their knowledge or consent.  
    

To help avoid violations, we encourage Snapchatters not to take photos or videos of people without their permission, and to avoid sharing private information about other people, like their home address, birthdate, phone numbers, etc. If someone blocks you on Snapchat, you may not contact them from another account. If someone is depicted in your Snap and asks you to remove it, please do! Respect the privacy rights of others. 

We encourage users to report when they experience or observe violations of these rules. Our moderation teams aim to ensure that each user feels safe and comfortable using Snapchat and, by reporting bad behavior, users can help us advance that goal.

### 

Takeaway

We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any kind. We want our users to feel safe while using Snapchat. If you ever feel uncomfortable, please do not hesitate to send us a report and block the other user––these features are provided for your safety. Through our Here for You portal, we help ensure users have access to in-app resources and information to help recognize and address bullying and harassment. We also provide tools to facilitate easy reporting of any violating behavior on Snapchat.

Please be considerate of people’s dignity and privacy––if they express discomfort, respect their boundaries. If they ask you to remove content about them, please do, and generally refrain from sharing images of people or information about them without their permission.

Sexual Content


==================

Community Guidelines Explainer Series

Updated: February 2025

### 

Overview

We strive to protect Snapchatters from unsolicited sexual content or abuse. Our policies prohibit sexual exploitation of any kind – including the sexual exploitation of children. We also prohibit sexual harassment and sharing, promoting, or distributing sexually explicit content and conduct, including pornography, sexual nudity, or offers of sexual services.

### 

What you should expect

We prohibit the following sexual harms: 

* Any activity that involves sexual exploitation or abuse of a minor, including sharing child sexual exploitation or abuse imagery, grooming for sexual purposes, sexual extortion (sextortion), or the sexualization of children. Never post, save, send, forward, distribute, or ask for nude or sexually explicit content involving anyone under the age of 18 (this includes sending or saving such images of yourself). We report any child sexual exploitation that we’ve identified, including attempts to engage in such conduct, to the appropriate authorities, including the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in line with legal requirements. 
    
* Any communication or behavior that attempts to persuade, trick, or coerce a minor with the intent of sexual abuse or exploitation, or which leverages fear or shame to keep a minor silent.
    
* All other forms of sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking, sextortion, and deceptive sexual practices, including efforts to coerce or entice users to provide nudes. 
    
* Producing, sharing, or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)––including sexual photos or videos taken or shared without permission, as well as “revenge porn” or behavior that threatens to share, exploit, or expose individuals’ intimate images or videos without their consent.
    
* All forms of sexual harassment. This may include making unwanted advances, sharing graphic and unsolicited content, or sending obscene requests or sexual invitations to other users.
    
* Promoting, distributing, or sharing pornographic content, including photos, videos, or even highly realistic animation, drawings, or other renderings of explicit sex acts, or nudity where the primary intention is sexual arousal.
    
* Offers of sexual services, including both offline services (such as, for example, erotic massage) and online experiences (such as, for example, offering sexual chat or video services).
    

  
We do allow for non-sexual nudity in certain contexts, such as breastfeeding, medical procedures, and other similar depictions.

### 

Takeaway

We prohibit sexual exploitation and sexually explicit content of any kind. We report child sexual exploitation to the appropriate authorities, in line with legal requirements. We want users to feel safe and comfortable using Snap. If you ever feel unsafe, do not hesitate to reach out to local law enforcement, if applicable, and block offending users. We also encourage you to [report](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012399221652-How-do-I-report-abuse-or-illegal-content-on-Snapchat?lang=en-US) violating content or accounts to Snapchat so we can take appropriate action.

Community Guidelines

Harmful False or Deceptive Practices


========================================

Community Guidelines Explainer Series

Updated: February 2025

### 

Overview

Fostering a responsible information environment has been a major priority at Snap. Deceptive practices take on many forms and can undermine trust and pose a threat to Snapchatters’ safety and security. Our policies are intended to reduce the spread of misinformation, and protect users from fraud and spam, across a broad range of circumstances.

* We prohibit spreading false information that causes harm or is malicious, such as denying the existence of tragic events, unsubstantiated medical claims, undermining the integrity of civic processes, or manipulating content for false or misleading purposes (including through generative AI or deceptive editing).
    
* We prohibit pretending to be someone (or something) that you’re not, or attempting to deceive people about who you are. This includes impersonating your friends, peers, celebrities, brands, or other individuals or organizations.
    
* We prohibit fraud and deceptive practices, including scams, money laundering, and the promotion of fraudulent goods and services.
    
* We prohibit spam, including unsolicited or artificially inflated content or engagement.
    

### 

What you should expect

Our Community Guidelines relating to Harmful False or Deceptive Practices cover distinct, but related, categories of harm: (1) harmful false information, (2) fraud, and 3) spam.

_1\. Harmful False Information_

Content that distorts facts can have harmful consequences for users and for society. We know it can sometimes be tough to know what’s accurate, particularly when it comes to fast-breaking current events, or complicated matters of science, health, and world affairs. For this reason, our policies focus not only on whether information is inaccurate or misleading, but also its potential for harm.

There are several categories of information in which the misrepresentation of facts can pose unique dangers. Across these areas, our teams take action against content that is misleading or inaccurate, irrespective of whether the misrepresentations are intentional. In this way, our policies operate against all forms of information threats, including misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, and manipulated media.

Examples of the information categories that we view as particularly vulnerable to harm include:

* **_Content that denies the existence of tragic events_****.** We prohibit content that disputes, for example, the Holocaust, or denies the events of the Sandy Hook school shooting in the U.S. Misrepresentations and unfounded theories regarding such tragedies may contribute to violence and hate, in addition to harming users whose lives and families have been impacted by such events.
    
* **_Content that promotes unsubstantiated medical claims._** We prohibit content that, for example, recommends untested therapies for preventing the spread of COVID-19; that features unfounded theories about vaccines; or that promotes debunked, harmful practices such as so-called “conversion therapy.” While the field of medicine is ever-changing, and public health agencies may often revise guidance, such credible organizations are subject to standards and accountability and we may look to them to provide a benchmark for responsible health and medical guidance.
    
* **_Content that undermines the integrity of civic processes._** Elections and other civic processes play an essential role in the functioning of rights-respecting societies, and also present unique targets for information manipulation. To safeguard the information environment around such events, we enforce our policies to apply to the following types of threats to civic processes:
    
* _Procedural interference:_ misinformation related to actual election or civic procedures, such as misrepresenting important dates and times or eligibility requirements for participation.
    
* _Participation interference:_ content that includes intimidation to personal safety or spreads rumors to deter participation in the electoral or civic process.
    
* _Fraudulent or unlawful participation:_ content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to participate in the civic process or to illegally cast or destroy ballots.
    
* _Delegitimization of civic processes:_ content aiming to delegitimize democratic institutions on the basis of false or misleading claims about election results, for example.
    

  
Our policies against harmful false information are complemented by extensive product design safeguards and advertising rules that limit virality, promote transparency, and elevate the role of authenticity across our platform. For more information on the ways our platform architecture supports these objectives, visit this [blog post](https://values.snap.com/news/how-we-prevent-the-spread-of-false-information-on-snapchat?lang=en-US).  
  

_2\. Fraud_

Fraud can expose Snapchatters to financial harm, cybersecurity risks, and even legal risk. To help reduce these risks, we prohibit deceptive practices that undermine trust in our community.

Prohibited practices include content that promotes scams of any kind; get-rich-quick schemes; unauthorized or undisclosed paid or sponsored content; multilevel marketing or pyramid schemes; and the promotion of fraudulent goods or services, including counterfeit goods or documents. We also prohibit money laundering (including money couriering or money muling) of any kind. This includes receiving and transferring money that's illegally obtained or from an unknown source on behalf of someone else, unauthorized and illegal money transmission or currency exchange services, and soliciting and promoting these activities.

Finally, our policies prohibit pretending to be someone (or something) that you’re not, or attempting to deceive people about who you are. This includes impersonating your friends, peers, celebrities, brands, or other organizations. These rules also mean that it’s a violation to imitate Snapchat or Snap, Inc., branding.

  

_3\. Spam_

Spam can be confusing and annoying to Snapchatters. We prohibit such practices, including artificially inflating engagement, such as pay-for-follower schemes or other follower-growth schemes; promoting spam applications; or mass, repetitive, or frequent posting or sharing.

### 

Takeaway

Doing our part to promote a responsible information environment remains a priority across our company, and we will continue to explore innovative approaches to help protect Snapchatters from the risks of Harmful False or Deceptive Practices.

As we continue these efforts, we are committed to providing transparent insights into the effectiveness of our approach. Through our transparency reports, we provide country-level information related to our enforcements against misinformation globally -- and we plan to provide more detailed breakdowns of these violations in future reports.

We are committed to regularly calibrating the operation of our policies to improve our ability to address harmful content or behavior, and we are committed to working with diverse leaders from across the global safety community to help ensure we are advancing these objectives responsibly.
