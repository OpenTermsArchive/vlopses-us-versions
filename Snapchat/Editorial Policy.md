1\. Introduction


--------------------

Where do these Content Guidelines apply?  

Snapchat is primarily a visual messaging app built to help people communicate with their family and friends. But there are parts of the app where public content may reach a wider audience via algorithmic recommendations; such content is defined as Recommended Content. For example:

*   On the Stories tab, Snapchatters can view recommended content from professional media partners and popular creators.
    
*   On Spotlight, Snapchatters can watch content created and submitted by our community.
    
*   On the Map, Snapchatters can see Snaps of events, breaking news and more from around the world.
    

**All content everywhere on Snapchat, public or private, must adhere to our** [**Community Guidelines**](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) **and** [**Terms of Service**](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US)**.**

In order to be eligible for algorithmic recommendation beyond the creator’s friends or subscribers (for example, on Stories, Spotlight, or the Map), Content must meet the additional, stricter standards described in the Content Guidelines on this page.

How are these Content Guidelines applied?

We enforce these Content Guidelines with moderation using a blend of technology and human review. We also provide in-app tools for Snapchatters to report content that they find objectionable. We respond to user reports quickly, and we use feedback to improve the content experience for all Snapchatters.

The guidelines for recommendation eligibility in these Content Guidelines apply equally to content from any source, be it a partner, individual creator, or an organization of any kind.

Snap's Reservation of Rights

We reserve the right to apply these Content Guidelines at our discretion and to take any action to enforce them, which may include, among other things, removing, limiting distribution, suspending, limiting promotion or age-gating your content.

Creators or Partners that violate our [Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines?lang=en-US) or [Terms of Service](https://www.snap.com/terms?lang=en-US) will be deemed in violation of these Content Guidelines.

Additionally, all content must comply with applicable law anywhere it’s distributed and the terms of our content agreement with you. Where we believe the foregoing has been violated, we reserve all rights to remove the offending content.

Personalization and Sensitive Content

Snapchatters represent a diverse range of ages, cultures and beliefs, and we want to provide a safe, healthy, valuable experience for all users, including those as young as 13. Recognizing that many Snapchatters may see content without actively choosing to do so, we designed these guidelines to protect Snapchatters from experiences that may be unsuitable or unwanted.

Within the pool of Recommended Content, we strive to personalize recommendations, especially for what we call “Sensitive” content. For example, Sensitive content may:

*   Depict acne treatments which may seem gross to some Snapchatters, while others may find it useful or fascinating; or
    
*   Feature people in swimwear in a manner that may seem sexually suggestive, depending on the context or the viewer.
    

While some Sensitive Content is eligible for recommendation, we may avoid recommending it to certain Snapchatters based on their age, location, preferences, or other criteria. Please note that the Sensitive criteria in these Content Guidelines should serve as a non-exhaustive list of examples. We may restrict or decline to recommend any content based on moderation history, user feedback, engagement signals, or our own editorial discretion.

2\. Quality


---------------

Prohibited:

**We prohibit:**

*   **Polls that ask questions about sensitive personal information.** This includes, but is not limited to, users' racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, personal health or sex life.
    

Not Eligible for Recommendation:

All content should be produced in a manner that is consistent with reasonable industry best practices. The following are not eligible for recommendation:

*   **Substandard Video Quality**, such as blurry low-resolution or overly pixelated imagery, incorrect orientation that would require a user to rotate their screen from vertical to horizontal, videos that mistakenly lack audio, etc.
    
*   **Flashes or strobes** without a warning for photosensitive users.
    
*   **Illegible or inscrutable Partner Tile text**. This applies to logos or headlines that may be hard to read due to issues with capitalization, punctuation, symbols or emojis.
    
*   **Off-platform links** (URLs, QR codes, etc.) to other messaging services, social media platforms, or cloud storage servers. You are free to link to other social media platforms on your own story or profile, but that will not be eligible for promotion. (Note: in Discover, we make exceptions for certain trusted URLs on Snaps within a user’s Story, but those Snaps are not eligible to be featured as Tiles.)
    
*   **Promotion of accounts** on other messaging services or social media platforms. For example, a username paired with the name or logo of a different social media or messaging app. (Note: we make exceptions when a Snap is attributing content to the original creator and adding original, transformative commentary).
    
*   **Unoriginal content**
    
    *   Posting content that you did not create, and that you have not transformed in a creative way (via commentary, reactions, etc.)
        
    *   Low-effort “reaction” content that is merely a pretext to repost someone else’s content
        
    *   Repeatedly posting the same content, whether it’s your own or someone else’s, with minimal creative difference
        
    

Sensitive:

The following is eligible for recommendation only on limited surfaces (such as Discover), but not in Spotlight or on the Map:

*   **Off-platform links** (URLs, QR codes, etc.) to destinations that are _not_: other messaging services, other social media platforms, or cloud storage servers.
    

3\. Public Interest Content


-------------------------------

Expectations

Context matters. Some content that is newsworthy, educational, satirical, or the subject of public discourse may be allowed, even if it references or depicts things that might otherwise violate elements of our Content Guidelines. We apply editorial judgment in such cases, and we ask that you do the same. This means:

*   **Maintain standards for accuracy** through appropriate fact checking
    
*   **Age- and/or location-gate** in accordance with these Content Guidelines, when appropriate and available
    
*   **Avoid shocking Snapchatters** with graphic or disturbing content. When potentially-disturbing content is truly newsworthy, you must use a graphic content warning.
    

Political Content

Political Content is eligible for recommendation **only from trusted, pre-approved Partners or Creators**. This includes:

*   **Election-related content** about candidates or parties for public office, ballot measures or referendums, political action committees, and content that urges people to vote or register to vote.
    
*   **Advocacy or issue content** concerning issues or organizations that are the subject of debate on a local, national or global level, or of public importance.
    

4. Sexual Content


---------------------

**Not Eligible for Recommendation:** 

Any sexual content that is [prohibited in our Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/sexual-content?lang=en-US) is prohibited anywhere on Snapchat. For content to be eligible for recommendation to a wider audience, it must not contain:

*   **Nudity, sex acts, and sexual services**. Our Community Guidelines allow limited non-pornographic nudity (for example, in the context of breastfeeding or medical procedures) in a user’s private Story. But the Content Guidelines prohibit all nudity, in any context, even if not photographic or realistic (for example, paintings or AI-generated images). The Community Guidelines prohibit explicit renderings of sex acts; our Content Guidelines prohibit any depiction or imitation of a sex act, even when everyone involved is fully clothed and the gesture is meant as a joke or visual innuendo. Our Community Guidelines prohibit sexual solicitation of any kind; these Content Guidelines err on the side of over-enforcement (for example, a moderately suggestive Snap that directs Snapchatters to a separate account, platform or site will be denied amplification, even if we are unable to confirm that sexual solicitation is the intent).
    
*   **Sexual harassment and non-consensual sexual material.** These are prohibited platform-wide in our Community Guidelines. The Content Guidelines go beyond to prohibit insensitive or potentially-demeaning sexual content, such as sexual objectification and manipulated media that sexualizes someone without their consent (for example, editing a celebrity’s appearance to exaggerate certain sexualized body parts). We also prohibit speculation about someone’s gender or sexuality (for example, “Is \_\_\_ in the closet?”) and coverage of sex crimes or sexual taboos in a lurid, sensationalized format (for example, “10 Teachers Who Married Their Students”).
    
*   **Sexually explicit language.** While our Community Guidelines do not prevent Snapchatters from discussing adult topics privately or on their Stories, these Content Guidelines prohibit explicit language that describes sex acts, genitalia, sex toys, sex work, or sexual taboos (for example, incest or bestiality). This includes emojis in explicitly sexual contexts. It also includes innuendos that are specific enough to refer to particular sex acts or body parts.
    
*   **Overtly suggestive imagery.** While our Community Guidelines do not prevent Snapchatters from sharing non-explicit, risque imagery, these Content Guidelines prohibit imagery that emphasizes frequently-sexualized body parts (for example, breasts, rear, crotch) via the camera, attire, pose or other elements in a sexually provocative way. This applies even if the individual is not nude, or even if the individual is not a real person (such as animations or drawings). This includes disembodied closeups of sexualized body parts. This also includes simulated sexual activity, such as posing in sex positions, mimicking sex acts, displaying sex toys, or interacting with objects in a sexually provocative way.
    
*   **Minors in sexual situations.** Our Community Guidelines strictly prohibit all forms of child sexual exploitation. These Content Guidelines additionally prohibit edge-case content that may fall short of a legal definition of child sexual exploitation or abuse material. That means we deny amplification to any content, real or fictional, about romantic or sexual relationships between adults and minors, unless the specific incident is newsworthy because of its relevance to prominent issues, individuals or institutions. Even in newsworthy instances, coverage of minors in sexual situations must not be sensationalized, suggestive or exploitative. This also includes content, real or fictional, about sexual activity between minors. We allow:
    
    *   Content about teenagers’ sexual or gender identities, or their age-appropriate romantic relationships, as long as that content is not suggestive or explicit.
        
    *   Coverage of sex crimes or sexual harassment, as long as the coverage is newsworthy — meaning, that it is relevant to an already-prominent issue, individual or institution.
        
    

  
**Sensitive:** 

The following is eligible for recommendation, but we may choose to limit its visibility to certain Snapchatters based on their age, location, preferences, or other criteria.

*   **Revealing, non-nude body imagery**. This means imagery that may incidentally draw attention to frequently-sexualized body parts, but where overt sexual suggestiveness is not the intent (for example, scant or tight clothing in an activity-appropriate context, such as swimwear, fitness attire, red carpet events, runway fashion).
    
*   **Moderately suggestive language**. This includes subtle innuendo that indicates vague sexual interest without alluding to specific sex acts or specific body parts.
    
*   **Sexual health content** that is educational, focuses on safety, does not promote dangerous behavior and is suitable for Snapchatters as young as 13.
    
*   **Non-suggestive sexual content** in the context of news, public interest commentary, or education (for example, art history).
    
*   Content featuring individuals who are primarily known for their work in **adult entertainment.**
    

5. Harassment & Bullying


----------------------------

**Not Eligible for Recommendation:**

Any harassment or bullying that is [prohibited in our Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/harassment-and-bullying?lang=en-US) is prohibited anywhere on Snapchat, including in private content or on a Snapchatter’s Story. For content to be eligible for recommendation to a wider audience, it must not contain:

*   **Ambiguous attempts to embarrass or humiliate someone.** Our Community Guidelines prohibit all forms of harassment and bullying, but these Content Guidelines apply a stricter standard in ambiguous cases where the intent to embarrass is uncertain (for example, a Snap of a “roast” where it’s unclear if the subject wants to be mocked on camera). This extends to demeaning or belittling language. It also includes objectifying someone based on their appearance, even if they are a public figure.
    
    *   Note: criticizing or satirizing the _words or actions_ of prominent public adults or organizations would not be considered harassment or bullying.  
        Sexual harassment of any kind (see “Sexual Content,” above) is prohibited anywhere on Snapchat.
        
    
*   **Invasions of privacy.** Our Community Guidelines detail the types of private information that should not be shared. These Content Guidelines additionally prohibit sharing images of children, including the children of public figures, unless:
    
    *   they are a central part of newsworthy stories
        
    *   they are accompanying their parent or guardian at a public event
        
    *   the content was created with the consent from a parent or legal guardian.
        
    
*   **Wishing serious injury or death upon someone** (for example, “I hope my ex crashes their new car”).
    
*   **Profanity targeted at someone else.** Our Community Guidelines allow self-expression that uses profanity, but these Content Guidelines prohibit coarse language or profanity directed at an individual or group, even if it is bleeped or obscured, and even if it is not as severe as hate speech or sexual explicitness.
    
*   **Mean or dangerous pranks** that could cause the victim to believe they are in imminent danger of injury, death or loss.
    
*   **Insensitivity regarding tragic events or topics** (for example, mocking survivors of intimate partner violence)
    

6. Disturbing or Violent Content


------------------------------------

**Not Eligible for Recommendation:**

Any disturbing or violent content that is [prohibited in our Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/threats?lang=en-US) is prohibited anywhere on Snapchat. For content to be eligible for recommendation to a wider audience, it must not contain:

*   **Graphic or gratuitous imagery.** Our Community Guidelines prohibit graphic or gratuitous imagery of violence to humans or animals. These Content Guidelines prohibit graphic or gratuitous depictions of not only violence, but also severe illness, injury, or death. Our Community Guidelines do not prohibit content that depicts medical or cosmetic procedures (for example, pimple popping, ear cleaning, liposuction, etc.), but content is not eligible for recommendation if it depicts graphic imagery. “Graphic” in this context includes real-life imagery of bodily fluids or waste, such as pus, blood, urine, excrement, bile, infection, decay. We deny amplification to intentionally, viscerally disturbing human body imagery, such as sharp objects near the skin or eyes, or vermin near the mouth. While our Community Guidelines prohibit content that shows animal abuse, these Content Guidelines additionally prohibit imagery of severe animal suffering (for example, open wounds, emaciation, broken or mangled body parts) or death.
    
*   **Glorification of violence.** Our Community Guidelines prohibit expressing support for violence or encouraging violence against anyone. These Content Guidelines go further to prohibit even ambiguous support for or tacit approval of violence.
    
*   **Glorification of self-harm.** Our Community Guidelines prohibit the promotion of self-injury, suicide or eating disorders. These Content Guidelines go further to deny amplification to edge-case content (for example, jokingly saying, “Delete your account and kys,” or any “thinspo” or “pro-ana” content).
    
*   **Encouraging dangerous behavior** is prohibited in our Community Guidelines. These Content Guidelines deny amplification to content that depicts dangerous activities performed by non-professionals, such as stunts or “challenges” that could result in injury, illness, death, harm, or property damage.
    
*   **Lurid or sensationalized coverage** of disturbing incidents. Our Community Guidelines do not prohibit content about disturbing incidents, but these Content Guidelines deny amplification to content that focuses on non-newsworthy violent or sexual crimes or crimes that involve minors. For content to be considered “newsworthy,” it must be timely and involve a prominent individual, group or issue in the public interest.
    

**Sensitive:**

The following is eligible for recommendation, but we may choose to limit its visibility to certain Snapchatters based on their age, location, preferences, or other criteria.

*   **Violence** in the context of national news, education, or public discourse, where there is no graphic imagery of death or mutilation. Disturbing incidents, such as sexual or violent crimes, may be newsworthy when they are timely and involve a prominent prominent individual, group or issue in the public interest
    
*   **Discussion of overcoming self-harm**, including eating disorders.
    
*   **Non-graphic depictions of health issues**, procedures, medical settings or equipment. This includes preserved body organs in educational or newsworthy contexts.
    
*   **Cosmetic procedures** where the skin is not broken.
    
*   **Body modification** such as tattoo needles on skin or piercings in progress.
    
*   **Animals in danger or distress in natural settings**, without graphic imagery of death or gore.
    
*   **Species that trigger common phobias**, such as spiders, insects, or snakes.  
    Fictional but realistic and potentially disturbing imagery. This includes violence in entertainment contexts (for example, in a movie, video game or comedy skit). This also includes horror-themed content (for example, special effects makeup, costumes, props). It also includes imagery meant to provoke a visceral reaction (for example, porous objects to trigger trypophobia, glue to simulate peeling skin, or seeds to simulate ticks).
    
*   **Profanity** when it is not directed at an individual, not derogatory to a group, and not in a sexually explicit context. This applies to expletives commonly used to express general frustration (for example, “s\*\*\*” and “f\*\*\*”).
    

7\. False or Deceptive Information


--------------------------------------

**Not Eligible for Recommendation:**

Any harmful false information that is [prohibited in our Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/harmful-false-information?lang=en-US) is prohibited anywhere on Snapchat. Creators and Partners are responsible for fact-checking their content. Creators and Partners are prohibited from publishing inaccurate or misleading content, whether the subject matter is serious (politics, health, tragic events) or more frivolous (entertainment gossip, hoaxes, etc.). For content to be eligible for recommendation to a wider audience, it must not contain:

*   **Political false or unsubstantiated information.** Our Community Guidelines prohibit political false information, such as erroneous information about voting, misrepresentations of a candidate’s positions or other content that undermines civic processes. There may be instances where our review teams are unable to verify whether a political claim is true, false, or potentially misleading. Ambiguous content may be allowed among friends or followers, but will not be eligible for recommendation.
    
*   **Health-related false or unsubstantiated information.** Such content is prohibited in our Community Guidelines, which means it is also prohibited in these Content Guidelines.
    
*   **Denial of tragic events.** Such content is prohibited in our Community Guidelines, which means it is also prohibited in these Content Guidelines.
    
*   **Manipulated media that is false or misleading**. Our Community Guidelines focus on manipulated media’s potential for _harm_ (for example, a deep fake of a politician doing something embarrassing). Our Content Guidelines go further to deny amplification to false or misleading information even where there is no obvious risk to society. For example, clickbait tile images that use photo editing tools or AI to depict a snake the size of a bus, or that edit actors into costumes to spread completely unfounded casting rumors; these examples may not threaten civic integrity or public health, but they are misleading.
    
*   **Deceptive impersonations of other people, brands or organizations.** Such content is prohibited in our Community Guidelines, and these Content Guidelines go further to prohibit ambiguous or unclear impersonation. Satire, parody and commentary are allowed, but the reality of content authorship must be reasonably clear to a viewer as young as 13.
    
*   **Deceptive marketing tactics of any kind**. We prohibit links with excessive redirects or links that generate pop-ups or pop-unders or excessive ad load. You may not change the end destination or landing page of a link after you have displayed it in your content. Any links in your content must also comply with our Content Guidelines.
    
*   **Engagement bait**. This means content where the intent is not to entertain or inform the viewer, but to manipulate them to boost the Snap’s views or interactions. Engagement bait often sets up an expectation that never pays off. Here is a non-exhaustive list of examples of prohibited engagement bait:
    
    *   A “wait for it” caption, but “it” never happens.
        
    *   Challenges based on nonexistent Snapchat features, such as, “Snapchat won’t let you like this 10 times.”
        
    *   Attempts to leverage likes or shares, such as, “If this gets 20,000 likes, I’ll shave my head.”
        
    *   Attempts to trick people into re-watching or pausing a Snap via long blocks of text, brief glimpses of something, or “spot the difference” games.
        
    *   Misleading or sensationalized headlines or Tiles, such as unfounded casting rumors, presenting a celebrity’s years-old arrest as breaking news, editing an image of someone’s body or face to imply a radical transformation, etc.
        
    

8\. Illegal or Regulated Activities


---------------------------------------

**Not Eligible for Recommendation:**

Illegal or regulated activities, products or services that are [prohibited in our Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/illegal-or-regulated-activities?lang=en-US) are prohibited anywhere on Snapchat. For content to be eligible for recommendation to a wider audience, it must not:

*   **Facilitate or promote illegal activity.** Such content is prohibited in our Community Guidelines, which means it is also prohibited in these Content Guidelines.
    
*   **Depict tobacco, nicotine, or cannabis products or paraphernalia.** While our Community Guidelines do not prohibit Snaps of adults using these products in places where they are legal, these Content Guidelines deny amplification to such content.
    
*   **Depict dangerous alcohol use.** While our Community Guidelines do not prohibit Snaps of adults consuming alcohol, these Content Guidelines deny amplification to content that shows excessive or dangerous alcohol use by an adult, such as rapidly consuming large quantities of alcohol, or operating heavy machinery while intoxicated or while alcohol is present, or drinking to the point of slurred speech or loss of consciousness.
    
*   **Depict real modern lethal weapons** (guns, combat knives, explosives, etc.) outside of a news, education, or sports context.
    
    *   Historical weapons (catapults, blunderbusses, swords, etc.) are allowed.
        
    *   Fictional weapons (cosplay props, video game weapons, etc.) are allowed.
        
    
*   **Promote certain regulated goods or services.** Our [Commercial Content Policy](https://www.snap.com/terms/commercial-content) explains how Snapchatters may share commercial content with their friends or followers, including content that requires targeting based on age or location. But in order to be eligible for recommendation, content must not promote these regulated areas:
    
    *   Residential real estate
        
    *   Employment opportunities
        
    *   Gambling, real money gaming/betting, lotteries, sweepstakes
        
    *   Unrealistic claims about potential health benefits of a product or service; any promotion of supplements, pharmaceuticals, or weight loss products
        
    *   Loans, investments, credit, cryptocurrencies, NFTS, or any other financial products or services
        
    *   Alcohol
        
    *   Tobacco, cannabis and their derivatives (nicotine, THC/CBD products) or paraphernalia (vapes, etc.)
        
    *   Explosives, fireworks, pyrotechnics, demolition devices
        
    *   Dating apps, sites or services
        
    

**Sensitive:**

The following is eligible for recommendation, but we may choose to limit its visibility to certain Snapchatters based on their age, location, preferences, or other criteria.

*   **Moderate alcohol use by adults.**
    
*   **Weight loss programs or techniques.**
    
    *   Fitness content is allowed for all audiences when it focuses on strength, conditioning or mobility instead of focusing on weight loss.
        
    
*   **Fictional references to illegal or regulated activities** (for example, jokes, skits, scenes from movies or video games)
    

9\. Hateful Content, Terrorism, and Violent Extremism


---------------------------------------------------------

**Not Eligible for Recommendation:**

Any Hateful Content, Terrorism, and Violent Extremism that is [prohibited in our Community Guidelines](https://values.snap.com/privacy/transparency/community-guidelines/hateful-content?lang=en-US) is prohibited anywhere on Snapchat. For content to be eligible for recommendation to a wider audience, it must not contain:

*   **Content from, or promoting, Terrorist organizations, violent extremists, or hate groups.** Such content is prohibited in our Community Guidelines, which means it is also prohibited in these Content Guidelines.
    
*   **Hate speech.** Our Community Guidelines prohibit content that demeans, defames, or promotes discrimination or violence on the basis of race, color, caste, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or veteran status, immigration status, socio-economic status, age, weight or pregnancy status. These Content Guidelines go further to prohibit content that is ambiguously demeaning to any of the protected categories listed above. If it is unclear whether content is intended as a “dog whistle” for discriminatory beliefs, we err on the side of not promoting such content.
    

Sensitive:

The following is eligible for recommendation, but we may choose to limit its visibility to certain Snapchatters based on their age, location, preferences, or other criteria:

*   The use of **“reclaimed” slurs by in-group members** of the target of the slur.
    
*   Hate speech or symbols in the contexts of **counter-speech, news, education, history, fiction**
    

10\. Commercial Content


---------------------------

Our [Commercial Content Policy](https://www.snap.com/terms/commercial-content) applies to any content on Snapchat that is not a traditional advertisement served by Snap, but is is sponsored by, promotes, or advertises any brand, product, good, or service (including your own brand or business), and content you have been incentivized to post by receiving monetary payment or free gifts.

Commercial content is not eligible for recommendation if:

*   **It violates any part of our** [**Commercial Content policy**](https://www.snap.com/terms/commercial-content)**.**
    
*   **It does not disclose its commercial nature.** Snap offers a “paid partnership” disclosure tool and profile-level age and location targeting tools to help Creators, Partners and brands comply with 1) local laws, 2) our [Advertising Policies](https://www.snap.com/ad-policies) and 3) our [Commercial Content Policy](https://www.snap.com/terms/commercial-content). We require the use of these tools where applicable.
