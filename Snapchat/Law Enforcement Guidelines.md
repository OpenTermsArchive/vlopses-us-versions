Information for Law Enforcement

Law Enforcement and the Snap Community

At Snap, we take our commitment to protecting Snapchatters from misuse of our platform very seriously. As part of that, we work with law enforcement and governmental agencies to promote safety on our platform.

Snap is committed to assisting law enforcement while respecting the privacy and rights of our users. Once we have received and established the validity of a legal request for Snapchat account records, we respond in compliance with applicable law and privacy requirements.

General Information for Law Enforcement

These operational guidelines are provided for law enforcement and governmental officials who are seeking to request Snapchat account records (i.e., Snapchat user data) from Snap. Additional information relating to law enforcement requests can be found in our [Law Enforcement Guide](https://snapchat.com/lawenforcement?lang=en-US), where you'll find details regarding possible availability of Snapchat account records and the type of legal process required to compel disclosure of that data.

U.S. Legal Process

As a U.S. company, Snap requires U.S. law enforcement and governmental agencies to follow U.S. law in order for Snap to disclose any Snapchat account records.

Our ability to disclose Snapchat account records is generally governed by the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701, et seq. The SCA mandates that we disclose certain Snapchat account records only in response to specific types of legal process, including subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants.

Non-U.S. Legal Process

Non-U.S. law enforcement and governmental agencies generally must rely on the mechanics of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or letters rogatory processes to request Snapchat account records from Snap. As a courtesy to non-U.S. law enforcement, we will review and respond to properly submitted preservation requests while the MLAT or letters rogatory process is undertaken.

Snap may, at its discretion, provide limited Snapchat account records to law enforcement and governmental agencies outside the U.S. in response to legal process that is duly authorized in the requesting country and that seeks non-content information such as basic subscriber information and IP data.

Emergency Disclosure Requests

Consistent with 18 U.S.C. §§ 2702(b)(8) and 2702(c)(4), we are able to voluntarily disclose Snapchat account records when we believe in good faith that an emergency posing a threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury requires the immediate disclosure of such records.

Information for law enforcement regarding how to submit Emergency Disclosure Requests to Snap can be found in our [Law Enforcement Guide](https://snapchat.com/lawenforcement?lang=en-US). Emergency Disclosure Requests to Snap must be submitted by a sworn law enforcement official and must come from an official law enforcement (or governmental) email domain.

Data Retention Periods

Current information about data retention policies for Snaps, Chats and Stories, as well as other useful information, may be found on our [Support Site](https://support.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US).

Preservation Requests

We honor formal requests from law enforcement to preserve information in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 2703(f). Upon receiving such a request, we will attempt to preserve any available Snapchat account records that are associated with any properly identified Snapchat user(s) and that are within the date range specified in the request. We will maintain any such preserved records in an offline file for up to 90 days, and will extend that preservation for one additional 90-day period with a formal extension request. Please see [Section IV of our Law Enforcement Guide](https://snapchat.com/lawenforcement?lang=en-US) for more information on accurately locating a Snapchat account.

As a courtesy for non-U.S. law enforcement, Snap may, at its discretion, preserve available Snapchat account records for up to a year while the MLAT or letters rogatory process is undertaken. At its discretion, Snap may extend such a preservation for one additional six-month period with a formal extension request.

Child Safety Concerns

In instances where we're made aware of potential child exploitation content on our platform, our Trust & Safety team reviews the allegations and, if appropriate, reports such situations to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC will then review those reports and coordinate with both global law enforcement agencies.

User Consent

Snap does not disclose user data based solely on user consent. Users seeking to download their own data may find additional information on our [Support Site](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/download-my-data?lang=en-US).

User Notice Policy

Snap’s policy is to notify our users when we receive legal process seeking disclosure of their records. We recognize two exceptions to this policy. First, we will not notify users of legal process where providing notice is prohibited by a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or by other legal authority. Second, where we, in our sole discretion, believe an exceptional circumstance exists — such as cases involving child exploitation, the sale of lethal drugs, or the threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury — we reserve the right to forgo user notice.

Testimony

Records disclosures made to U.S. law enforcement will be accompanied by a signed Certificate of Authenticity, which should eliminate the need for the testimony of a custodian of records. Should you believe that a custodian of records is still necessary to provide testimony, we require domestication of all state subpoenas pursuant to the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of a Witness from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, Cal. Penal Code § 1334, et seq.

Snap is unable to provide expert witness testimony or testimony outside the United States.

How to Submit Requests

Law enforcement officials must address their requests to Snap Inc. Please be sure to identify the Snapchat username of the requested Snapchat account. If you are unable to locate a username, we can try — with varying degrees of success — to locate the account with a phone number, email address, or hexadecimal User ID. Please see [Section IV of our Law Enforcement Guide](https://snapchat.com/lawenforcement?lang=en-US) for more information on accurately locating a Snapchat account.

Law enforcement and governmental agencies who have access to Snap’s Law Enforcement Service Site (LESS) should submit legal process and preservation requests to Snap via the LESS portal at: [less.snapchat.com](https://less.snapchat.com/?lang=en-US). In LESS, members of law enforcement and governmental agencies can create an account for the purpose of submitting requests and checking the status of submissions.

We also accept preservation requests, service of legal process, and general questions from law enforcement via email at **lawenforcement@snapchat.com.**

Receipt of law enforcement requests by these means is for convenience only and does not waive any objections or legal rights of Snap or its users.

Requests from Non-Governmental Entities

Please note that the above methods are only appropriate for law enforcement officials.  

If you are contacting Snap on behalf of an entity that is not associated with law enforcement and seeking to serve a criminal defense discovery demand, please note that such legal process must be personally served on Snap or our designated third-party agent (unless issued or domesticated within California). Out-of-state criminal defense discovery demands must be domesticated in California as required by law. If you are seeking to serve a civil discovery demand, please note that Snap does not accept service of such legal process through email; civil discovery demands must be personally served on Snap or our designated third-party agent. Out-of-state civil discovery demands must further be domesticated in California.

Sending Legal Process, Preservation Requests, and Related Inquiries



U.S. law enforcement and governmental agencies should submit legal process andpreservation requests to Snap via Snap’s Law Enforcement Service System (“LESS”):

less.snapchat.com.



We strongly encourage all members of U.S law enforcement and governmental agencies whohave not yet requested access to LESS to do so as it also provides you the ability to check on

the status of your submissions. To get started, visit https://less.snapchat.com/ and submit your

government-issued email address. You will then receive an email from no_reply@snapchat.comto your government-issued email address with a link to the Law Enforcement Service System.Please note that the account creation process may take some time as we verify registrants forsecurity purposes, but you may continue to communicate with us via

lawenforcement@snapchat.com until your account has been created.

We are currently working to introduce LESS to designated single-point-of-contact (SPOC)members of non-U.S. law enforcement. If LESS has already been introduced in your location,please note that it is the optimal method by which to communicate with Snap.



If you do not yet have access to LESS, we can accept service of legal process and preservationrequests – and receive general questions – from members of law enforcement via email (from

an official government email domain only) to lawenforcement@snapchat.com. Please note that

we do not accept service of process or respond to questions from private email domains (e.g.,Gmail, Yahoo).



Receipt of law enforcement requests by the means listed above is for convenience only anddoes not waive any objections or legal rights of Snap or Snapchat users.



Snap is prohibited by California law from responding to legal process relating to allegedviolations of laws that create liability for, or arise out of, providing, facilitating, or obtaining anabortion or intending or attempting to provide, facilitate, or obtain an abortion that is lawfulunder California law. Accordingly, please be advised that Snap does not accept such legalprocess through the means described above.



Please note that we will not respond to correspondence from non-law enforcement ornon-governmental officials submitted through the channels described above.

I. Snap and Law Enforcement Overview



Snapchat is a visual messaging app made by Snap Inc. (“Snap”) that enhances relationshipswith friends, family, and the world. Snapchat empowers people to express themselves, live inthe moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. Snapchat is available as a mobileand web application; the mobile app is available through the iPhone App Store and GooglePlay Store, while the web application can be accessed at web.snapchat.com.



This Guide provides information for law enforcement officials seeking Snapchat accountrecords (i.e., Snapchat user data) from Snap. While we make every effort to keep this Guideup-to-date, please note there may be new products or features launched after this updatewhich are not addressed below. Questions that are not addressed in this Guide may be sent tolawenforcement@snapchat.com.



U.S. Legal Process Requirements



Snap discloses Snapchat account records solely in accordance with our Terms of Service, theStored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701,et seq. (“SCA”), and other applicable laws. TheSCA mandates that we disclose certain Snapchat account records only in response to specifictypes of legal process, including subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants. Generally, theSCA authorizes U.S. law enforcement and governmental entities to compel us to disclose basicsubscriber information, non-content account information, and account content (as described inSection V “Required Legal Process” below) in response to appropriate legal process. Snaprequires a valid order under the Pen Register Act, 18 U.S.C § 3121,et seq., or the Wiretap Act,18 U.S.C. § 2510,et. seq., or an equivalent state law, in order to provide metadata or contentinformation, respectively, on a prospective basis.



Non-U.S. Legal Process Requirements



Non-U.S. law enforcement generally must rely on the mechanics of the Mutual Legal AssistanceTreaty (“MLAT”), a CLOUD Act bilateral agreement, or letters rogatory processes to requestSnapchat account records from Snap. As a courtesy to non-U.S. law enforcement, we will reviewand respond to properly submitted preservation requests (see Section VI “PreservationRequests” below).



For legal requests submitted outside of those processes, Snap may – at its discretion andconsistent with the requirements of U.S. law – provide limited Snapchat account records to lawenforcement and governmental agencies outside the U.S. in response to legal process that isduly authorized in the requesting country and that seeks basic subscriber information and/or IPdata.

Additionally, Snap may – at its discretion and consistent with the requirements of U.S. law –provide limited non-content Snapchat account records to law enforcement outside of the U.S.on anemergency basis when we believe that doing so is necessary to prevent imminent deathor serious bodily injury to someone.



Support for Global Law Enforcement



Snap is committed to assisting law enforcement investigations as the law requires and thesafety of Snapchatters and others demands. Therefore, we provide email support to lawenforcement agencies for non-emergency matters and 24-hour online support for emergencysituations involving the threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury. Contact informationfor our Law Enforcement Operations Team is provided on Page 1 of this Guide.



Please note that Snap cannot provide legal advice to law enforcement. If you need clarificationabout the legal restrictions on providers like Snap, please contact the U.S. Department ofJustice’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (“CCIPS”).



Please also note that Snap cannot provide expert testimony, though we will endeavor, to thebest of our ability, to answer questions from law enforcement that are submitted to

lawenforcement@snapchat.com.



Content or Account Takedown Orders



Lawfully issued and legally valid orders for takedown of content or accounts may be submitted

via email to lawenforcement@snapchat.com.



For California Law Enforcement



For assistance and inquiries pursuant to CA Bus \& Prof Code § 22946.1, please select “GeneralSupport and Inquiries” from the LESS drop-down menu and follow the prompts.

II. Snap User Notice Policy



Snap’s policy is to notify Snapchatters when we receive U.S. legal process seeking thedisclosure of their records. Snap does not notify users when we are served with preservationrequests.



We recognize two exceptions to our user notice policy.



1. We will not notify users of legal process where providing notice is prohibited by a courtorder issued under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or by other legal authority. Non-disclosureorders must be duly authorized by a judge’s signature and must be for a finite duration.



2. We reserve the right to forgo user notice when we, in our sole discretion, believe anexceptional circumstance exists, such as cases involving child exploitation, the sale oflethal drugs, or the threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury.



To minimize delays related to our user notice policy, law enforcement should take one of thefollowing steps:



1. When submitting legal process using LESS, choose the appropriate choice from thedropdown menu to inform us that you have no objection to us notifying the affecteduser(s) of your legal process. This saves us the step of notifying you of Snap’s user noticepolicy and awaiting your confirmation that you have no objection, which means we canprocess your request more quickly.



2. Provide a court order issued in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or state law thatprohibits Snap from providing notice to the affected user(s). Ensure that thenon-disclosure order is connected to the applicable legal process by some uniqueidentifying information, such as a case number or Snapchat username(s). Please alsonote we do not recognize the validity of indefinite non-disclosure orders; all ordersprohibiting Snap from providing notice to the affected user(s) should include an enddate.



3. Inform us of an alternate, valid legal basis that prohibits Snap from providing notice tothe affected user(s).



4. Inform us if your case involves child exploitation, the sale of lethal drugs, or the threatof imminent death or serious bodily injury, and provide a sufficient factual basis for Snapto independently make that determination.



III. How Snapchat Works

The following is an overview of how the Snapchat app works. Snapchat is often introducingnew or improved features. The most up-to-date (and additional) product information is

available on the Snapchat Support Site at: https://help.snapchat.com.



Please note that the information provided below reflects the default settings of the Snapchatapp, but users may opt to change default settings to reduce the retention period of sometypes of data within the app.



Snaps



Snaps are photos or videos taken using the Snapchat app’s camera on an individual’s mobiledevice. Snaps may be shared either directly in a Chat with one or a group of the user’s friends,or shared in a Story (explained below).



Snapchatters can save a Snap message by pressing and holding on it to save while viewing ordirectly after viewing a Snap. After saving a Snap, the Snap will appear in the conversation asChat Media. (Chat Media is discussed in the Chat section below.)



Snap’s servers are designed to automatically delete a shared Snap after it has been opened by

all recipients. Please refer to our Support Page for more detailed information about retention of

Snaps.



Stories



A user can add Snaps, Memories, or images and video from their device camera roll to their“Story.” In general, users can manage their privacy settings so that their Story may be able tobe viewed by all Snapchatters, their friends, or a custom audience. Users can also elect tocreate other types of Stories, or to submit content to the Snap Map or Spotlight. For additionalinformation about Stories, or submitting to the Snap Map or Spotlight, please refer to our

Support Site.



Snap’s servers are currently designed to automatically delete the content in a user’s Story, bydefault, 24 hours after it is shared on Snapchat, but the user may delete part or all of the Storyearlier or they may, in certain instances, change their settings to have the Story visible longer.Submissions to the Snap Map and Spotlight may be saved for longer periods.



Memories



Memories is Snapchat’s cloud-storage service. Users can save their sent or unsent Snaps,posted Stories, and photos and videos from their device’s camera roll in Memories. Contentsaved in Memories is backed up by Snap and may remain in Memories until deleted by theuser. Users may choose to encrypt their content in Memories by saving it in “My Eyes Only,” in

which case the content is not accessible to Snap and cannot be decrypted by Snap. Pleasenote that because Memories functions as cloud storage, Snap will not provide Memories files inresponse to legal process that requests interpersonal communications.



Chat



A user can send text and send Snaps in Chat. A user may also send Memories, media uploadedfrom their device’s camera roll, or audio notes (collectively “Chat Media”) to friends within theSnapchat app using the Chat feature. Users can Chat one-on-one or in groups. Please refer to

this Support Page for more detailed information about retention of Chats. You can read more

about how Snapchatters can save and delete chats on this Support Page.



My AI is a chatbot currently available to Snapchatters. More information about My AI can be

found on this Support Page.



Location Data



If a user has device-level location services turned on and has opted into location services onSnapchat, Snap will collect location data from the device at various points during the user’s useof Snapchat. Retention periods for location data may vary depending on the purpose of thecollection. Users have some control over the deletion of their location data in the app settings.

You can learn more about Snap’s retention of location data on our Privacy by Product page,

specifically in the sections on Location and Snap Map.

IV. Identifying a Snapchat Account



Before sending Snap legal process seeking the preservation or disclosure of Snapchat accountrecords (i.e., Snapchat user data), law enforcement must first identify the username of theSnapchat account.Note: a Snapchat account’s username is often confused with an account’sdisplay name (sometimes also referred to as a “vanity name”). We cannot locate a Snapchataccount by a display name.



Snapchat Username



A Snapchat username is a unique identifier associated with a specific Snapchat account.Snapchat usernames may be changed by a user once every 365 days. Please note that thedecision of a user to change their username does not impact Snap’s ability to preserve ordisclose available user data pursuant to valid requests specifying either the former or the newusername.



Snapchat username attributes:

● Must be 3-15 characters long

● Must begin with a letter

● Can only contain letters, numbers, and the special characters hyphen ( - ), underscore( _ ), and period ( . )

● Cannot contain more than one of the above special characters

● Cannot end with a hyphen, underscore, or period

● Cannot contain spaces

● Cannot contain emojis or other symbols such as @, $, #, etc.

● Will appear only in lower-case letters within the app



Unlike a username, a display name is not a unique identifier and it can be changed repeatedlyby a Snapchatter, which changes how the display name appears to others within the app.Snapchatters can also change how friends’ display names appear to them on Snapchat –i.e.,customizing the app by assigning a different display name to a friend – similar to how one cancustomize contact names on a smartphone. Lastly, a display name can contain specialcharacters and symbols beyond hyphen, underscore, or period, as well as spaces, emojis, andcapital letters.

Example of Snapchat username and display name:



(A user's profile like the example above can be accessed in Snapchat by tapping on a user's profile image on theChat screen or in Search.)



In the example above, the username is “milliemanillie,” and the display name has been set to“Millie M,” which appears above the username. Note that there can be only one Snapchatterwith the username “milliemanillie” but there can be multiple Snapchatters with the displayname “Millie M.”



If a display name has not been created, one will not appear above the username.



If you are unsure if you have identified a valid Snapchat username, type the username into theSnapchat app “Search” screen to see if it appears. If the username does not appear, then theusername does not exist or the account may have been deleted.Note: some deleted Snapchataccounts may still have certain limited account records stored depending on various factors.



If you are unable to identify a Snapchat username, we can try to locate a Snapchat account witha current phone number (including country code) or email address if that information wasprovided by the user for their account. Phone numbers and email addresses can easily bechanged by users, so this information is not as reliable in identifying Snapchat users. Pleasealso note that Snapchatters are not required to maintain a verified phone number or emailaddress on their account.

Accounts may also be identified by the account’s hexadecimal User ID. If specifying a User ID,please submit with the characters in the 8-4-4-4-12 format, which is how such identifiers appearin Snap’s systems.



Note: we are unable to locate Snapchat accounts based on Snapchat display name, real name,date of birth, street address, Social Security number, or other identifiers not listed above. Norcan we locate accounts based on content or other media, or geographic location of a user at agiven time.

V. Required Legal Process



Sending Legal Process to Snap



As explained on page 1 under “Contact Information for Law Enforcement,” all law enforcementand governmental agencies who have access to Snap’s Law Enforcement Service System (LESS:

less.snapchat.com) should submit legal process and preservation requests through LESS.



Although we currently also accept service of legal process from law enforcement via email

(from an official government email domain) to lawenforcement@snapchat.com, utilizing LESS

will allow law enforcement to track submissions and may result in a quicker response time.



Legal Process Requirements Overview



Snap discloses Snapchat account records (i.e., Snapchat user data) to law enforcementon anon-emergency basis only if we receive legal process that complies with legal requirements.



The legal process should: be submitted in a non-editable static file (such as PDF); name “SnapInc.” as the Custodian of Records; and be signed and dated. To facilitate a response whenrequesting records regarding more than one Snapchat account (e.g., multiple usernames), suchrequests should be contained in a single piece of legal process (e.g., one subpoena). Snapmay, at its discretion, also request an explanation from law enforcement justifying the numberof accounts impacted by the legal process, if a single piece of legal process implicatesnumerous accounts.



Note: to facilitate the expedient and accurate handling of requests, if legal process seeksdisclosure of records regarding more than 10 Snapchat accounts, please provide an additionalcopy of your request in an editable format (such as DOCX or TXT). Failure to provide aneditable copy may delay our processing of the legal process.



When providing legal process requesting the disclosure of Snapchat account records, pleasespecify the following:

● Snapchat username, email address, phone number, or hexadecimal User ID (see SectionIV “Identifying a Snapchat Account” above)

○Note: law enforcement must include the international calling code if specifying anon-U.S. phone number.

● The specific type of data requested (see below)

● The target date range (“month/day/year to month/day/year”) and any applicabletimezone

○Note: records disclosed by Snap are provided in Coordinated Universal Time(“UTC”).

● Response contact information (including a governmental email address)

● If you object to us notifying affected Snapchatters and the reason for your objection(see Section II “Snap User Notice Policy” above)



The required legal process varies depending on the type of Snapchat account records you arerequesting, as described below. Please also see Section VI below regarding preservationrequests.



Basic Subscriber Information



Basic subscriber information is collected when a user creates a new Snapchat account or altersinformation at a later date, among other interactions with the Snapchat app. Basic subscriberinformation consists of the categories of information listed at 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2), which forSnap may include:



● Current and previous Snapchat usernames

● Current and previous email addresses associated with the account, and whether verifiedby user

● Current and previous phone numbers associated with the account, and whether verifiedby user

● Current and previous Snapchat display names

● Snapchat account creation date and IP address

● IP addresses (and timestamps) relating to various Snapchat account actions

● Certain information about the user’s use of Snapchat services and account settings



Note: Not all information listed above is required for a user to use the Snapchat app, and Snapdoes not independently verify user-provided subscriber information.



IP logs associated with Snapchat account logins, logouts, failed login attempts, authenticationevents, and Friend events are retained for a limited period of time both while an account isactive and after deletion of a Snapchat account. IP logs associated with a Snapchat account’sinteractions with the Snapchat “My AI” chatbot may be retained for longer.



Legal process required for basic subscriber information: law enforcement can obtain basicsubscriber information through a subpoena (including one issued by a grand jury); a court orderissued in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d); or a federal or state search warrant.



Communications Metadata



Logs may be available containing metadata about a user’s communications.

Legal process required for communications metadata: law enforcement can obtaincommunications metadata pursuant to a court order issued in accordance with 18 U.S.C.§ 2703(d) or a federal or state search warrant.



Non-Communications Metadata

Metadata not related to communications, such as Friends List or device identifier information,may also be available. Logs regarding Memories metadata may also be available.



Legal process required for non-communications metadata: law enforcement can obtainnon-communications metadata pursuant to a court order issued in accordance with 18 U.S.C.§ 2703(d) or a federal or state search warrant.



Location Data



Location data may be available for a Snapchatter who has enabled location services on theirdevice and opted into location services in the Snapchat app settings.



Currently, Snap can provide available geolocation data for an account as a whole, or withrespect to Memories metadata. Snap cannot provide geolocation data specifically requestinglocation associated with Snap Map posts or communications.



Legal process required for location data: law enforcement can obtain location data, to theextent available, pursuant to a federal or state search warrant.



Content



As explained in Section III “How Snapchat Works” above, Snap’s servers are designed toautomatically delete most user content by default, such as the content of communications,after a limited period of time, unless it is otherwise saved by a Snapchatter. An exception is thecontent contained within Memories which, when saved, may be available until deleted by auser. As noted earlier, content saved to the My Eyes Only section of Memories is encrypted,and cannot be decrypted by Snapchat.



Legal process required for content: law enforcement can obtain content, to the extentavailable, pursuant to a federal or state search warrant.

VI. Preservation Requests



A preservation is a snapshot in time of a user’s available data, including available basicsubscriber information, metadata, geolocation data, and content (e.g., Chats, Stories, andMemories). Because Snapchat user data is not typically retained for a long period, lawenforcement may want to expeditiously request the preservation of relevant data as soon aspossible after an alleged incident for which evidence is sought.



We honor requests from law enforcement to preserve information in accordance with 18 U.S.C.§ 2703(f). Upon receiving such a request, we will attempt to preserve for the date rangespecified in the request any available Snapchat account records associated with any properlyidentified Snapchat user(s) (see Section IV “Identifying a Snapchat Account” above). We willmaintain any such preserved records in an offline file for up to 90 days, and we will extend thatpreservation for one additional 90-day period with an extension request. If you require anextension, please submit a preservation extension request, indicating clearly that it is anextension request and not an original preservation request.



As a courtesy for non-U.S. law enforcement, Snap may, at its discretion, preserve availableSnapchat account records for up to one year while the MLAT or letters rogatory process isundertaken. At its discretion, Snap may extend such a preservation for one additional 180-dayperiod with an extension request.



Note: since 18 U.S.C. § 2703(f) does not contemplate “serial” preservation requests ormultiple extension requests beyond one additional 90-day period, we do not comply with suchrequests unless – in our sole discretion – we determine an exceptional circumstance exists.

VII. Emergency Disclosure Requests



U.S. and non-U.S. law enforcement officials seeking the emergency disclosure of Snapchataccount records should complete and submit Snap’s Law Enforcement Emergency Response

Tips for Effective Identification of Accounts in Legal Process

● Identify the account by username consistent with the Snapchat naming protocolsdescribed in Section IV above.

● Do not use ambiguous language such as “and/or” in identifying an account.

● Do not identify Snapchat usernames as associated to other identifiers, such as phonenumbers and email addresses, unless you are certain that they are in fact associated.

● Do not provide extraneous information that Snap cannot use to locate an account (e.g.,IP address, date of birth, given name, etc.).

● Ensure that fonts have clearly distinguishable letters and numbers (for example, avoidTimes New Roman in which a lower case L (l) is virtually indistinguishable from thenumber one (1).

● Always provide a country code for non-U.S. phone numbers when specifying a targetphone number.

● It’s best to avoid a date format that is ambiguous MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY. It willsave time if you instead spell out the month.
