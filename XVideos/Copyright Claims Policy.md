### ANTI-PIRACY STATEMENT

Many in the adult industry are concerned about the effect that unlawfully operated "tube" websites have on the business and the bottom line of individual studios. While not every site is alike, Xvideos has been proactive in fighting content theft and copyright infringement - more so than other tube sites - and has taken several steps to ensure not merely legal compliance, but to show loyalty and give proactive assistance to the online adult entertainment community. Rather than serving as a direct competitor, Xvideos operates as, and continuously aspires to be, a content delivery and marketing component for the broader adult industry. Xvideos seeks to be a responsible and cooperative member of this industry.

In order to fulfill that goal, Xvideos has evaluated all dimensions of its legal policies and acted to ensure compliance - and for the protection of content producers - in all aspects. For example, Xvideos was the first to implement fingerprinting technology to inhibit the uploading of infringing content owned by others. This fingerprinting solution is still operating today.

Although we are based outside North America and not governed by U.S. or Canadian law, we respect the rights of copyright owners and thus have implemented certain policies in an effort to voluntarily comply with anti-infringement laws. We reserve all rights and objections to the extraterritorial application of U.S., Canadian, or any other foreign law to our operations in any capacity. Nonetheless, we believe that protection of copyright owners' content can be best supported by voluntary compliance with anti-infringement laws. Compliance with such laws is of utmost importance to Xvideos. As such, Xvideos has a registered DMCA agent with the U.S. Copyright Office, and is otherwise compliant with various anti-infringement laws, including by expeditiously processing proper notices of alleged infringement. If you would like to submit a notification of infringement about a particular video, [click here](https://info.xvideos.net/takedown).

In addition, Xvideos allows its users to submit counter-notifications when their uploaded material has been mistakenly removed pursuant to a takedown notice. Xvideos sends all such all such counter-notifications to the complaining parties, as contemplated by DMCA.

Please note that Xvideos specifically reserves the right to pursue damages, costs and legal fees available by law in the event a copyright owner or a user submits a copyright infringement notice or counter-notice without a good faith belief regarding the infringing or non-infringing nature of particular content, or to the extent an individual submitting a notice or counter-notice makes any material misrepresentations to Xvideos.

Finally, Xvideos has implemented a robust and comprehensive repeat infringer policy. In an effort to voluntarily comply with copyright laws, Xvideos has adopted a repeat infringer policy and notified its users of the policy's terms. A link to the repeat infringer policy is placed on the upload page of Xvideos.

This repeat infringer policy bans users from Xvideos if they continue to upload videos that are removed pursuant to takedown notices. When a user is banned, he or she may not continue to upload content or re-register.

### If you are a copyright owner, we provide a tool to prevent unauthorized uploads of your content.

Xvideos provides a free service to digitally fingerprint your videos and block future unauthorized attempts to upload them. If you are interested in the technical details of this process, you can read more about [digital video fingerprinting on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_fingerprinting).

Xvideos is proud to have been the first site in the adult industry to offer this service.

In order to take advantage of our fingerprinting service, you must provide a list of the videos you wish to have fingerprinted. Each line of the list should include a URL to a video file and a text description of the material for quick identification. In order for the fingerprinting technology to be most effective, the linked content has to be in high quality and in a standard format. We will not download and store your videos in the fingerprinting process. Our technology simply scans the videos on the link provided (on your servers) to generate thumbnails and signatures and prevent future upload attempts.

Once we have generated signatures for your videos, we will prevent uploads matching that signature. Note that this may not block all attempts to upload your video; sometimes the fingerprint will not match if the video has been very heavily modified.
