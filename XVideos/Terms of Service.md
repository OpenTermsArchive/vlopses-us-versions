Webprocessing does not permit copyright infringing activities or infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and will expeditiously remove infringing content in response to a valid takedown request. Repeat copyright infringers will have their user accounts and other access to the Website terminated.  Read about our repeat infringers policy here at https://info.xvideos.red/legal/repeat.

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or other content infringes upon your copyright, submit a copyright infringement takedown request available at the following link [https://info.xvideos.red/takedown](https://info.xvideos.red/takedown) with the above form containing the following information:

*   an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; AND
*   a description identifying the material claimed to have been infringed and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and the location where the original or an authorized copy of the material exists (for example, the URL of the page of the website where it is lawfully posted; the name, edition and pages of a book from which an excerpt was copied, etc.); AND
*   information reasonably sufficient to permit Webprocessing to contact you, such as a physical address, telephone number and email address; AND
*   a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material, in the manner complained of, is not authorized by its rightful owner, its agent, or the law; AND
*   a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rightful copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner’s behalf.

**You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your takedown request may not be valid or may be delayed in processing.**

Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your claim of an alleged copyright infringement and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, when submitting a takedown request, we are required to process your personal data and provide the uploader of the material at issue with the following personal data: your name, your contact information, as well as the contents of your takedown request. If you are an authorized representative submitting a report, we provide the name of the organization or client that owns the right in question. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the takedown request or counter-notification claimant and without it, we are unable to process your takedown request or counter-notification as prescribed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**DMCA**”). Where the party against whom you are making your takedown request resides outside the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit your personal data exclusively for the purpose of assessing the merits of your takedown request and will notify the recipient of the data of this limited purpose and the confidential and sensitive nature of your personal data. However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and we do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.

You consent to your data being transmitted to the uploader of the material at issue in line with and for the reasons explained above and in the Privacy Policy.

**Copyright Counter-Notification Process**

When an uploader’s video submission has been removed, the Website will notify the uploader of this removal. Pursuant to the Website’s policies and in accordance with the DMCA, the uploader has five (5) days to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown request was sent in error. The counter-notification may be sent to Webprocessing’s email address from which the user originally received the forwarded takedown request.

For the Website to consider a counter-notification, it must include the following:

*   a physical or electronic signature of the uploader; AND
*   identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available; AND
*   a statement under penalty of perjury that the uploader has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; AND
*   the uploader's name, address, and telephone number; AND
*   a statement that the uploader consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the user is located, or if the uploader’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Website may be found; AND
*   a statement that the uploader will accept service of process from the takedown request claimant or an agent of such person.

**Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be considered by the Website.**

Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your counter-notification related to the relevant takedown request and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, we will process your personal data and will provide the party who originally made the takedown request with your completed counter-notification, which will include the following personal data: your name, and contact information, as well as the content of your counter-notification. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the addressees of your takedown request and without it, we are unable to process your counter-notification as prescribed under the DMCA. Where takedown request claimant resides outside the EEA, you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit any personal data included in your counter-notification exclusively for the purpose of processing your counter-notification and will notify the recipient that any personal data included in your counter-notification is of confidential and sensitive nature. However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.

You consent to your personal data being transmitted to the takedown request claimant in line with and for the reasons explained above and in the Privacy Policy.

That person may elect to file a lawsuit against you for copyright infringement. If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will restore access to the removed materials. Until that time, your uploaded material will remain inaccessible. We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked.

For non-copyright related complaints, such as to report child sexual abuse material, non-consensual sexual acts, privacy, abuse, harassment, or other inappropriate or illegal content, please use the form at [https://info.xvideos.red/takedown-amateur](https://info.xvideos.red/takedown-amateur). All submitted complaints will be evaluated and resolved within five (5) business days. We do not accept that we are a joint controller of Third Party Personal Data available or contained in any forms submitted, or otherwise provided to us, by you and disclaim any and all liability in connection with the Third Party Personal Data.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN YOUR APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WEBPROCESSING SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR USER SUBMISSIONS OR ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.

HOWEVER, WEBPROCESSING IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT FORESEEABLE. LOSS OR DAMAGE IS FORESEEABLE ONLY IF IT WAS AN OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCE OF OUR BREACH OR IF IT WAS CONTEMPLATED BY YOU AND WEBPROCESSING AT THE TIME WE ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS.

Contact for other content-related issues, such as reporting inappropriate content can be made here at [https://info.xvideos.red/takedown-amateur](https://info.xvideos.red/takedown-amateur).

If you elect to send Webprocessing a Notice of Dispute pursuant to the provisions at Section 14 of these Terms of Service, the notice must be in writing, sent by registered mail and addressed to Webprocessing s.r.o. Address: Pujmanové 1753/10a, Nusle, 140 00 Praha 4, Czech Republic, Attn: Dispute Resolution, Subject: Notice of Dispute. Failure to follow this procedure could delay or prevent our review of your Notice.

#### **14\. Dispute Resolution, Agreement to Arbitrate, Class Action Waiver, Venue and Forum**

In this Section 14, you and Webprocessing may be referred to individually as “a party” or collectively as “the parties.”

The parties shall endeavor to resolve _any and all_ claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with your use of the Website or with the Terms of Service by engaging in amicable consultations for no less than thirty (30) calendar days. Before bringing a formal legal case, you must send a written notice of dispute (“**Notice of Dispute**”) via registered mail to “Webprocessing s.r.o. Address: Pujmanové 1753/10a, Nusle, 140 00 Praha 4, Czech Republic, Attn: Dispute Resolution, Subject: Notice of Dispute” to give Webprocessing the opportunity to resolve the dispute with you informally, as also indicated in Section 13 of these terms of Service.

The Notice of Dispute must contain sufficient information to identify you and the basis of your claim. Amicable consultations will commence upon Webprocessing’s receipt of a Notice of Dispute.

You and Webprocessing agree to negotiate the dispute in good faith for no less than 30 days after a valid Notice of Dispute is provided. If the dispute cannot be resolved by amicable consultations within 30 days after receipt of a Notice of Dispute, you agree that ANY and all existing and/or future controversy and/or claim between you and Webprocessing shall be resolved as follows:

**i. No Class Actions**

Neither you nor Webprocessing may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any claim or dispute. Claims or disputes may not be arbitrated or resolved on a class or representative basis.

**ii. You and Webprocessing Agree to Arbitrate**

You and Webprocessing agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating in any manner to, or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or Webprocessing’s Services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, through final and binding arbitration.

An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you and Webprocessing agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury.

This agreement applies to all claims except those identified in Section 14 (v). This agreement applies even after you stop using or choose to delete your xvideos.Red account.

**iii. The Arbitration Process**

The Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic (“**Arbitration Court**”) will conduct any arbitration between you and Webprocessing, except for disputes in which the Czech state courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Czech law. The parties agree that the Rules of the Arbitration Court are applicable and will govern. You may read the Rules of the Arbitration Court here at [https://en.soud.cz/rules](https://en.soud.cz/rules). (This webpage address is potentially subject to change as it is not under Webprocessing’s control.) If any Terms in these Terms of Service conflict with any Rules of the Arbitration Court, the parties agree to follow these Terms.

Disputes shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (“**Arbitrators**”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Court in effect at the time the notice of dispute was filed or received by Webprocessing. The resulting award shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The seat of the arbitration shall be Prague, Czech Republic; the proceedings shall take place in Prague, Czech Republic; and the language of arbitration shall be English.

The parties agree that any disputes concerning the enforceability, validity, or scope of the arbitration agreement in this Section 14 (or any portion of it) shall be resolved by the Arbitration Court of the Czech Republic, which will have sole authority to decide those issues.

The parties further agree not to pursue injunctive relief (i.e., an order that the other party do or not to do something, apart from paying damages) in arbitration. Such relief must be sought in court instead. If a party has a dispute for which they seek to obtain both injunctive and other forms of relief, the party must go to court to seek the injunctive relief and must arbitrate to seek the other forms of relief.

**iv. Arbitration Fees and Costs:**

If you start an arbitration in accordance with the Terms, you will be required to pay the Arbitration Court’s initial filing fees. You will not be responsible for paying any other fees of the Arbitrators, since all other fees and expenses charged by the Arbitrators will be paid by Webprocessing. Additionally, if the Arbitrators determine that you are unable to pay all or any part of the filing fee, Webprocessing will pay that too. Based on the ultimate outcome of the arbitration, the Arbitrators may decide in accordance with, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party or parties in the arbitration.

**v. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate**

You and Webprocessing further agree that the Czech District Courts in Prague, Czech Republic, will have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes:

1.  relating to your or Webprocessing’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); OR
    
2.  where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief, including where a party seeks other forms of relief but is bound, as per Section 14(ii), to seek those other forms of relief through arbitration; OR
    
3.  any other judicial proceedings which by law is not subject to arbitration.
    

In the event your local law prohibits arbitration, you may submit a motion for the extrajudicial handling of your dispute to the designated authority for extrajudicial handling of the consumer disputes, which is the Czech Trade Inspection Authority [https://www.coi.cz](https://www.coi.cz/). Disputes arising from contracts on service provision concluded online between a consumer with residency in the European Union and a trader established in the European Union can also be resolved using the online dispute resolution platform at [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr). Alternatively, and to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, you agree that the Czech general courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes in which at least one of the parties to the dispute is a consumer, unless mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country provide as a further alternative that a dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms of Service be handled by the court of the jurisdiction where you reside or are domiciled. If you are acting as an individual consumer and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence or domicile contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Czech law or of Czech courts.

Section 14 of these Terms of Service will survive the termination of your relationship with Webprocessing.

#### **15\. Governing Law**

You agree that the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, Webprocessing’s Services, and any claims or disputes arising out of, relating in any manner to, or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or Webprocessing’s Services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, except for the laws of the Czech Republic that govern conflict- or choice-of-law. The substantive law of the Czech Republic shall control, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

#### **16\. Separation of Terms**

Each of the paragraphs of these Terms of Service operates separately. If any part of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of any such provision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which still apply and are binding. Any unenforceable term will be substituted with a term that comes as close to the unlawful or unenforceable term as possible.

#### **17\. General**

These Terms of Service, the privacy policy, the rules as written on the upload form, and any other legal notices published on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Webprocessing. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such Term or any other Term, and Webprocessing’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.

We may amend, and reserve the right to amend, these Terms at any time and for any reason by posting updated Terms on our Website. We will notify you of major changes made to these Terms of Service, such as those relating to the characteristics of the service provided. You are advised to periodically review the most up-to-date version of our Terms of Service, so that you are aware of any changes. Once we make new Terms available, any changes become effective immediately and by using the Website, you agree to the Terms as amended. By continuing to use our Website and services after the changes take effect, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.

#### **18\. Other**

We hereby inform you of your right to withdraw from the contract for any reason, in order to do so, you must inform us in writing within 14 days from the conclusion of the contract. If you withdraw from the contract after Webprocessing start providing the services within abovementioned period, we may request payment of the services you have already used. The minimum period of service is for 1 month. The contract is concluded for an indefinite time period, you may terminate the contract at any time for any reason by canceling your subscription. You have a right to submit a warranty claim to Webprocessing and Webprocessing is obliged to accept this claim and process it. The claim must be submitted to Webprocessing without undue delay, no later than within two months from the date of the defective provision of the Service. Webprocessing is obliged to deal with the claim without undue delay within one month from submission of the claim. If Webprocessing finds the claim justified and the defect can be fixed, a consumer may demand either a repair or supplementing what is missing, or a reasonable price reduction. If a defect cannot be fixed and prevents the proper use of the Service, the consumer may either withdraw from the contract or demand a reasonable price reduction.

### XVIDEOS ACCOUNT TYPES

Your XVIDEOS account can have several status :

**Regular** : basic free account.  
**Verified** : indicates that you have passed the **[verification process](https://www.xvideos.com/account/verify-profile)** by making a video that shows that you are a real xvideos viewer.  
**Model** : model accounts can be amateurs, porn stars, webcam models, and erotic models. They indicate that **you** are the main content for your own account. **[Apply here.](https://www.xvideos.com/account/request-account-status/model)**  
**Channel** : this status is only given after verifying ownership of the content uploaded to your account, usually with a video verification (if you appear in your videos), or through other means (if you are a studio/producer). **[Apply here.](https://www.xvideos.com/account/request-account-status/channel)**

These status can also be grouped together sometimes. For example you can be channel+model

### OPTIMAL STATUS FOR YOUR NEEDS

If you are a regular user trying to make connections on the site the best status is : **verified**

If you are a model looking to build your brand or to make money, you first have to verify. After that you should aim to obtain these 2 status : **model** and **channel**. We may offer you the upgrades directly after verification but If we don't, feel free to apply.

If you are a content owner / producer you will need to obtain this status or you will struggle to get views : **channel**.

They are the best setups to use XVIDEOS but you may also have good results with others. However they will always be inferior (in views / activity / performance / interest / ease of use, etc). The table below demonstrates why :

Webprocessing does not permit copyright infringing activities or infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and will expeditiously remove infringing content in response to a valid takedown request. Repeat copyright infringers will have their user accounts and other access to the Website terminated.  Read about our repeat infringers policy here at https://info.xvideos.red/legal/repeat.

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or other content infringes upon your copyright, submit a copyright infringement takedown request available at the following link [https://info.xvideos.red/takedown](https://info.xvideos.red/takedown) with the above form containing the following information:

*   an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; AND
*   a description identifying the material claimed to have been infringed and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and the location where the original or an authorized copy of the material exists (for example, the URL of the page of the website where it is lawfully posted; the name, edition and pages of a book from which an excerpt was copied, etc.); AND
*   information reasonably sufficient to permit Webprocessing to contact you, such as a physical address, telephone number and email address; AND
*   a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material, in the manner complained of, is not authorized by its rightful owner, its agent, or the law; AND
*   a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rightful copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner’s behalf.

**You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your takedown request may not be valid or may be delayed in processing.**

Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your claim of an alleged copyright infringement and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, when submitting a takedown request, we are required to process your personal data and provide the uploader of the material at issue with the following personal data: your name, your contact information, as well as the contents of your takedown request. If you are an authorized representative submitting a report, we provide the name of the organization or client that owns the right in question. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the takedown request or counter-notification claimant and without it, we are unable to process your takedown request or counter-notification as prescribed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**DMCA**”). Where the party against whom you are making your takedown request resides outside the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit your personal data exclusively for the purpose of assessing the merits of your takedown request and will notify the recipient of the data of this limited purpose and the confidential and sensitive nature of your personal data. However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and we do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.

You consent to your data being transmitted to the uploader of the material at issue in line with and for the reasons explained above and in the Privacy Policy.

**Copyright Counter-Notification Process**

When an uploader’s video submission has been removed, the Website will notify the uploader of this removal. Pursuant to the Website’s policies and in accordance with the DMCA, the uploader has five (5) days to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown request was sent in error. The counter-notification may be sent to Webprocessing’s email address from which the user originally received the forwarded takedown request.

For the Website to consider a counter-notification, it must include the following:

*   a physical or electronic signature of the uploader; AND
*   identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available; AND
*   a statement under penalty of perjury that the uploader has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; AND
*   the uploader's name, address, and telephone number; AND
*   a statement that the uploader consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the user is located, or if the uploader’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Website may be found; AND
*   a statement that the uploader will accept service of process from the takedown request claimant or an agent of such person.

**Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be considered by the Website.**

Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your counter-notification related to the relevant takedown request and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, we will process your personal data and will provide the party who originally made the takedown request with your completed counter-notification, which will include the following personal data: your name, and contact information, as well as the content of your counter-notification. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the addressees of your takedown request and without it, we are unable to process your counter-notification as prescribed under the DMCA. Where takedown request claimant resides outside the EEA, you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit any personal data included in your counter-notification exclusively for the purpose of processing your counter-notification and will notify the recipient that any personal data included in your counter-notification is of confidential and sensitive nature. However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.

You consent to your personal data being transmitted to the takedown request claimant in line with and for the reasons explained above and in the Privacy Policy.

That person may elect to file a lawsuit against you for copyright infringement. If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will restore access to the removed materials. Until that time, your uploaded material will remain inaccessible. We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked.

For non-copyright related complaints, such as to report child sexual abuse material, non-consensual sexual acts, privacy, abuse, harassment, or other inappropriate or illegal content, please use the form at [https://info.xvideos.red/takedown-amateur](https://info.xvideos.red/takedown-amateur). All submitted complaints will be evaluated and resolved within five (5) business days. We do not accept that we are a joint controller of Third Party Personal Data available or contained in any forms submitted, or otherwise provided to us, by you and disclaim any and all liability in connection with the Third Party Personal Data.

Such fraudulent reporting to avoid payment for goods or services that you or anyone under your authority has made to us when you have an outstanding charge to us shall make you liable to Webprocessing for in liquidated damages. This liability for liquidated damages is in addition to any other liability you may incur for breaches of any other provision of these Terms of Service.

If you believe that you have been erroneously billed, please notify us immediately of such error. If we do not hear from you within 30 days after such billing error first appears on any account statement, such fee will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes, including resolution of inquiries made by your credit card issuer.

We do not provide cash refunds. We do, however, grant credits in the form of free monthly memberships to resolve customer service issues. The billing system used by Webprocessing or our authorized agents provides extensive credit card fraud protection measures and the Website includes many features to protect users from accidental charges. Therefore, refunds to your credit card will be provided only under the rarest of circumstances, such as persistent technical problems originating with our equipment.

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

SOME STATES OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION/EXCLUSIONS OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH MEANS THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IF YOU RESIDE IN ONE OF THOSE STATES OR COUNTRIES. FOR THOSE USERS, IF WEBPROCESSING FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, WEBPROCESSING IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE YOU SUFFER THAT IS A FORESEEABLE RESULT OF WEBPROCESSING’S BREACH OF THESE TERMS OR IS A RESULT OF WEBPROCESSING’S NEGLIGENCE. HOWEVER, WEBPROCESSING IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT FORESEEABLE. LOSS OR DAMAGE IS FORESEEABLE ONLY IF IT WAS AN OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCE OF OUR BREACH OR IF IT WAS CONTEMPLATED BY YOU AND WEBPROCESSING AT THE TIME WE ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS.

Address: Pujmanové 1753/10a, Nusle, 140 00 Praha 4, Czech Republic, Attn: Dispute Resolution, Subject: Notice of Dispute. Failure to follow this procedure could delay or prevent our review of your Notice.

#### **14\. Dispute Resolution, Agreement to Arbitrate, Class Action Waiver, Venue and Forum**

In this Section 14, you and Webprocessing may be referred to individually as “a party” or collectively as “the parties.”

The parties shall endeavor to resolve _any and all_ claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with your use of the Website or with the Terms of Service by engaging in amicable consultations for no less than thirty (30) calendar days. Before bringing a formal legal case, you must send a written notice of dispute (“**Notice of Dispute**”) via registered mail to “Webprocessing s.r.o. Address: Pujmanové 1753/10a, Nusle, 140 00 Praha 4, Czech Republic, Attn: Dispute Resolution, Subject: Notice of Dispute” to give Webprocessing the opportunity to resolve the dispute with you informally, as also indicated in Section 13 of these terms of Service.

The Notice of Dispute must contain sufficient information to identify you and the basis of your claim. Amicable consultations will commence upon Webprocessing’s receipt of a Notice of Dispute.

You and Webprocessing agree to negotiate the dispute in good faith for no less than 30 days after a valid Notice of Dispute is provided. If the dispute cannot be resolved by amicable consultations within 30 days after receipt of a Notice of Dispute, you agree that ANY and all existing and/or future controversy and/or claim between you and Webprocessing shall be resolved as follows:

**i. No Class Actions**

Neither you nor Webprocessing may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any claim or dispute. Claims or disputes may not be arbitrated or resolved on a class or representative basis.

**ii. You and Webprocessing Agree to Arbitrate**

You and Webprocessing agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating in any manner to, or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or Webprocessing’s Services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, through final and binding arbitration.

An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you and Webprocessing agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury.

This agreement applies to all claims except those identified in Section 14 (v). This agreement applies even after you stop using or choose to delete your xvideos.Red account.

**iii. The Arbitration Process**

The Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic (“**Arbitration Court**”) will conduct any arbitration between you and Webprocessing, except for disputes in which the Czech state courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Czech law. The parties agree that the Rules of the Arbitration Court are applicable and will govern. You may read the Rules of the Arbitration Court here at [https://en.soud.cz/rules](https://en.soud.cz/rules). (This webpage address is potentially subject to change as it is not under Webprocessing’s control.) If any Terms in these Terms of Service conflict with any Rules of the Arbitration Court, the parties agree to follow these Terms.

Disputes shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (“**Arbitrators**”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Court in effect at the time the notice of dispute was filed or received by Webprocessing. The resulting award shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The seat of the arbitration shall be Prague, Czech Republic; the proceedings shall take place in Prague, Czech Republic; and the language of arbitration shall be English.

The parties agree that any disputes concerning the enforceability, validity, or scope of the arbitration agreement in this Section 14 (or any portion of it) shall be resolved by the Arbitration Court of the Czech Republic, which will have sole authority to decide those issues.

The parties further agree not to pursue injunctive relief (i.e., an order that the other party do or not to do something, apart from paying damages) in arbitration. Such relief must be sought in court instead. If a party has a dispute for which they seek to obtain both injunctive and other forms of relief, the party must go to court to seek the injunctive relief and must arbitrate to seek the other forms of relief.

**iv. Arbitration Fees and Costs:**

If you start an arbitration in accordance with the Terms, you will be required to pay the Arbitration Court’s initial filing fees. You will not be responsible for paying any other fees of the Arbitrators, since all other fees and expenses charged by the Arbitrators will be paid by Webprocessing. Additionally, if the Arbitrators determine that you are unable to pay all or any part of the filing fee, Webprocessing will pay that too. Based on the ultimate outcome of the arbitration, the Arbitrators may decide in accordance with, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party or parties in the arbitration.

**v. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate**

You and Webprocessing further agree that the Czech District Courts in Prague, Czech Republic, will have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes:

1.  relating to your or Webprocessing’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); OR
    
2.  where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief, including where a party seeks other forms of relief but is bound, as per Section 14(ii), to seek those other forms of relief through arbitration; OR
    
3.  any other judicial proceedings which by law is not subject to arbitration.
    

In the event your local law prohibits arbitration, you may submit a motion for the extrajudicial handling of your dispute to the designated authority for extrajudicial handling of the consumer disputes, which is the Czech Trade Inspection Authority [https://www.coi.cz](https://www.coi.cz/). Disputes arising from contracts on service provision concluded online between a consumer with residency in the European Union and a trader established in the European Union can also be resolved using the online dispute resolution platform at [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr). Alternatively, and to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, you agree that the Czech general courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes in which at least one of the parties to the dispute is a consumer, unless mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country provide as a further alternative that a dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms of Service be handled by the court of the jurisdiction where you reside or are domiciled. If you are acting as an individual consumer and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence or domicile contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Czech law or of Czech courts.

Section 14 of these Terms of Service will survive the termination of your relationship with Webprocessing.

#### **15\. Governing Law**

You agree that the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, Webprocessing’s Services, and any claims or disputes arising out of, relating in any manner to, or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or Webprocessing’s Services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, except for the laws of the Czech Republic that govern conflict- or choice-of-law. The substantive law of the Czech Republic shall control, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

#### **16\. Separation of Terms**

Each of the paragraphs of these Terms of Service operates separately. If any part of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of any such provision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which still apply and are binding. Any unenforceable term will be substituted with a term that comes as close to the unlawful or unenforceable term as possible.

#### **17\. General**

These Terms of Service, the privacy policy, the rules as written on the upload form, and any other legal notices published on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Webprocessing. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such Term or any other Term, and Webprocessing’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.

We may amend, and reserve the right to amend, these Terms at any time and for any reason by posting updated Terms on our Website. We will notify you of major changes made to these Terms of Service, such as those relating to the characteristics of the service provided.
