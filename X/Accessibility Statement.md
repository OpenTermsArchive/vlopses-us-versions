Community created content

One of the best parts of X is being able to create and share content, especially media like images and videos. While not all content creators are willing or able to provide content in an inclusive way, we are continuously working to encourage content creators to share accessible content by educating and providing tools to simplify adding meaningful text alternatives and descriptions.
