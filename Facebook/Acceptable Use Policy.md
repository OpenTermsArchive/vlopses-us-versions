Meta Pay Acceptable Use Policy
==============================

UPDATED AUG 29, 2022

Businesses who wish to incorporate Meta Pay functionality into their own, or other businesses’, websites or checkout experiences must comply with the Meta Pay Acceptable Use Policy. This policy governs which transactions Meta has determined are unacceptable to complete using Meta Pay functionality.

Businesses are independently responsible for complying with all applicable laws in all actions related to use of Meta’s services, regardless of the purpose of the use.

Failure to comply with the Meta Pay Acceptable Use Policy may result in a variety of consequences, including, but not limited to, suspension, termination, or disablement of access to Meta Pay or other Meta , Instagram, or WhatsApp products or features. If you repeatedly violate our policies, we may take additional action. Meta reserves the right to reject or approve any transaction for any reason at any time, in our sole discretion. Meta also reserves the right at any time to disable Meta Pay transactions on your websites for any reason we deem prudent.
