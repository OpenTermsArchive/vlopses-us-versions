Corporate Human Rights Policy



Meta’s mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We build social technologies

to enable the best of what people can do together. Our principles are: give people a voice; serve everyone; promote economic

opportunity; build connection and community; keep people safe and protect privacy. We recognize all people are equal in dignity

and rights. We are all equally entitled to our human rights, without discrimination. Human rights are interrelated,

interdependent and indivisible.



OUR COMMITMENTS We are committed to respecting human rights as set out in the United Nations

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). This commitment encompasses

internationally recognized human rights as defined by the International Bill of Human Rights

— which consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant

on Civil and Political Rights; and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and

Cultural Rights — as well as the International Labour Organization Declaration on

Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.



Depending on circumstances, we also utilize other widely accepted international human

rights instruments, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms

of Racial Discrimination; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination

Against Women; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the Convention on the Rights

of Persons with Disabilities; the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; and

the American Convention on Human Rights.



We specifically recognize that the universal obligation of non-discrimination is a necessary

― but not sufficient ― condition for real, lived, equality.



We are committed to implementing the Global Network Initiative (GNI) Principles on

Freedom of Expression and Privacy, and their associated Implementation Guidelines.



Human rights also guide our work developing responsible innovation practices,

including when building, testing, and deploying products and services enabled by

Artificial Intelligence (AI).



We recognize the importance of the OECD Principles on Artificial Intelligence, which

are widely adopted and endorsed by the G20. In particular, we note the framework’s

recommendation that:



"AI actors should respect the rule of law, human rights and democratic values,

throughout the AI system lifecycle. These include freedom, dignity and autonomy,

privacy and data protection, non-discrimination and equality, diversity, fairness,

social justice, and internationally recognised labour rights.”



We recognize the diversity of laws in the locations where we operate, and where people use

our products. We strive to respect domestic laws. When faced with conflicts between such

laws and our human rights commitments, we seek to honor the principles of internationally

recognized human rights to the greatest extent possible. In these circumstances we seek to

promote international human rights standards by engaging with governments, and by

collaborating with other stakeholders and companies.



HOW WE IMPLEMENT We implement our commitment to human rights using approaches set out in the United

Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). These approaches

include (1) applying human rights policies; (2) conducting human rights due diligence and

disclosure; (3) providing access to remedy; (4) maintaining oversight, governance, and

accountability; and (5) protecting human rights defenders; The potential human rights

impact of Meta’s family of apps varies significantly across time, location, content, and

affected communities. For this reason, we identify and prioritize the most salient human

rights issues in each context using the UNGP’s framework of severity (scope, scale,

remediability) and likelihood.



01

Applying Relevant

Policies



Our respect for human rights - and their underlying principles of equality, safety, dignity,

privacy, and voice - is applied through:



● Our Community Standards, which outline what user-generated content is and is not

allowed on Facebook. We look to international human rights experts when

developing these standards, among other stakeholders, and when deciding how to

implement them in practice. We seek to meaningfully engage with potentially

affected groups and other stakeholders through our Stakeholder Engagement

program.

● Our membership in the Global Network Initiative (GNI), whose Principles and

Implementation Guidelines are based on international human rights standards. Our

compliance with our GNI commitments is independently assessed every two years.

● Our Responsible Supply Chain program, which defines and implements our

expectations of our suppliers, contractors and vendors based on key international

human rights standards. Our program standards include: the Responsible Business

Alliance Code of Conduct; our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement; and

our Conflict Minerals Policy.

● Our Privacy Principles, and comprehensive privacy program. Through the Privacy

Review process for new products or updates, we look closely at how we use data,

assess risks, and put safeguards in place to address them. We are also members of

the multi-stakeholder Reform Government Surveillance initiative, which advocates

for government data requests to be rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent,

subject to strong oversight and protective of end-to-end encryption.

● Our Law Enforcement Guidelines and our Data Policy. These measures safeguard

the data of billions of users from arbitrary or overbroad requests. In addition, we

assess, under our policies, whether requests are consistent with internationally

recognized standards on human rights, including due process, privacy, free

expression and the rule of law. For example, if we determine that a government

request is deficient, we push back and engage governments to address any

apparent deficiencies. Where appropriate, we will legally challenge deficient

requests.

● Our Transparency Reporting, published regularly, which gives visibility into how we

enforce our Community Standards and Community Guidelines, respond to

government requests, and protect intellectual property;

● Our Responsible Innovation Dimensions, which product teams use early in the

product development process to anticipate and mitigate potential harms to

individuals, communities, and society that could be caused by our products, and

were developed to be consistent with human rights principles;

● Our Responsible AI efforts, through which we have established a multi-disciplinary

team of ethicists, social and political scientists, policy and rights experts,

researchers, and engineers, which focuses on understanding fairness and inclusion

concerns associated with the deployment of AI in our products;

● Our Diversity and Inclusion practices. We commit to strong diversity and inclusion

practices in our workplace as one important driver of equality in our workplace, and

as a vital input for the development of products and policies that bring equal value

to all people;

● On Instagram, our content policies are outlined in our Community Guidelines.

We safeguard data through our Instagram Data Policy. We also have an

Equity Product Team focused on algorithmic fairness and equitable product

experiences; and

● Our private messaging service WhatsApp is committed to privacy as an enabling

right, which underpins freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the

safeguarding of human dignity. By upholding the privacy and security of people’s

messages via end-to-end encryption, so that only the people who are

communicating with each other ―and nobody inbetween, not even WhatsApp --

can read or listen to what is sent, we help protect the most vulnerable groups from

surveillance and abuse. We empower users to control their own privacy, and to keep

themselves and their communications safe and secure.



We are also building greater awareness of equality and non-discrimination concepts,

and how they apply to our products and policies. This work is being done by expanding

our knowledge and driving action through our Civil Rights Task Force, Civil Rights Vice

President, commitments to civil rights training, onboarding civil rights expertise, and further

development of internal civil rights accountability processes.



02

Conducting Human

Rights Due Diligence and

Disclosure



The potential human rights impacts of Meta’s products and operations varies significantly

across time, location, content, and affected communities. We thus identify and prioritize the

most salient human rights issues in each context using the UNGP framework of likelihood

and severity (the latter defined by scope, scale, and remediability).



We conduct human rights due diligence to identify such risks,and to help us create

strategies to avoid, prevent and mitigate them. We also seek to identify and support

opportunities for our products, policies, and operations to promote human rights.



We use a variety of due diligence methodologies, including, but not limited to, human rights

impact assessments.



We pay particular attention to the rights and needs of users from groups or populations

that may be at heightened risk of becoming vulnerable or marginalized. We are committed

to identifying relevant such groups for each context, undertaking meaningful engagement

to hear their hopes and concerns, and to protecting and promoting their rights when using

our products.



When conducting anti-slavery and human trafficking due diligence, which is part of our

responsible supply chain program, we verify supplier conformance with our standards

through dialogue, independent audits and assessments, worker surveys, and other forms of

assurance. Any nonconformances identified are actively addressed through our corrective

action and key performance indicator programs. We are committed to engaging

meaningfully and proactively with our supply chain partners, building supplier capacity, and

responding quickly to challenges as they arise.



We believe it is important to communicate about our human rights work. We’ll report

annually on how we’re addressing human rights impacts, including relevant insights arising

from human rights due diligence, and the actions we are taking in response. We may also

occasionally choose to publish a specific, individual piece of due diligence if we believe doing

so meaningfully advances the human rights field.



Our human rights due diligence goes beyond what is captured in these disclosures.

For example, human rights are essential to other areas of Meta’s business. These include,

but are not limited to: our efforts to help prevent election interference; assess and improve

our content review operations; ensure platform integrity; foster responsible innovation;

implement and uphold privacy principles; assess how we respond to government

data disclosure requests; uphold the highest supply chain standards; and understand

our social impact.



03

Providing Remedies for

Human Rights Impacts



Where a company has caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts, the UNGPs

state the company should provide for or cooperate to remedy these impacts.



Meta’s Code of Conduct sets out guidelines for business conduct required of all Meta

Personnel, and is accompanied by multiple channels to report concerns or violations, and

potential remedies. The ability to make anonymous reports is covered by Meta’s

Whistleblower and Complaint Policy. Retaliation or intimidation against individuals reporting

issues in good faith is strictly forbidden. Further details are available in the Code of Conduct

or in the Whistleblower and Complaint Policy.



We give people the option to appeal a broad range of content-moderation decisions, absent

pressing safety concerns. Upon further review, we may restore content that was incorrectly

removed, and remove content that was incorrectly left up. We share related data regularly in

our public transparency reporting in the Community Standards Enforcement Report. We are

seeking to further enhance transparency around these complex issues of unprecedented

speed and scale.



Further, the Oversight Board has a mandate to protect freedom of expression and other

human rights by making independent decisions about emblematic pieces of content it

selects from among those submitted to it for appeal, and by issuing advisory opinions on

Meta’s content policies. By providing a new mechanism for independent review of certain

content decisions, the Oversight Board is intended to increase access to remedy for

Facebook and Instagram users, and other relevant rights holders. When designing the

Oversight Board, we reviewed its proposed charter, bylaws, and operations against the

effectiveness criteria for operational grievance mechanisms and access to remedy set

out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We believe the Oversight

Board breaks new ground for access to remedy in the social media industry, and hope it

serves as a useful model for other companies and initiatives.



04

Protecting Human Rights

Defenders



We seek to protect human rights defenders, as defined by the UN Declaration on Human

Rights Defenders, in their work to peacefully promote and protect human rights.



The term “human rights defenders” includes human rights organizations; members

of vulnerable groups advocating for their rights; professional and citizen journalists;

non-violent political activists; and any member of the public who raises a human

rights concern.



At Meta, we recognize human rights defenders are a high-risk user group. We strive to

offer specific measures to protect their safety and well-being. On social media, these risks

can include digital security risks; online attacks against individuals or groups; surveillance;

and censorship demands from governments or their proxies. More importantly, these online

risks may have the potential to lead to offline harms, including violence, arrest, and

termination of employment.



We proactively engage with human rights defenders to understand their needs and the

heightened human rights risks they face. We strive to offer specific measures to protect

their safety and mitigate such risks.



We condemn all threats, acts of intimidation and retaliation, persecution, and physical and

legal attacks against human rights defenders. We strive to support their important work, and

particularly the foundational rights of freedom of expression, assembly, and political

participation, as defined by internationally recognized human rights standards. We do not

provide governments with direct access or “back doors” to people’s information, and we

would challenge any order that sought to have us redesign our systems to undermine the

encryption we provide to protect people’s data.



05

Governance, Oversight,

and Accountability



As a global social media and product company, Meta is connected to, and impacts, myriad

human rights issues.



We endeavor to promote a climate of respect and awareness for human rights throughout

our business. Our code of conduct sets out guidelines required of all Meta personnel.



Meta’s Human Rights Director is part of the company’s global policy division. The Director,

along with a dedicated team, advises on key product, policy, and corporate decisions; leads

human rights due diligence efforts. S/he works closely with legal, operations, policy, and

product leadership and staff to ensure we live up to the expectations of the UNGPs, as well

as our commitments as a member of the Global Network Initiative.



We ensure salient human rights issues are directed to the most relevant Meta decision

making forum, including the content policy team (e.g. the Policy Forum), and the privacy

team (e.g. the Privacy Cross-Functional Working Group). Our teams working on community

operations, law enforcement and security, responsible innovation, product integrity and

public policy — among others — also regularly identify, prevent, or mitigate salient human

rights risks.



Significant and challenging matters are regularly escalated to the Vice President for Global

Affairs and Communications and the Vice President and General Counsel, and may include

further input from Meta’s Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Diversity Officer, and the Chief

Executive Officer.



The Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications and the Vice President and

General Counsel shall oversee the implementation of this policy. Salient human rights

issues shall be reported periodically to the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof),

as appropriate.



This policy is founded on meaningful engagement with rights holders and other

stakeholders. These include civil society organizations, governments, and academics; as well

as the UN, its special procedures, and other international entities. This engagement informs

our community standards and other issue-specific policies; improves our human rights due

diligence; and enables better access to remedy.



This policy will be reviewed regularly to ensure it is updated.
