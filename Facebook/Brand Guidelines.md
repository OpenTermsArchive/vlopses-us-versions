Our Logo Evolution
------------------

  

Our logo has evolved over time, building on our past heritage, using an 'f' within a blue circle. The current logo has been refined in shape and color to make it more accessible and legible. Always ensure you are using the current version of our logo in any new designs or communications.

#### Primary logo color

Our primary expression of the logo is in Facebook Blue with a white ‘f’.

A Facebook Blue logo on a white background is our primary logo use.

A Facebook Blue logo may also be used over imagery placed with consideration of the image content and contrast. The ‘f’ is always white in this case, never transparent.

A white logo may also be used over imagery, but should be placed with consideration of the image content and contrast.

Logo usage
----------

  
  

We have a series of rules of how to apply our logo to ensure consistency.

Clear space is defined by taking the width of our logo and dividing it by four. So, if X represents the width of the logo, the clear space would be 1/4 X. This space applies to all applications.

The minimum logo size for digital applications is 16px wide. In print, the minimum size is 6mm wide.

  
  
  
  

#### In use examples

Below are some examples of where our logo is used in the correct way. Always ensure you give clear space around the logo and never place it too close to other logos or text. The logo should always be at least half a logo distance away from any other content.
