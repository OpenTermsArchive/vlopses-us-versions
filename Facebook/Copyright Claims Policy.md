Intellectual property




===========================

Copy link

Facebook is committed to helping people and organisations protect their intellectual property rights. The Facebook [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) do not allow posting content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.

Copyright
---------

Copyright is a legal right that seeks to protect original works of authorship (e.g. books, music, film, art). Generally, copyright protects original expression such as words or images. It does not protect facts and ideas, although it may protect the original words or images used to describe an idea. Copyright also doesn't protect things such as names, titles and slogans; however, another legal right called a [trademark](https://www.facebook.com/help/507663689427413?helpref=about_content) might protect those. Learn more about [reporting copyright violations](https://www.facebook.com/help/1020633957973118?helpref=about_content).

Trademark
---------

A trademark is a word, slogan, symbol or design (e.g. brand name, logo) that distinguishes the products or services offered by one person, group or company from another. Generally, trademark law seeks to prevent confusion among consumers about who provides or is affiliated with a product or service.

Trademark
=========

These articles provide information about trademarks. This includes what trademarks do and don't protect, how you can avoid infringing the trademarks of other people when posting to Facebook and how Facebook addresses reports of trademark infringement.

If you believe that someone is infringing your trademark, you can report it to us by [filling in this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/ipreporting/report/trademark). You can also apply to use [Brand Rights Protection](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/828925381043253), a tool that allows brands to identify and report content that misuses their intellectual property.

Please note that laws in different countries may vary. For more information on trademark law, you can visit the website of the [United States Patent and Trademark Office](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uspto.gov%2F) or the [World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wipo.int%2Fportal%2Fen%2Findex.html). Facebook can't provide you with legal advice, so you may want to speak with an attorney if you have more questions about trademarks.

What are trademarks and what they protect
=========================================

A trademark is a word, slogan, symbol or design (e.g. a brand name or logo) that a person or company uses to distinguish their products or services from those offered by others. A trademark is protectable when it's used in a distinctive way to identify a product or service. Whether you know it or not, you see trademarks all day long, whether shopping in stores or online, watching commercials on TV and so on.

Generally, trademark law seeks to prevent consumers from being confused about who provides, endorses or is affiliated with a particular product or service. To prevent this situation, a trademark owner may be able to stop others from using their trademark (or a similar trademark) without permission if that use may cause confusion.

Not all terms are eligible for trademark protection under the law. Protection depends on a variety of factors, including how unique, generic or descriptive the trademark is and how it's used. For example, the term "banana" may be protectable as a trademark to identify an electronics company, but perhaps not to describe a banana farm.

Please note, Facebook can't adjudicate disputes between third parties, and so we wouldn't be in a position to act on trademark reports that require an in-depth trademark analysis. This is also the case for trademark reports that appear to involve a real-world dispute that wouldn't be resolved by any action that Facebook could take. For example, if a trademark owner uses a trademark to refer to their restaurant that is exclusively located in one country, they generally won't be able to prevent another person from using the same term to refer to their own unrelated restaurant in a different country.

In these situations, rather than contacting Facebook, you may want to contact the party that you believe is infringing your rights directly, or seek any resolution in court or by other judicial means. Learn more about how to [report content on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/191999230901156?helpref=faq_content) that you believe infringes your trademark.

What is trademark infringement?
===============================

Generally, trademark infringement occurs when all three of the following requirements are met:

1.  A company or person uses a trademark owner's trademark (or similar trademark) without permission
2.  That use is in commerce, meaning that it's done in connection with the sale or promotion of goods or services
3.  That use is likely to confuse consumers about the source, endorsement or affiliation of the goods or services

The touchstone of trademark infringement is often "likelihood of confusion", and there are many factors that determine whether a use of a trademark is likely to cause confusion. For example, when a person's trademark is also used by someone else, but on unrelated goods or services, that use may not be infringement because it may not cause confusion. Which party used the trademark first can often be an important consideration as well.

There are also many limits to trademark rights that can preclude a trademark infringement claim. These include, amongst other things, geographic limitations, as well as the ability for someone to use your trademark to lawfully comment on or criticise your goods or services.

Please note that the law in different countries relating to trademark rights and trademark infringement can vary. If you're not sure whether a particular use of a trademark would be considered infringement, you may want to seek legal advice.

Trademark dilution
------------------

Trademark dilution may also be unlawful in certain countries. Dilution, which applies to famous trademarks, may occur in certain circumstances when a trademark is used without permission in commerce. Examples of dilution can include blurring (using the mark for unrelated goods or services in a way that weakens the distinctiveness of the mark) or tarnishment (using the mark in an unflattering or offensive way).

Does a trademark need to be registered to be protected?
=======================================================

In the US, a trademark can be registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Federal registrations with the USPTO establish trademark rights as of a certain date and provide a presumption that the registrant owns a valid trademark, amongst other things. For these reasons, trademark owners often obtain USPTO registrations.

Many other countries outside the US have adopted similar systems, including the ability for trademark owners to register their trademarks. For example, in the European Union, a trademark can be registered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) or with the national intellectual property offices within the Member States.

Both in the US and in some other countries, depending on the relevant laws, a trademark owner may still have certain rights even without a registration. Typically, a trademark owner's rights without a registration (often known as common law rights) may be weaker than rights that are subject to a registration. Also, it's important to bear in mind that registering a company with a government office or getting a permit to do business in a specific country or state (for example, a business registration) usually doesn't create a trademark right.

What is the difference between a trademark registration and a business registration?
====================================================================================

In some states in the US and in some countries outside the US, a company might be able to register with a government office, or obtain a permit or licence to do business in that country or state. These registrations, such as ones issued by a state's Secretary of State, generally aren't the same as a trademark registration and may not create trademark rights for the company.

In the US, a [trademark](https://www.facebook.com/help/1378807958858854?helpref=faq_content) can be registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In the European Union, a trademark can be registered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) or with the national intellectual property offices within the Member States.

How long does trademark protection last?
========================================

Trademark rights may last indefinitely, but only if the trademark owner continues to use the trademark in commerce to identify their products or services. If a trademark owner stops using the trademark, or if it isn't used properly, they might lose their trademark rights.

For trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), registrations must be renewed periodically. For trademarks that are registered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), registration lasts for ten years and may be renewed indefinitely. The laws in other jurisdictions may vary.

What is a counterfeit?
======================

A counterfeit good is a knock-off or replica version of another company's product. It usually copies the trademark (name or logo) and/or distinctive features of that other company's product to imitate a genuine product. The manufacture, promotion or sale of counterfeit goods is a type of trademark infringement that is illegal in most countries, and is recognised as being harmful to consumers, trademark owners and honest sellers. Please note that counterfeit goods may be unlawful even if the seller explicitly says that the goods are counterfeit, or otherwise disclaims authenticity of the goods.

If you believe that content on Facebook is selling or promoting counterfeit goods, you can report it by [filling in this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/ipreporting/report/counterfeit).

Are there any limits to trademark rights?
=========================================

Not all uses of a trademark without permission from the rights owner are necessarily an infringement of that trademark. The use of a trademark is only infringing if it's likely to confuse people regarding the source, endorsement or affiliation of products or services. So, if a trademark is used in a way that is unlikely to cause consumer confusion, that use is generally not considered infringing.

Simply referring to a trademark for the purpose of discussing the product or service offered probably won't be an infringing use of the trademark, as long as that reference doesn't use more of the trademark than is needed to make its point. In fact, you might need to use the trademark to describe or comment on a particular product or service. This is known as the doctrine of nominative fair use, and typically permits such uses as commentary, criticism, parody, reviews and, in some countries, comparative advertising.

And while these matters are very fact-specific, often trademark rights also don't prevent:

*   The resale of legitimate goods or selling legitimate goods through channels that are not authorised by the trademark owner
*   The use of a trademarked word in its ordinary dictionary meaning
*   The use of a trademark in a way that is not related to the sale or promotion of products or services

Trademark rights are generally limited to the geographic territory where the trademark owner uses the trademark to identify their goods or services. For example, if a trademark owner uses a trademark to refer to their restaurant in Country A, they likely won't be able to prevent another person from using the same term to refer to their own restaurant in Country B.

What's the difference between copyright and trademark?
======================================================

The law in most countries recognises copyrights as well as trademarks. Copyright law and trademark law serve two different purposes.

[Copyright](https://www.facebook.com/help/116772962146447?helpref=faq_content) is meant to foster creativity and to provide incentives to create original works of authorship for the benefit of the public. Copyright protects original works such as photos, videos, films and music. It's also important to note that, in the US, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) applies only to copyrights and doesn't apply to trademarks.

[Trademark](https://www.facebook.com/help/1378807958858854?helpref=faq_content) law is meant to prevent consumer harm because it prohibits someone other than the rights owner from using a trademark (e.g. a brand's logo) in a way that may confuse consumers. Trademark law protects brand names, slogans, logos or other symbols that help consumers identify the source of goods or services.

How can I make sure that the content I post to Facebook doesn't violate trademark law?
======================================================================================

Under Facebook's [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms) and [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F), you can only post content to Facebook if it doesn't violate someone else's intellectual property rights, including trademarks. Please note that as a Facebook user, you are responsible for the content you post. If your content violates Facebook's policies or is reported to Meta as infringing the intellectual property rights of another party, Facebook may remove that content.

Before you post content, you might want to ask:

*   Have I used someone else's trademark to sell or promote goods or services in a way that may confuse people?
*   Does my use of a trademark only refer to someone else's goods or services, or make some other type of non-infringing use of the trademark (e.g. using a trademarked word in its ordinary dictionary meaning, or using the trademark in a way that is not related to the sale or promotion of products or services)?

If you have questions about trademark law or whether your content infringes another party's trademark rights, you may want to seek legal advice.

Content that I posted on Facebook was removed because it was reported for intellectual property infringement. What are my next steps?
=====================================================================================================================================

When we receive a report from a rights owner claiming that content you posted on Facebook infringes their intellectual property rights, we may need to promptly remove that content from Facebook without contacting you first.

If we remove content that you posted because of an intellectual property report submitted through our online form, you'll receive a notification from Facebook that may include the name and email address of the rights owner who made the report and/or other details of the report. If you believe the content shouldn't have been removed, you can follow up with the rights owner directly to try to resolve the issue.

If you're an admin on a Page, and content that another admin posted on the Page was removed due to an intellectual property report, you'll receive a notification with information about the content that was removed, as well as the name of the other admin who posted it.

Appealing the removal of content
--------------------------------

If your content was removed because of a trademark report, you can submit an appeal. Instructions will be available for you in the notification that you receive from us in your Facebook account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/www/561080341172839?helpref=platform_switcher) about our appeals process.

How do I report trademark infringement on Facebook?
===================================================

Meta can't adjudicate disputes between third parties, and so we wouldn't be in a position to act on trademark reports that require an in-depth trademark analysis or a real-world dispute outside Facebook. In these situations, rather than contacting Meta, you may want to contact the party that you believe is infringing your rights directly, or seek any resolution in court or by other judicial means.

You can report trademark infringement to us by [filling in this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/ipreporting/report/trademark).

Please note that submitting a claim of trademark infringement is a serious matter with potential legal consequences. Before you submit a report, you may want to send a message to the person who posted the content and resolve the issue with them directly. You may be able to resolve the issue without contacting Meta.

Remember, only the trademark owner or their authorised representative may file a report of trademark infringement. If you believe something on Facebook infringes someone else's trademark, you may want to let the rights owner know.

Please note that we regularly provide the rights owner's name, your email and the details of your report to the person who posted the content you are reporting. This person may contact you with the information you provide. You may wish to provide a valid generic business or professional email for this reason.

Can I report a Facebook username for infringing my trademark?
=============================================================

[Usernames](https://www.facebook.com/help/105399436216001?helpref=faq_content) are generally claimed on a first-come, first-served basis. This means that you may see a Facebook Page or profile with a username that includes your trademark.

While there may be cases where this type of use can be reported for trademark infringement based on the context of its use, please note that not every use of your trademark in a username is necessarily a trademark infringement. A word or phrase that is used in a different context may not violate your trademark. Learn more about [trademark infringement](https://www.facebook.com/help/349534658401968?helpref=faq_content) in our Help Centre.

If you believe that a username infringes your trademark rights, you may want to contact the responsible person and try to resolve your issue with them directly. If you're sure that you want to report a username on Facebook that you believe infringes your trademark, you can do so by [reporting it to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/191999230901156?helpref=faq_content).

What you should consider before submitting a report of intellectual property infringement to Facebook
=====================================================================================================

Before you submit a report, please consider whether the content you want to report may be a permissible use of your [copyright](https://www.facebook.com/help/337995452911154?helpref=faq_content) or [trademark](https://www.facebook.com/help/719682678205946?helpref=faq_content). If you're not sure whether the content you're reporting infringes your intellectual property rights (e.g. because it may be a fair use), you may want to seek legal guidance.

Please note that submitting a report of intellectual property infringement is a serious matter with potential legal consequences. Intentionally submitting misleading or otherwise fraudulent reports of copyright or trademark infringement may lead to Facebook taking action, including termination of your account.

For copyright, it's important to note that intentionally submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may also lead to liability for damages under section 512(f) of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or similar laws in other countries.

What information do I need to include in a trademark report to Meta?
====================================================================

The fastest and easiest way to submit a report of trademark infringement to us is to [contact Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/191999230901156?helpref=faq_content). Whether you submit your report through our online form or another method, Meta needs the following information to be able to process your report:

*   Your complete contact information (full name, postal address and phone number)
*   The specific word, symbol etc. in which you claim trademark rights
*   The basis for your claim of trademark rights (such as a national or community registration), including registration number, if applicable
*   The country or jurisdiction in which you claim trademark rights
*   The category of goods and/or services for which you assert rights
*   Information that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on Facebook that you believe violates your trademark rights. The easiest way to do this is by providing web addresses (URLs) that lead directly to the allegedly infringing content. Learn [how to find a URL](https://www.facebook.com/help/2053403608222571?helpref=faq_content).

A description of how you believe this content infringes your trademark:

*   If you aren't the rights owner, an explanation of your relationship to the rights owner

A declaration that:

*   You have a good faith belief that use of the trademark described above, in the manner you have complained of, is not authorised by the trademark owner, its agent or the law
*   the information in your notice is accurate;
*   Under penalty of perjury, you are the owner or are authorised to act on behalf of the owner of a trademark that is allegedly infringed

Your electronic signature or physical signature:

*   Please note that we regularly provide the rights owner's name, your email address and the details of your report to the person who posted the content you are reporting. This person may contact you with the information you provide. For this reason, you may want to provide a valid generic business or professional email address.

Retract an intellectual property report that you've submitted to Facebook
=========================================================================

If you submitted an intellectual property report, but then reached an agreement with the person who posted the content, or if you reported content by mistake, you can withdraw your intellectual property report.

The best way to do this is to complete the retraction form provided to you in the email that you received when you filed your report. Alternatively, you can submit [this form.](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/237593160842825)

Once we receive your notice withdrawing your report, we'll restore the content if it has already been removed and send you an email confirmation. We may be unable to restore the content in certain instances, including due to technical limitations or if the content was removed for other reasons unrelated to your intellectual property report.

Facebook removed content as a result of my trademark report. What information is sent to the person who posted that content?
============================================================================================================================

When we receive [trademark reports](https://www.facebook.com/help/191999230901156?helpref=faq_content) and remove the reported content, we typically provide the person who posted the content with the following information:

*   Report number
*   Rights owner's name
*   Email address provided by the reporting party
*   Details of the report
*   Instructions on how to submit an appeal

The person whose content was removed may contact you with the information you provide. You may want to provide a valid generic business or professional email address for this reason.

In rare cases (such as when we are contacted by fax, post or email), we provide the report number and a description of the removed content. Meta may provide additional information if it's requested by the person who posted the reported content.

Copyright
=========

These articles provide information about copyrights, including how you can protect your own copyrighted works and avoid infringing the copyrights of others. We also provide information about how Facebook addresses reported copyright infringement. If you believe that someone is using your copyrighted work without your permission, you can report it by [filling in this form](https://www.facebook.com/help/ipreporting/report/copyright).

Laws in different countries may vary. For more information on copyright law, you can visit the website of the [US.

What is copyright and what does it protect?
===========================================

In most countries, copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship. Typically, if you create an original work, you have a copyright from the moment that you create it.

Copyright covers a wide variety of types of works, including:

*   Visual or audiovisual works: videos, films, TV shows and broadcasts, video games, paintings, photographs
*   Audio works: songs, musical compositions, sound recordings, spoken word recordings
*   Literary works: books, plays, manuscripts, articles, musical scores

Please note that only an original work is eligible for copyright protection. To be original enough for copyright protection, a work needs to be created by the author themselves and have some minimal amount of creativity.

Generally, names, titles, slogans or short phrases aren't considered to be original enough to qualify for copyright protection. For example, the symbol "+" is not likely to be subject to copyright, but a painting full of shapes and colours arranged in a unique pattern is likely to be protected by copyright.

Copyright generally doesn't protect facts or ideas, but it may protect the original words or images that express a fact or idea. This means that you may be able to express the same idea or fact as another author, as long as you don't copy that author's way of expressing that idea or fact. For example, a playwright may not be able to copyright the idea of a man waking up to repeat the same day over and over again, but the script for a play or movie expressing that idea could be subject to copyright.

How do you know if you own the copyright in a work
==================================================

In general, the person who creates an original work owns the copyright. For example, if you create a painting, you are likely to own the copyright in that painting. Similarly, if you take a photo, you are likely to own the copyright in that photo.

There may be situations where you might think you have a copyright in an original work, but you may not. For example:

*   If you appear in a photo or video, that doesn't necessarily mean you have a copyright in that photo or video ([learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/327689333983073/?helpref=faq_content) about what to do if you think a photo or video on Facebook might violate your privacy).
*   If you take a photograph of a sculpture, that doesn't mean you have the right to prevent someone else from also taking a photograph of the same sculpture.
*   If you create a work as part of your regular job responsibilities, you might not be the owner of the copyright in that work. Instead, there are circumstances where the law will consider your employer to be the "author" of that work for copyright purposes.

If you're not sure about the extent of your copyright in an original work, you may want to contact an attorney to advise you on your rights.

What rights do I have as a copyright owner?
===========================================

As a copyright owner, you have certain rights under the law. These include the right to stop others from copying or distributing your work, or from creating new works based on your work. Copyright infringement generally occurs when a person engages in one of these activities without the copyright owner's permission.

For example, when someone uploads your photo or video, they make a copy of that photo or video. The same is true if someone uses a song in the soundtrack to a video, even if they paid for a copy of that song on another service.

If you own a copyright, you have the right to grant permission to use your copyrighted work, as well as the right to prevent other people from using your copyrighted work without permission.

How long does copyright protection last?
========================================

Copyright protection doesn't last forever. Eventually, a work loses copyright protection and becomes part of the "public domain". Once a work is in the public domain, it's freely available for anyone to use.

A central purpose of copyright law is to encourage people to make creative works. For this reason, the public domain ensures that copyright owners obtain certain rights only for a limited amount of time. This balance between copyright law and the public domain gives the author an incentive to create, but also gives other people the ability to use the work without permission after the copyright has expired.

There are many factors that determine when a work becomes part of the public domain. Some of these factors include when and where the work was first published, the type of work and the publisher. For example, the Berne Convention – an international treaty about copyright – states that the copyright for most types of works must last at least 50 years after the author's death. Countries, however, are free to set longer copyright terms within their own laws.

How can I make sure that the content I post to Facebook doesn't violate copyright law?
======================================================================================

Under Facebook's [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) and [Community Standards](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F), you can only post content to Facebook that doesn't violate someone else's intellectual property rights. The best way to help make sure that what you post to Facebook doesn't violate copyright law is to only post content that you've created yourself. It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright when you post their content on Facebook, even if you:

*   Bought or downloaded the content (for example, a song from iTunes)
*   Recorded the content onto your own recording device (for example, a song playing in the background during a party, concert, sporting event or wedding)
*   Gave credit to the copyright owner
*   Included a disclaimer that you didn't intend to infringe copyright
*   Didn't intend to profit from it
*   Modified the work or added your own original material to it
*   Found the content available on the Internet
*   Saw that others posted the same content as well
*   Think the use is a [fair use](https://www.facebook.com/help/337995452911154?helpref=search&query=fair+us&sr=1&ref=contextual)

Questions to ask before posting content
---------------------------------------

*   Have I created all of the content myself?
*   Do I have permission to use all of the content included in my post?
*   Does my use of the content fall within an [exception to copyright infringement](https://www.facebook.com/help/337995452911154?helpref=faq_content)?
*   Is the content protected by copyright (for example, is it a short phrase, idea or public domain work?)

It's generally a good idea to get written permission from the author of the work before posting content on Facebook. You might be able to use someone else's content on Facebook if you've received permission from them, for example by obtaining a licence. You may also be able to use someone else's content if it's in the public domain, is covered by fair use or there is another exception to copyright.

What are fair use and other exceptions to copyright?
====================================================

Laws across the globe recognise that strict application of copyright laws in certain cases may be unfair or may inappropriately stifle creativity or stop people from creating original works, which would harm the public. These laws allow people to use, under certain circumstances, someone else's copyrighted work. Common examples include use for the purpose of criticism, commentary, parody, satire, news reporting, teaching, education and research.

The United States and some other countries follow the "fair use" doctrine, while other countries, including those in the European Union, provide other exceptions or limitations to copyright. These exceptions or limitations permit users to use copyrighted material where appropriate. You may want to seek legal advice if you have questions about the possibility to use someone else's copyrighted work within the limits set by the law.

**Fair use**

Though it can be difficult to know whether a particular use of copyrighted work is a fair use, the law offers some factors that you can consider:

1.  **The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for charity educational purposes:**
    
    Does the use transform or change the original work by adding new meaning, context or expression? For example, using a fashion photograph to discuss the amount of photo editing used in the photograph is more likely to be fair use than simply posting the photograph without comment. Parodies may be fair use if they imitate a work in a way that criticises or comments on the original work.
    
    Is the use commercial or purely personal? Commercial or for-profit uses are less likely to be considered fair use.
2.  **The nature of the copyrighted work:**
    
    The use of factual works like maps or databases is more likely to be fair use than the use of highly creative works like poems or science-fiction films.
    
3.  **The amount and substance of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole:**
    
    The use of small portions of a copyrighted work is more likely to be fair use than copying an entire work. But even if only a small portion is used, it is less likely to be fair use if that portion used is the most important piece – the "heart" of the work.
    
4.  **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work:**
    
    Will the use replace the original work such that people stop buying or viewing the copyrighted work? If so, this is less likely to be fair use.
    

To learn more about fair use in the US, you can visit the [US Copyright Office Fair Use Index](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcopyright.gov%2Ffair-use).

**Exceptions to copyright**

The application of exceptions and limitations to copyright may vary from country to country. Generally, in countries that rely on exceptions and limitations, the use of copyrighted works should not unreasonably harm a rights holder's interests.

In the EU, each Member State must ensure that users are able to rely on the following exceptions when making content available: quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche. To learn more about copyright law in the EU, you can visit the [EUIPO website](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Feuipo.europa.eu%2Fohimportal%2Fen%2Fweb%2Fobservatory%2Ffaqs-on-copyright).

Unintentional actions can still violate copyright on Facebook
=============================================================

It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright, even if you don't intend to do so. In most cases, you shouldn't use someone else's copyrighted work if you don't have permission. Posting content that facilitates copyright infringement through unauthorised devices or services is also not allowed on Facebook.

Bear in mind that your use of someone else’s content may infringe their copyright or facilitate copyright infringement, even if you:

*   Gave credit to the copyright owner
*   Included a disclaimer that you don't intend to infringe copyright
*   Think that the use [is a fair use](https://www.facebook.com/help/337995452911154?helpref=faq_content)
*   Didn't intend to profit from it
*   Bought or downloaded the content (e.g. a copy of a DVD or a song from iTunes)
*   Modified the work or added your own original material to it
*   Found the content available on the Internet
*   Recorded the content onto your own recording device (e.g. from a film, concert or sporting event)
*   Saw that others have posted the same content as well
*   Are using an unauthorised streaming device or service (e.g. a "jailbroken" or "loaded" app or service)

When we receive a report from a rights owner claiming that content you posted on Facebook infringes their intellectual property rights, we may need to promptly remove that content from Facebook without contacting you first.

If we remove content that you posted because of an intellectual property report submitted through our online form, you'll receive a notification from Meta that may include the name and email address of the rights owner who made the report and/or other details of the report. If you believe the content shouldn't have been removed, you can follow up with the rights owner directly to try to resolve the issue.

If you're an admin on a Page, and content that another admin posted on the Page was removed due to an intellectual property report, you'll receive a notification with information about the content that was removed, as well as the name of the other admin who posted it.

If content you posted in a group was removed due to an intellectual property report, the group admins will also be notified of the removal and the identity of the group member who posted the content that was removed.

Appealing the removal of content
--------------------------------

If your content was removed because of a copyright report, you can submit an appeal. You'll receive instructions about how to appeal in the message that we send you. Similarly, if the content was removed under the notice and counter-notice procedures of the [United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)](https://www.facebook.com/help/265723950293778?helpref=faq_content), you may be able to file a DMCA counter-notification. Again, instructions will be available for you in the message that we send you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/194353905193770?locale=en_US&helpref=faq_content) about our appeals process.

Group admins will be notified about content removed from their group due to intellectual property violations, but only the person who posted it will be able to submit an appeal.

How does Meta process United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) counter-notifications?
==================================================================================================

Meta complies with the notice-and-takedown procedures set out in section 512(c) of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which applies to content reported and removed for violating US copyrights.

If your content is removed under the DMCA, you'll receive instructions about how to file a counter-notification in the message that we send you. You should only submit a counter-notification if the content was removed because of a mistake or misidentification. Please note that if your content was removed for reasons unrelated to a copyright report, you may not receive a response from us.

When we receive a valid DMCA counter-notification, we forward it to the party that reported the content. The information they receive includes your contact information, which they can use to contact you.

If we provide your counter-notification to the party that reported the content, and they don't notify us that they have filed a court action seeking an order to keep the content down, we will restore or cease disabling eligible content under the DMCA. This process can take up to 14 working days. Please note, in rare instances, we may not be able to restore content because of technical limitations. If this happens, we'll send you an update letting you know you may repost the content at your discretion.

Content that is restored based on a valid DMCA counter-notification will not be counted against you under our [Repeat Infringer policy](https://www.facebook.com/help/350712395302528?helpref=faq_content).

What information you need to include in a copyright report to Meta
==================================================================

The fastest and easiest way to submit a claim of copyright infringement on Facebook to us is to [report it](https://www.facebook.com/help/325058084212425?helpref=faq_content). Whether you submit your report through our online form or another method, Facebook needs the following information to be able to process your report:

*   Your complete contact information (full name, postal address and phone number)\*.
*   A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed.
*   A description of the content on our site that you claim infringes your copyright.
*   Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on our site. The easiest way to do this is by providing web addresses (URLs) that lead directly to the allegedly infringing content.
*   A declaration that:

What tools does Facebook provide to help me protect my intellectual property in my videos?
==========================================================================================

In addition to our other measures, including our online reporting forms and our repeat infringer policy, we use systems that flag content posted to Facebook that may contain copyrighted content owned by someone else.

Rights Manager, Facebook's rights management technology, allows copyright owners to upload and maintain a reference library of video content that they want to monitor and protect, including live video streams. You may be able to use Rights Manager to take a number of actions on a video that matches your content, including:

*   **Block:** A blocked video is not viewable by anyone other than the person who posted it. If a blocked video is posted on a Page, it is not viewable by anyone other than administrators of that Page. You may be able to block a video worldwide or in specific countries where you own rights. Learn more about [blocking in Rights Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/156214071866178?id=237023724106807&helpref=faq_content).
*   **Claim ad earnings**: You may be able to claim money earned from a video that contains ad breaks. Your claim may apply to money earned from all views on a video or only views in specific countries where you own rights.
*   **Apply attribution**: You may be able to insert a banner below a video linking it to your own content. You may be able to apply this banner worldwide or only in specific countries where you own rights.
*   **Report**: You can use Rights Manager to send a copyright report to Facebook, which may result in the reported video being removed.
