This Policy describes the information that we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis&locale2=en_US), which we also call "Products".

What information do we collect?
===============================

Highlights
----------

In this Policy, we list the kinds of information that we collect. Here are some important ones. We collect:

*   The information that you give us when you sign up for our Products and create a profile, such as your email address, phone number or age

This includes what you click on or like, your posts and photos, your chats with [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe&locale2=en_US) and messages you send.

The information that we collect and process about you depends on how you use our [Products\[3\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A1-WhatInformationDoWe&locale2=en_US#annotation-3).

What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information that we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis&locale2=en_US), which we also call "Products".

4

Information that we collect and receive if you use or interact with our Products but don't have an account
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if you don't have an account, you may interact with or use [Meta Products\[3\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf&locale2=en_US#annotation-3). Then, we collect things such as:

*   Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, such as Facebook Pages and videos
*   Basic information about [devices\[11\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf&locale2=en_US#annotation-11) that downloaded our apps, such as device model and OS

We also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, such as the Meta pixel or Social plugins, when you visit other websites and apps that use our [business tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087/?helpref=uf_share&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf&locale2=en_US) or other Meta Products.

Examples of why we collect and receive information
--------------------------------------------------

### Security of our Products

For example, we collect information to monitor attempted attacks on our systems, such as overloading our servers with traffic. Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf&locale2=en_US) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.

### Safety and integrity

We can take action according to our Community Standards against someone without an account interacting with Meta Products. For example, we can share information with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.

### Advertising

For example, you may also see ads for the [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-company-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf&locale2=en_US) shown through [Meta Audience Network](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768/?helpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf&locale2=en_US) when you visit other apps if we can't recognise you as a registered user of the Meta Products.

### Performance

For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don't have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.

5

Information that you provide
----------------------------

For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, such as a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, such as a profile photo or payment information.

We also collect information you provide when you:

*   Create your avatar
*   Fill in a form
*   Contact us

6

What we collect from our camera feature
---------------------------------------

José likes using Instagram's Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo that he's about to take, we collect information from the camera, so we can apply the effect to his photo.

How filters, effects, masks and avatars work
--------------------------------------------

If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things such as fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It's not used to identify you.

What we collect from voice-enabled features
-------------------------------------------

Ren tells Meta's voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren's command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren's voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren's settings, improve the Assistant feature.

7

Metadata
--------

*   Information about the content itself, such as the location where a photo was taken or the date that a file was created
*   Information about the message itself, such as the type of message or the date and time that it was sent

8

Information that you or others exchange with AI at Meta
-------------------------------------------------------

Across Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta's generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange&locale2=en_US).

We collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:

*   Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information that you or others share with or send to AI at Meta
*   Responses and other information that you receive from AI at Meta. Sometimes, these are provided with the help of our [AI integrations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange&locale2=en_US#4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)
*   Actions that you ask AI at Meta to take, such as customising the content or ads that you see
*   Feedback that you give to AI at Meta about its responses

9

Apps and features that you use, and how you use them
----------------------------------------------------

For example, we log:

*   What apps, posts, videos, ads, games, Shops and other content you view or interact with on our Products
*   What features you access from our messaging products
*   When you use [Social plugins](https://developers.facebook.com/products/social-plugins/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.12-AppsAndFeaturesYou&locale2=en_US), [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/products/facebook-login/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.12-AppsAndFeaturesYou&locale2=en_US), in-app browser link history or auto-fill

---------------------------------------------------------

Identifiers we collect include device IDs, mobile advertiser ID or IDs from games, apps or accounts you use. We also collect Family device IDs or other identifiers unique to [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-company-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.26-IdentifiersThatTellYour&locale2=en_US) associated with the same device or account.

15

Device signals
--------------

Device signals include GPS, Bluetooth signals, nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and cell towers.

16

Related metadata
----------------

For example, if you give us permission to access your device's camera roll, we collect metadata. This metadata is from and about your photos and videos, and includes the date and time they were made. We use this to do things such as remind you when you have new photos to upload.

17

IP address
----------

Stands for "Internet protocol address". It's a unique number assigned to a device, such as a phone or computer, which allows it to communicate over the Internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a postal address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information about your network and connection includes:

*   The name of your mobile operator or Internet service provider (ISP)
*   Language
*   Time zone
*   Mobile phone number
*   IP address
*   Connection and download speed
*   Network capability
*   Information about other devices that are nearby or on your network
*   Wi-Fi hotspots you connect to using our Products

One reason why we collect this information is to make your experience better. For example, if we know that your phone and TV are connected to the same network, we can help you use your phone to control a video stream on your TV.

How do we use your information?
===============================

Highlights
----------

Here are some of the ways that we use your information:

*   We send you messages about the Products that you use or ones you might like, if you let us
*   We research for the good of people around the world, for instance to advance technology or to help out in a crisis

We use [information that we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse&locale2=en_US#1-WhatInformationDoWe) to provide a personalised experience to you, including ads, along with the other purposes that we explain in detail below.

For some of these purposes, we use information [across our Products\[26\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse&locale2=en_US#annotation-26) and [across your devices\[27\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse&locale2=en_US#annotation-27). The information that we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review\[28\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A2-HowDoWeUse&locale2=en_US#annotation-28) to access and review your information.

To use less information that's connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymise it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

Manual review
-------------

### Examples of when we use manual review

*   Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies, and keep content that doesn't break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf).
*   When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf&locale2=en_US), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.
*   We also use manual review to analyse content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.

### Who reviews this information

Our reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf&locale2=en_US) or for a trusted [service provider\[41\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf&locale2=en_US#annotation-41). We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.

What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information that we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis&locale2=en_US), which we also call "Products".

30

Your activity on our Products
-----------------------------

For example, William checks in to a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.

Your activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe shop or in an online chat with a shoe seller. The seller shares Jane's activity with us using our business tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.

Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online shop.

If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe shop again, she can hide them in her [Advertisers setting](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur&locale2=en_US). Or if she doesn't want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur&locale2=en_US).

Topics that we think you might be interested in
-----------------------------------------------

For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music".

Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.

Jon can manage his interests in his [ad topics](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_topics?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur&locale2=en_US).

Your connections
----------------

For example, Fiona's friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend's activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.

31

Other device signals we receive
-------------------------------

We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things such as nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

32

IP address
----------

Stands for "Internet protocol address". It's a unique number assigned to a device, such as a phone or computer, which allows it to communicate over the Internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a postal address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the Internet.

33

Personalising ads for you and others
------------------------------------

For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location services on his device and allowed location access in the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We'll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.

Later, Marcus turns off Location services before he lands, so we don't collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address that we receive to estimate Marcus' general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.

34

Helping to keep your account secure
-----------------------------------

For example, we use information about the locations that you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log in to your account from a new location, we can check that it's really you.

35

Partner
-------

A person, business, organisation or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

36

Information we provide about different types of people
------------------------------------------------------

For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25-34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.

37

Third party
-----------

A person, business, organisation or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

38

Providing more personalised features, content and suggestions across our Products
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example we can:

*   Automatically fill in registration information, such as your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product
*   Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you
*   Show all interactions in one place for content you've crossposted to different Products

39

Using your information if you add accounts to the same Accounts Centre
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if you follow your favourite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that team's Page on Facebook.

[Learn more](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/433719745369721/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.7-UsingYourInformationIf) about how we use information across accounts if you add accounts to the same Accounts Centre.

40

Device
------

Devices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.

41

Service provider
----------------

A person, business, organisation or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things such as investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

============================================================================

Highlights
----------

*   You can choose to share information on our Products or with integrated partners

----------------

Learn more about the different cases when your information can be shared on our [Products\[42\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A3-HowIsYourInformation&locale2=en_US#annotation-42):

People and accounts that you share and communicate with
-------------------------------------------------------

When you share and communicate using our products, you can sometimes [choose the audience\[43\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou&locale2=en_US#annotation-43) for what you share.

When you interact with people or businesses, they can see:

For example, the audience you choose who can see when you:

*   Share a post that you've written
*   Share a photo or video
*   Create a story
*   Share a news article
*   Add information to your profile

What you communicate with them
------------------------------

People you interact with can see what you send to them. So if you send a person or a business a message on Messenger or Instagram, that person or business can read your message.

When you're active
------------------

Some of our products might provide you with settings that allow others to see when you're active on our products, such as "active status". In some cases, we also offer settings that allow others to see when you're active in a particular section of one of our products, such as a message thread, game or event, or when you last used one of our products.

Learn how to update your Active Status on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/215888465102253?helpref=faq_content&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou&locale2=en_US) and [Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/278118979024443?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou&locale2=en_US), or how to update your activity status on [Instagram](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1164377657035425%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou).

When you interact with a supervised user
----------------------------------------

Some accounts are [supervised\[44\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou&locale2=en_US#annotation-44). When you interact with a supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information. This can include information, such as your username, profile picture and if the supervised user blocked you. On some Products, the supervised user can let their parent or guardian know if they reported you.

Content that others share or reshare about you.
-----------------------------------------------

Who can see or reshare your content
-----------------------------------

People in your audience can view your content and can choose to share it with others outside your audience, on and off our products. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends, they can download, screenshot or reshare it with anyone, on, across or off our products.

When you comment on a post or react to a photo, your comment or reaction can be seen by anyone who can see the post or photo. This can include people who you aren't connected to. The person who shared the post can also change their audience at any time after you've interacted with it.

When others interact with [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr&locale2=en_US), they can share information about you, including [messages and content that you have shared\[45\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.2-ContentOthersShareOr&locale2=en_US#annotation-45).

Who can see public content?
---------------------------

When content is public, it can be seen by anyone on or across our Products and in some cases, off our Products, even if they don't have an account.

For example, if you comment on Marketplace, a Facebook Page or a public Instagram account, or if you leave a rating or review, your comment, rating or review will be visible to anyone. It could appear in any of our products or be seen by anyone, including off our products.

Where can public content be shared?
-----------------------------------

We, you and people using our products can send public content (e.g. your profile photo or information that you share on a Facebook Page or public Instagram account) to anyone on, across or off our products. For example, users can share it in a public forum, or it can appear in search results on the Internet or our [research tools](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fresearchtools%2Fmeta-content-library%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A3.subpage.3-PublicContentWhatContent).

Public content can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services, such as:

With integrated partners
------------------------

You can choose to connect with [integrated partners\[47\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBSECTION%3A3.2-WithIntegratedPartnersYou&locale2=en_US#annotation-47) who use our Products. If you do, these integrated partners receive information about you and your activity.

These integrated partners can always access information that's public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an integrated partner's product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

Information they receive automatically
--------------------------------------

When you use an integrated partner's products or services, they can access:

*   What you post or share from these products or services
*   What you use their services to do
*   Information from and about the device you're using
*   The language setting that you've chosen on our Products

[See examples\[48\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn&locale2=en_US#annotation-48) of when an integrated partner might receive your information.

Information they receive with your permission
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes these integrated partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they'll explain what information they'd like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things such as your email address, home town or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content such as photos and videos that you've shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.\[49\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn&locale2=en_US#annotation-49)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an integrated partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the apps and websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

How long they can access your information
-----------------------------------------

Apps or websites that you've logged in to using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your non-public information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven't used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app's access to your information has expired, it can still retain information that you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your apps and websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

When you interact with someone else's content on an integrated partner's product or service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they're using the integrated partner's product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that live-stream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How integrated partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated partners handle the information that you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta's.

What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information that we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis&locale2=en_US), which we also call "Products".

43

Choosing an audience
--------------------

On Facebook, the audience can be made up of:

*   The public, including people on and off Facebook
*   Your friends and other connections, such as the friends of people you tag
*   A customised list of people
*   Yourself
*   The members of a single community, such as a group

On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account. With a [private account](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F448523408565555%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A3.ex.2-ChoosingAnAudienceOn), only followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. You can restrict the audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

-----------

Supervision provides supervisors chosen by a teen, such as parents and guardians, with tools and insights to help support a teen account.

45

Information that you or others exchange with AI at Meta
-------------------------------------------------------

Across Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta's generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange&locale2=en_US).

We collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:

*   Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information that you or others share with or send to AI at Meta
*   Responses and other information that you receive from AI at Meta. Sometimes, these are provided with the help of our [AI integrations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange&locale2=en_US#4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)
*   Actions that you ask AI at Meta to take, such as customising the content or ads that you see
*   Feedback that you give to AI at Meta about its responses

46

Search engines
--------------

You can visit your [privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A3.ex.5-SearchEnginesYouCan&locale2=en_US) to control whether search engines can show your profile or public photos and videos in search results outside Meta. Some public content might still be accessible through search engines, for example:

*   If you post with your audience or profile set to Public,
*   If you post on public Pages or accounts, depending on the settings of that account,
*   If your public content is reshared by a professional account on Instagram.

47

Integrated partner
------------------

A partner who uses technologies that help you make a connection to them through our Products, including plugins, login, checkout experiences, Instant Games and other such integrations

48

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.

When an integrated partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer automatically receives information about your "like" on their article.

49

Sharing friend lists
--------------------

### When you share your friend list

If you use Facebook Login to log in to an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:

*   They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can't access non-public information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
*   You'll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don't want to share your friends list with an app, or don't want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.

### When your friends share their friend list

Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your friends can't use Facebook Login to share non-public information about you.

How do we share information with third parties?
===============================================

Highlights
----------

We share certain information with:

*   Advertisers who show ads on our Products
*   Businesses we hire to market our Products for us
*   Businesses we hire to do things such as offer customer service or conduct surveys
*   Researchers who use it to do things such as innovate, advance technology or improve people's safety

We don't sell your information and we never will.

We don't sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also require [partners\[50\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare&locale2=en_US#annotation-50) and other [third parties\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare&locale2=en_US#annotation-51) to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information that we provide.

Here's more detail about who we share information with:

Partners
--------

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers
-------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads and commercial content. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser's ad or commercial content. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork&locale2=en_US#annotation-52).

Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:

*   Ads and commercial content people engaged with, if any
*   When people engaged with ads and commercial content
*   Where that ad or commercial content was shown (e.g. on Instagram or on Facebook)

We also confirm which ads or commercial content you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[53\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork&locale2=en_US#annotation-53)

### Audience Network publishers and their vendors

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

*   How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
*   Information related to or in response to a [publisher's request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork&locale2=en_US) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[53\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork&locale2=en_US#annotation-53).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our [Products\[54\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur&locale2=en_US#annotation-54), such as business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.

To provide these services, we use the [information that we collect](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur&locale2=en_US#1-WhatInformationDoWe) about you. We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things such as users' experience with such content, products and services.

These reports aggregate information such as:

*   How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services
*   The [general demographics and interests\[52\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur&locale2=en_US#annotation-52) of the people who interacted with it
*   How people use our partners' products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks

Advertisers also receive other information. [Read our Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur&locale2=en_US#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[55\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods&locale2=en_US#annotation-55), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[56\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods&locale2=en_US#annotation-56), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

*   Information to complete your transaction, such as order, payment, contact and delivery information
*   Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, such as information about your device or connection
*   Any information required by applicable regulation
*   Other information that you choose to share with them

For example, if you make a purchase from an Instagram shop using checkout, the shop will receive information to complete your transaction. This may include your order items, your contact details and delivery information. If the shop uses a payment services provider, such as PayPal, to facilitate the transaction, the provider will receive the transaction amount, a transaction description (to appear on your credit card statement) and your payment card information, such as cardholder name, card number, expiry date and billing address. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/357872324807367/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods&locale2=en_US) about payments on Instagram.

Integrated partners
-------------------

When you choose to use integrated partners' products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity. [Read the Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.8-IntegratedPartnersWhenYou&locale2=en_US#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Vendors
-------

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don't create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We share information (such as whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our [measurement vendors\[57\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.10-MeasurementVendors&locale2=en_US#annotation-57), who aggregate or compile it to provide their reports.

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help work out the impact that its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser's Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with [marketing vendors\[58\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.11-MarketingVendors&locale2=en_US#annotation-58). For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.

Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:

*   Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
*   Tracking and categorising your online and mobile app activity
*   Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalise which of our ads are shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

[Learn more\[59\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.11-MarketingVendors&locale2=en_US#annotation-59) about how to manage the Meta ads that you see off our Products.

Service providers
-----------------

*   Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
*   Facilitating payments
*   Providing customer support
*   Improving the functionality of our Products

Third parties
-------------

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

*   Our business or mission
*   Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide&locale2=en_US).

[Learn more](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fresearchtools%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SUBPAGE%253A4.subpage.14-ExternalResearchersWeProvide) about the privacy-safe research that we support.

AI integrations
---------------

Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. For example, that means that if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer. That's why we work with other selected partners, such as search engine providers. We sometimes share certain information with these partners so that we can bring you the most relevant information.

[Learn more about how we share your information with these selected partners](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations&locale2=en_US)

Other third parties
-------------------

We also share information with other [third parties\[51\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare&locale2=en_US#annotation-51) in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A4-HowDoWeShare&locale2=en_US#10-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, in some cases, we'll give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, but only as the law allows.

50

Partner
-------

A person, business, organisation or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

51

Third party
-----------

A person, business, organisation or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

52

General demographics and interests
----------------------------------

For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example, whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.

You can see the "interests" assigned to you in your [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A4.ex.4-GeneralDemographicsAndInterests&locale2=en_US) and remove them if you want.

The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:

*   Were women
*   Were between the ages of 25 and 34
*   Clicked on the ad from their phone

53

When you might give us permission
---------------------------------

For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information that you provided.

54

### Promoting safety, security and integrity, and complying with applicable law

For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. This includes:

*   Complying with their legal obligations
*   Helping keep you and others safe
*   Performing account verification

*   Use your Meta Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp
*   Chat with your friends on other Meta Company Products, such as smart glasses, by connecting your WhatsApp account

We also share information with Meta Companies to support innovation. For example, your videos can help train our products to recognise objects, such as trees, or activities, such as when a dog chases a ball. They can also help train tools that let people and businesses create content such as images and videos. This technology is used to help us offer new products or features in the future.

How long do we keep your information for?
=========================================

Highlights
----------

*   We keep information for as long as we need it to provide a feature or service
*   But you can request that we delete your information
*   We'll delete that information unless we have to keep it for something else, for instance for legal reasons

We keep information for as long as we need it to provide our products, comply with legal obligations or to protect our or other's interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here's what we consider when we decide:

*   If we need it to operate or provide our products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[66\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe&locale2=en_US#annotation-66).
*   The feature that we use it for and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger's vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[67\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe&locale2=en_US#annotation-67).
*   How long we need to retain the information for to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[68\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe&locale2=en_US#annotation-68).
*   If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we'll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our Policy\[69\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A8-HowLongDoWe&locale2=en_US#annotation-69) about when we may preserve your information.

66

If we need it to operate or provide our Products
------------------------------------------------

For example, we keep profile information, photos you've posted (and not deleted) and security information for the lifetime of your account.

And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your [activity log](https://www.facebook.com/0/allactivity?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.1-IfWeNeedIt&locale2=en_US) or delete your account. Once you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be [deleted\[70\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.1-IfWeNeedIt&locale2=en_US#annotation-70).

But even if you don't clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search, we delete information about that search that isn't necessary to show you your search history, such as information about the device you were using, or your location.

67

The feature we use it for, and how that feature works
-----------------------------------------------------

For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves the chat, and Cynthia will only see the message the first time she opens the chat thread.

After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it's deleted after 14 days.

68

How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for:

*   A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
*   A governmental investigation
*   A legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

69

Why we may preserve your information longer
-------------------------------------------

Your information, including financial transaction data related to purchases or money transfers made on our Products, may be preserved and accessed for a longer time period if it's related to any of the following:

*   A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
*   A governmental investigation
*   An investigation of possible violations of our terms or policies
*   To prevent harm
*   For safety, security and integrity purposes
*   To protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products
*   If it's needed in relation to a legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

[See some examples\[71\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A8.ex.3-WhyWeMayPreserve&locale2=en_US#annotation-71).

In some cases, we may preserve your information based on the above reasons even after you request deletion of your account or some of your content. We may also preserve information from accounts that have been disabled and content that has been removed for violations of our terms and policies.

### How long does it take to delete your information?

If you request that we delete your account or content, it may take up to 90 days to delete your information after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. After the information is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery.

If you leave your deleted content in your recycle bin on Facebook or your Recently deleted folder on Instagram, the deletion process will begin automatically in 30 days. Or you can start the deletion process straight away by deleting the content from your recycle bin or Recently Deleted folder.

Examples of why we might preserve your information

### To respond to a legal request

For example, we might preserve your information after you've deleted your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta's accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We might also preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, such as suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.

What Products does this Policy cover?
-------------------------------------

This Policy describes the information that we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis&locale2=en_US), which we also call "Products".

87

How our ads system works
------------------------

Our ads system works in the following way:

*   **We use your information to determine the ad interests most relevant to you.** We try to predict your ad interests based on the information that we have, including any choices that you've made in ad preferences.
*   **Advertisers tell us which audience they want to reach based on who they think will be most interested.** This can include things such as age, gender, location where advertisers want to show their ad or interests, such as women, based in Dublin, who like golf.
*   **We review the potential ads that we could show you to identify the most relevant ones.** Our ads system automatically reviews all of the potential ads where you might fit the audience that advertisers want to reach. For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things such as whether it best achieves the advertiser's goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads that we may show you. We use different factors, such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things such as your activity on Meta Products. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/447278887528796?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A11.ex.1-HowOurAdsSystemWorks&locale2=en_US).
*   **All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads.** When you see an ad on Meta Company Products, we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.

88

Metadata
--------

*   Information about the content itself, such as the location where a photo was taken or the date that a file was created
*   Information about the message itself, such as the type of message or the date and time that it was sent

AI at Meta
==========

We're developing generative AI experiences and are excited to bring them to more people and businesses across Meta Products worldwide. That's why we're developing AI at Meta, our collection of generative AI features and experiences, such as Meta AI and AI Creative Tools, along with the models that power them. This also includes making models available through an open platform to support researchers, developers and others in the AI community.

AI at Meta helps people solve complex problems, be more imaginative and create something never seen before. From bringing real-time answers to chat, to helping people organise and plan for their next holiday, to giving them more ways to express themselves, AI at Meta helps people enhance their everyday activities, experiences and moments.

We are committed to building responsibly. We want you to know how generative AI works and how we use your information to make this advancement possible.

What is generative AI?
----------------------

Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) enables people to quickly create content in new and exciting ways. For example, with generative AI people can easily create new content such as images to share with friends, and businesses can create text responses for questions from their customers.

Generative AI is not a database or static collection of information, but computer models. These models are a form of artificial intelligence that are trained on billions of pieces of information from different types of data such as text, images and audio. By studying this information, it can learn things such as the relationship and associations between different types of content. That way the models are able to create new content when a person gives it instructions or a question. Generative AI can be used to create a variety of content such as text, images and audio.

*   Models that generate text: Large language models (also called LLMs) are models trained on massive amounts of text to help them predict typical sequences, such as those found in our everyday language. LLMs learn from the data using a combination of machine learning and guidance given by people who help train the models. They can be trained to do different language-based tasks, such as completing a sentence, translating text into a different language or responding to questions in a conversational way.
*   Models that generate images: These models are trained by looking at billions of images and their text captions, which are the descriptive text associated with the images. The model learns the association between these text descriptions and the images. Once it's learned the association, it can create new images, such as when a person enters a text description of the image that they want generated.

Generative AI models help machines better understand the world and let people translate that understanding into creative expression.

Where does Meta get training information?
-----------------------------------------

As it takes such a large amount of data to teach effective models, a combination of sources are used for training. We use information that is publicly available online and licensed information. We also use information shared on Meta Products. This information could be things such as posts or photos and their captions. We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. For AI features that use [Private Processing technology](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffaq.whatsapp.com%2F2089630958184255%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SECTION%253Agenai_body), Meta cannot read or access the private messages that you have shared. There are more details on how we use information from Meta Products in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy?section_id=2-HowDoWeUse&entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body&locale2=en_US).

When we collect public information from the Internet or license data from other providers to train our models, it may include personal information. For example, if we collect a public blog post, it may include the author's name and contact information. When we do get personal information as part of this public and licensed data that we use to train our models, we don't specifically link this data to any Meta account.

Even if you don't use our Products or have an account, we may still process information about you to develop and improve AI at Meta. For example, this could happen if you appear anywhere in an image shared on our Products by someone who does use them or if someone mentions information about you in posts or captions that they share on our Products.

Privacy and generative AI
-------------------------

At Meta, we have a responsibility to protect people's privacy and have teams dedicated to this work for everything that we build.

We have a robust internal Privacy Review process that helps ensure that we are using data at Meta responsibly for our products, including generative AI. We work to identify potential privacy risks that involve the collection, use or sharing of personal information and develop ways to reduce those risks to people's privacy. [Read more about our privacy programmes and learn about our teams of experts.](https://about.meta.com/privacy-progress/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body)

To do this work ethically and responsibly, we have five foundational values at the core of how we think about AI. [Learn more about our five pillars.](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/facebooks-five-pillars-of-responsible-ai/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body&locale2=en_US)

*   Privacy and security
*   Fairness and inclusion
*   Robustness and safety
*   Transparency and control
*   Governance and accountability

Our AI responsibility efforts are propelled by a cross-disciplinary team whose mission is to help ensure that AI at Meta benefits people and society. Our work on responsible AI is driven by our belief that everyone should have equitable access to information, services and opportunities. [Learn about our recent progress.](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/responsible-ai-progress-meta-2022/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body&locale2=en_US)

We're investing so much in this space because we believe that it provides benefits for people, creators and businesses around the world. That's why we're building AI at Meta and making models available through an open platform. To train effective models to unlock these advancements, a significant amount of information is needed. This is why we draw from publicly available and licensed sources, as well as information that people have shared on Meta Products, including interactions with AI at Meta features. We keep training data for as long as we need it on a case-by-case basis to ensure that an AI model is operating appropriately, safely and efficiently. We also may keep it to protect our or others' interests, or comply with legal obligations.

Whether you use Meta Products or not, anyone can submit requests related to their personal information from third parties being used to develop and improve AI at Meta. [Learn more and submit requests here.](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1266025207620918?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body&locale2=en_US)

We see many possibilities ahead for people, creators and businesses to use generative AI. We're excited to see this technology come this far but know that there's more to do in the future. Generative AI is a fast-moving space and we are committed to staying transparent as this technology evolves.

Meta AI Verification Terms

Meta AI Verification Terms
==========================

UPDATED JUL 31, 2025

These AI Verification Terms supplement [Meta’s AI Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) and [Meta’s AI Disclosures](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/other-policies/meta-AI-disclosures/).

When you provide photos of yourself to improve your AI Images from Meta AI, Meta uses artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology to compare the provided photos with the live photos that you took of yourself during the initial setup to verify that they are of the same person. To work, the AI technology transforms the provided photos and live photos into embeddings representing your visual characteristics and compares the embeddings to verify that they were generated from photos of the same person. The embeddings will be used solely for this purpose and will be deleted within just a few seconds of creation.

By providing photos to improve your AI Images from Meta AI, you represent, warrant and agree that the photos that you provide are of you and do not include or otherwise incorporate any other person(s). You further expressly waive and release any claim that might be brought by you or on your behalf against Meta or any Meta affiliate alleging that these AI Verification Terms or the conduct described herein fail to comply with or otherwise violate in any respect the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14, or the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 503. If any aspect of this Paragraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable, that aspect shall be severed and not affect the validity or enforceability of any other aspect.

AI Disclosures

**UPDATED** 19 November 2025

These AI Disclosures supplement [Meta's AI Terms of Service.](https://www.facebook.com/policies/other-policies/ais-terms)

Creating images or videos of yourself using Meta AI, uses artificial intelligence ("AI") technology, developed by Meta, that allows you to generate and share imagined photos or videos of yourself in, for example, different contexts and settings. To work, each time that an image or video is generated, the AI technology transforms images or voice recordings (where available) of yourself that you provide into an embedding representing your visual or voice characteristics and uses the embedding to generate images or videos that may look or sound similar to you ("Generated Media"). This technology is not facial or voice recognition. The embedding, which cannot be used to identify you, will be deleted within just a few seconds of its creation.

When you create images or videos of yourself with Meta AI, Meta may use the images, videos and voice recordings (where available) that you provide and other information (for example, your prompt instruction) in accordance with [Meta's Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/), including to (a) evaluate how well the AI technology performed or (b) perform other business obligations, such as fulfilling any compliance obligations. When you share the Generated Media with other users, your prompt may also be shared with those users.

By creating images or videos of yourself with Meta AI, you represent, warrant and agree that the images and voice recordings that you provide are of you and do not include or otherwise incorporate any other person(s). You further expressly waive and release any claim that might be brought by you or on your behalf against Meta or any Meta affiliate alleging that these AI Disclosures or the conduct described herein fail to comply with or otherwise violate in any respect the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14, or the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 503. If any aspect of this Paragraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable, that aspect shall be severed and not affect the validity or enforceability of any other aspect.

By creating images or videos of yourself with Meta AI, you agree to the use of AI technology, and to the collection and use of your information as described above. You also understand that Meta AI may not accurately generate headwear or facial accessories captured during onboarding. This may result in such items being partially or fully omitted in images generated by Meta AI by yourself or other users.
