Overview
========

Effective from 1 January 2025

Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, websites, features, apps, services, technologies and software we offer (the [Meta Products](https://facebook.com/legal/meta-products) or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.

These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses, organisations and other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which personalised ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more about how personalised advertising under these Terms works on the Meta Products.

Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/) explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) pages of the relevant Meta Product at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.

1\. The services we provide
===========================

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:

1.1 Provide a personalised experience for you:
----------------------------------------------

Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in Facebook Feed or our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalise your experience.

1.2 Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:
------------------------------------------------------------------

We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.

1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate with friends, family and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos and stories across the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile, as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.

1.4 Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We show you personalised ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.

1.5 Promote the safety, security and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct such as this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-companies?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_1) when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief that it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_1).

In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more [here](https://www.oversightboard.com/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_1).

1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.

1.7 Research ways to make our services better:
----------------------------------------------

We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing data that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_1) explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.

1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-company-products?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_1) that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow on Facebook through Messenger.

1.9 Ensuring access to our services:
------------------------------------

To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centres, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or its affiliates.

2\. How our services are funded
===============================

Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you personalised ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off [Meta Company Products](https://facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_2). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalised ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.

Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalised ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, such as the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work [here](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_2).

We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_2). You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_2).

3\. Your commitments to Facebook and our community
==================================================

We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

3.1 Who can use Facebook
------------------------

When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:

*   Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
*   Provide accurate information about yourself;
*   Only create one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
*   Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).

We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:

*   You are under 13 years old.
*   You are a convicted sex offender.
*   We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F) or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F) or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
*   You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.

3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products
----------------------------------------------

We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1.  You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
    *   That violates these Terms, the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F), or [other terms and policies](#section_5) that apply to your use of our Products.
    *   That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
    *   That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    *   That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
2.  You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with or impair the proper working, integrity, operation or appearance of our services, systems or Products.
3.  You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such automated access or collection is undertaken while logged in to a Facebook account.
4.  You may not proxy, request or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
5.  Except as provided in the [Platform Terms](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), you may not sell, license or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while logged in to a Facebook account.
6.  You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative or groundless reports or appeals.
7.  You may not do, or attempt to do, anything to circumvent, bypass or override any technological measures that Meta uses to control or limit access to our Products or data.

We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.

If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the [Community Standards](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-standards%2F), we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2 below.

We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat misinformation. When content has been rated by fact-checkers, we may add a notice to provide additional context. You can find more information about fact-checking [here](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Ffeatures%2Fhow-fact-checking-works%2F).

To help support our community, we encourage you to [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=tos) content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including [intellectual property rights](https://www.facebook.com/help/intellectual_property?ref=tos)) or our Terms and Policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction. We also can remove or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.

3.3 The permissions you give us
-------------------------------

We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:

**1\. Your content:** Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.

You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and other [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-company-products) that you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.

However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "Licence") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.

**2\. Permission to use content that you create and share:** Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

**3\. Deleting your content:** You can delete individual content that you share, post and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/250563911970368/?helpref=hc_fnav) about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a Page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums that may continue to be visible to other album members.

It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we've begun the account deletion process or receives a content deletion request. If you send content to the bin, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:

*   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted);
*   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
*   Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    *   investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);
    *   protect the safety, integrity and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees and users, and to defend ourselves;
    *   comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data that Meta Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record-keeping obligations required by law; or
    *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.

**4\. Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content:** You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on Facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content such as this can only be seen by people who have your permission to see the actions that you've taken on Meta Products. You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads) about your ad settings and preferences.

**5\. Permission to update software that you use or download:** If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

3.4 Limits on using our intellectual property
---------------------------------------------

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos or sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or [trademarks (or any similar marks)](https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/meta/our-trademarks/) as expressly permitted by our [Brand Usage Guidelines](https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/meta/company-brand/) or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open-source licence) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile or reverse-engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the [Meta Bug Bounty Programme](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat). We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

[Return to top](#)

4\. Additional provisions
=========================

4.1 Updating our Terms
----------------------

We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests, or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.

We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.

We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms, or wish to terminate your agreement to this contract, you can [delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674?ref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4) your account at any time and you must also stop accessing or using Facebook and the other Meta Products.

4.2 Account suspension or termination
-------------------------------------

We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.

If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including, in particular, the [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4), we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

We may disable or delete your account if, after registration, your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time or if we detect that someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/3434203120011796?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4) about how we disable and delete accounts.

Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.

You can [learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/103873106370583?ref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4) about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake.

If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop accessing, using or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).

4.3 Limits on liability
-----------------------

We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "As is," and to the extent permissible by law, we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure or error-free or that they will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content that they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable content).

We cannot predict when issues may arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Meta Products (however caused and on any theory of liability, including negligence), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

4.4 Disputes
------------

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Meta Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action or dispute that Meta files against you, you and Meta agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, at its sole discretion, Meta may bring any claim, cause of action or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.

4.5 Miscellaneous
-----------------

1.  **Supplemental Terms:** Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our [Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4). If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4). If you use Avatars, then the [Avatar Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/avatars_terms?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4) also apply. If you use our AI products and features, the [Meta AI Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4) also apply. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
2.  **Severability:** If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and if it can't be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
3.  **No transfer:** You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
4.  **Legacy contact:** You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited [disclosure](https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997?ref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Asection_4) of information from your account after it has been memorialised.
5.  **No third-party beneficiaries terms.** These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
6.  **User name change:** We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
7.  **Feedback:** We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

Onsite Checkout Payments Features Terms and Conditions
======================================================

UPDATED SEP 23, 2025

**1\. Acceptance**

a. These “Onsite Checkout Payments Features Terms and Conditions” apply to your use of any onsite checkout payment feature or other payment feature we make available to you (**“you”** or **“Seller”**) in or through Meta Company Products (which are Meta Products and other products provided by the Meta Companies that are subject to separate, standalone terms of service and privacy policies) to allow Users to initiate payments to you in exchange for your goods or services (together, **“Payments Features”**). Any payment transaction initiated by a User to you using a Payments Feature is a **“Transaction”**.

b. These Onsite Checkout Payments Feature Terms and Conditions form part of the [Meta Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) and the [Seller Agreement](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commerce_product_merchant_agreement). The Payments Features are part of our “Platform” as defined in the Meta Platform Terms, so the Meta Platform Terms also govern your use of the Payments Features. If there is any conflict between these terms and the Meta Terms of Service, the [Seller Agreement](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commerce_product_merchant_agreement) or the Meta Platform Terms or any stand-alone terms of service for any Meta Company Products, these terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.

The Checkout Terms may be updated from time to time with notice when we make a significant change or without notice when we make a minor change, and, unless otherwise stated, your continued use of the Payments Features will be deemed acceptance of such updated Checkout Terms. If you do not agree to any update to the Checkout Terms, you must stop using the Payments Features.

**2\. Payment Providers**

a. Payments for Transactions will be processed by a third-party payment provider you have engaged (a **“Payment Provider”**), in accordance with their terms of service, and not by us.

b. Meta Platforms, Inc. (“**Meta**”) shall provide infrastructure necessary for you to connect with and link your payment account with a Payment Provider to the Meta Company Products platform, including Instagram’s Payments in chat service and / or payments on WhatsApp. You agree and acknowledge that Meta, WhatsApp and/or any Meta Company will not accept, collect, receive, transmit, process, store or otherwise maintain any possession, custody or control of any funds paid by any User, or received by any Seller in connection with any Transactions.

Please see Section \[18\], below, for specific terms that apply to you with respect to the Payment Provider for Instagram’s payments in chat and Section 19 for specific terms applicable to WhatsApp payments in chat.

For the purpose of calculating Applicable Taxes, you agree that title to your goods purchased by Users as your customer, will pass directly from you to the User at the point of delivery.

You agree to accurately characterize, assign and maintain Product Tax Categories (**“Tax Characterization”**) for each good or service sold pursuant to these Checkout Terms. Your Tax Categorization is deemed effective upon posting your goods or services to the platform. Where available, you may opt-in to our automatic category tool that assigns a Product Tax Code on your behalf. For Marketplace Provider Jurisdictions referenced in Section 14(b), these Tax Categories will be used to calculate and remit tax to the appropriate taxing authority on your behalf.

d. The following terms apply to any tool we provide that allows you to estimate Applicable Taxes (**“Tax Calculation Tool”**).

*   Except for Applicable Taxes collected and remitted by Meta pursuant to Section 14(b) of these Checkout Terms, we provide no representation, warranty, guarantee, or advice, and we disclaim any responsibility to verify, the following: (a) the accuracy of the tax rules or methodology in the Tax Calculation Tool, (b) the application of taxes to your goods or of the tax jurisdiction assignment functionality tax rates of Applicable Taxes, and (c) whether or not the amounts we collect on your behalf satisfy your obligations to collect Applicable Taxes.

The Tax Calculation Tool calculates tax based on the entire amount of the Transaction (including sale price, shipping fees and any other charges subject to tax).

e. You must maintain documentation of all relevant tax information, including records of paying all Applicable Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. You represent that the tax registration number and all other information you provide to us are accurate and current, and you will immediately update any such information in the event of changes. We reserve the right to confirm the validity of your seller account information (including your tax registration number) and request additional information from you or government authorities as permitted by law. You agree to provide information to us upon request within the time period prescribed.

Except for Applicable Taxes collected and remitted by Meta pursuant to Section 14(b) of these Checkout Terms, you agree that we are not obligated to determine whether Applicable Taxes and Other Fees apply, and we are not responsible to collect, report, or remit any taxes arising from any Transaction.

g. You agree that no class action lawsuits may be brought against Meta by you or on behalf of Users, as your customer, arising from or in any way related to the overpayment of Applicable Taxes collected by Meta on your behalf, pursuant to these Checkout Terms, regardless of whether such action is characterized as a refund claim, notwithstanding your and your customer’s right to seek a refund directly from the relevant taxing jurisdiction.

h. You will notify us immediately if you become aware of any actual or potential claim, cause of action, investigation, tax notice or audit, or other type of dispute that could affect your ability to fully comply with these Checkout Terms or which otherwise relates to your rights to use the Payments Features.

**16\. Use of Information**

You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed may be different from those of your own country.

c. Payments Processing Services. Payments for Instagram’s payments in chat are processed by PayPal, Inc., an unaffiliated third-party payments provider, with which you have a direct relationship.

When you or others interact with AIs, those interactions include information you or others exchange with AIs like Content or messages, along with information we use to make responses from AIs more relevant (like your interests, location and profile).
        
        When information is shared with AIs, the AIs will sometimes retain and use that information. Do not share information that you don’t want the AIs to use and retain, such as information about sensitive topics.
        
        Meta may share certain information with select partners, like search engines, to provide you with the most relevant information in connection with our AIs. [Learn more about how we share information with these partners.](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners) By using AIs, you instruct us to share information for this purpose.
        
        In some cases, Meta will review your interactions with AIs, including the content of your conversations with or messages to AIs, and this review may be automated or manual (human). When you share your private messages with friends and family with AIs that use Private Processing technology, Meta cannot read or access the messages you have shared. Meta provides Private Processing as a service on your behalf.
        
        Depending on where you reside, you or an authorized agent may have the right to request access to your personal information from Meta in a portable format, deletion of your personal information, or correction of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.
