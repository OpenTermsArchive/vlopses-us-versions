### We do not tolerate videos depicting individuals under 18 years old, and will remove all such content when notified and report the matters to law enforcement.

If you notice inappropriate content and suspect it depicts individuals who are underage, please report it and we will process that report immediately. You can report anonymously and in doing so we will not process any of your personal data when investigating unless you provide it.

To report such a video, click on the ABUSE REPORTING FORM button below the video player. Select “Child sexual abuse” or “Non-consensual sexual acts ” as a reason and make sure to add additional information to help us process and verify the report so we can remove the material as quickly as possible. The more information you can provide us to identify and verify such illegal content, the more quickly we can remove and report it.

Please note that sending emails instead of using the form above will result in longer delays for content removal. Keep in mind we receive many emails, including those that do not contain sufficient information to allow us to take action.

### We do not want underage content. Do not upload any illegal content, including any content depicting underage individuals.

XNXX invests heavily in fighting the online display and distribution of child sexual abuse material and non-consensual sexual acts, including by implementing monitoring measures and tools that allow the detection and removal of illegal images. XNXX will report any conduct contrary to law to the appropriate authorities.

XNXX collaborates with international and national law enforcement authorities in its fight against child sexual abuse material or non-consensual sexual acts and has implemented a tool for preventing and combating the loading, display and dissemination of child sexual abuse material or non-consensual sexual acts. In addition to allowing authorities to download the video in question, this tool discloses information that includes the following:

*   date of video upload;
*   date of video cancellation:
*   email of the uploader;
*   IP address of the uploader;
*   the port of the IP address;
*   the video url;
*   thumbnails of the video and for each url.

All reports of content involving minors are forwarded to law enforcement agencies of various countries, depending on the IP address of the uploader. Pedophile videos and videos of non-consensual sexual acts get special attention. You have been warned. DO NOT DO IT.

Take these measures to prevent your kids from stumbling upon adult sites :

### ACTIVATE SAFE MODE IN SEARCH ENGINES

Xnxx will never appear in the search results with these filters.

Google :  
[https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510)

Bing :  
[https://www.bing.com/account](https://www.bing.com/account)

Yahoo :

### WINDOWS 10 FAMILY FEATURES

Once your child has been added to your family with a Microsoft account, you'll be able to set up appropriate website and app and game restrictions for their age, set PC time limits, and review their recent activity. Their settings will apply to any Windows 10 device that they sign in to.

### CONTROL THE APPS IN YOUR TABLETS AND PHONES

Both Google Play store and Apple app stores are already kind of kids-friendly as they do not allow any porn-related app. But you might want to control app installs anyway :

### REQUEST A FILTER FROM YOUR ISP

Your Internet Service Provider likely has solutions to filter your internet connection at their level. Contact them to find out.

Note that this will block Xnxx even for you.
