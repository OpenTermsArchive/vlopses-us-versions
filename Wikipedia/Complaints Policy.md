1\. UCoC Enforcement Guidelines
-------------------------------

These Enforcement Guidelines describe how the community and Wikimedia Foundation achieve the goals of the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC). This includes, among other topics: promoting understanding of the UCoC, engaging in proactive work to prevent violations, developing principles for responsive work to UCoC violations, and supporting local enforcement structures.

The UCoC applies to all online and offline Wikimedia spaces. Therefore, enforcing the UCoC is a shared responsibility. In line with the movement principle of decentralisation, the UCoC should be enforced at the most relevant local level possible.

The Enforcement Guidelines provide a framework for the interaction of current and future enforcement structures, seeking to create the groundwork for an equitable and consistent implementation of the UCoC.

### 1.1 Translations of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines

The original version of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines is in English. It is translated into various languages used on Wikimedia projects. The Wikimedia Foundation makes its best efforts to have accurate translations. If any difference arises in the meaning between the English version and a translation, decisions by the U4C must be based on the English version.

### 1.2 Review of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines

The Universal Code of Conduct Coordinating Committee leads annual reviews of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines.

2\. Preventive work
-------------------

This section aims to provide guidelines for Wikimedia communities and affiliated individuals to be aware of the UCoC, to fully understand and adhere to it. To that end, this section details recommendations for raising awareness of the UCoC, handling translations of the UCoC, and promoting voluntary adherence to the UCoC where appropriate or necessary.

### 2.1 Notification and confirmation of the UCoC

The UCoC applies to everyone who interacts and contributes to Wikimedia projects. It also applies to official in-person events, and related spaces hosted on third party platforms as a baseline of behavior for collaboration on Wikimedia projects worldwide.

The UCoC is part of the Wikimedia Terms of Use.

Additionally, the following individuals need to confirm their adherence to the UCoC:

*   All Wikimedia Foundation staff and contractors, Board of Trustees members, Wikimedia affiliate board members and staff;
*   Any representative of a Wikimedia affiliate or aspiring Wikimedia affiliate (such as, but not limited to: an individual, or group of individuals who is seeking to promote and/or collaborate a Wikimedia sponsored event, group, study, either on or off-wiki in a research setting); and
*   Any individual who wants to use the Wikimedia Foundation trademark in an event such as, but not limited to: events branded with Wikimedia trademarks (such as by including them in the event's title) and representation of the Wikimedia organization, community, or project at an event (such as, but not limited to, a presenter or a booth operator).

#### 2.1.1 Promoting UCoC awareness

In order to improve awareness, a link to the UCoC will be accessible on or at:

*   User and event registration pages;
*   Footers on Wikimedia projects and edit confirmation pages for logged-out users (where appropriate and technically possible);
*   Footers on the websites of recognized affiliates and user groups;
*   Prominently communicated at in-person, remote, and hybrid events; and
*   Anywhere else deemed appropriate by local projects, affiliates, user groups, and event organizers

### 2.2 Recommendations for UCoC training

The U4C, with support from the Wikimedia Foundation, develops and implements training to provide a common understanding of the UCoC and skills for its implementation. Relevant stakeholders must be consulted in the development of training, including, but not limited to: Affiliates, the Affiliations Committee, Arbitration Committees, Stewards and other Advanced Rights Holders, T&S and legal, and others as it deems beneficial to providing a complete view of the UCoC.

These trainings are for people who want to be part of UCoC enforcement processes, or those who want to be informed about the UCoC.

The training will be set up in independent modules covering general information, identification of violations and support, and complex cases and appeals. The U4C is responsible for maintaining and updating the training modules as needed.

Training modules will be available in different formats and on different platforms for easy access. Local communities and Wikimedia Affiliates who want to provide training at their community level will get financial support from the Wikimedia Foundation to implement training. This includes support for translations.

Participants who complete a module must have the option of having their completion publicly acknowledged.

The following sets of trainings are proposed:

**Module A - Orientation (UCoC - General)**

*   Help to ensure a common understanding of the UCoC and its implementation
*   Explain concisely what the UCoC is and its expected enforcement, as well as what tools are available to help report violations

**Module B - Identification and Reporting (UCoC - Violations)**

*   Give people the ability to identify UCoC violations, understand reporting processes and learn how to use reporting tools
*   Detail the type of violation, how to identify reportable instances in their local context, how and where to make reports, and optimal handling of cases within UCoC processes
*   Training will also focus on specific parts of the UCoC, such as harassment and abuses of power (as required)

**Modules C - Complex cases, Appeals (UCoC - Multiple Violations, Appeals)**

*   These modules are a prerequisite to joining the U4C, and are recommended for prospective U4C applicants and advanced rights holders
*   This module should cover two specific topics:
    *   C1 - Handling complex cases (UCoC - Multiple Violations): Cover cross-wiki cases, long term harassment, identifying credibility of threats, effective and sensitive communication, and protecting the safety of victims and other vulnerable people
    *   C2 - Handling appeals, closing cases (UCoC - Appeals): Cover handling UCoC appeals
*   These modules will be instructor-led and tailored trainings, provided to U4C members and applicants, and community-elected functionaries who have signed the Access to Nonpublic Personal Data Policy
*   When possible the materials for these instructor-led trainings, such as individual modules, slides, questions, etc., will be publicly available

3\. Responsive work
-------------------

This section aims to provide guidelines and principles for processing reports of UCoC violations, and recommendations for local enforcement structures dealing with UCoC violations. To that end, this section will detail important principles for processing reports, recommendations for the creation of a reporting tool, suggested enforcement for different levels of violations, and recommendations for local enforcement structures.

### 3.1 Principles for filing and processing of UCoC violations

The following principles are standards for reporting systems across the Movement.

Reports:

*   Reporting of UCoC violations should be possible by the target of the violation, as well as by uninvolved third parties that observed the incident
*   Reports shall be capable of covering UCoC violations, whether they happen online, offline, in a space hosted by a third party, or a mix of spaces
*   It must be possible for reports to be made publicly or with varying degrees of privacy
*   Credibility and verifiability of accusations will be investigated thoroughly to properly assess risk and legitimacy
*   Users who continually send bad faith or unjustified reports risk facing loss of reporting privileges
*   Accused individuals shall have access to the particulars of the alleged violation made against them unless such access would risk danger or likely harm to the reporter or others' safety
*   Where possible and necessary, the Wikimedia Foundation will provide translation resources for reports

Processing violations:

*   Outcomes shall be proportional to the severity of the violation
*   Cases shall be judged in an informed way, which makes use of context, in alignment with the principles of the UCoC
*   Cases shall be resolved within a consistent time frame, with timely updates provided to participants if it is prolonged

Transparency:

*   Where possible, the group that processed the UCoC violation will provide a public archive of those cases, while preserving privacy and security in non-public cases
*   The Wikimedia Foundation will publish basic statistics about usage of the central reporting tool proposed in section 3.2, while honoring the principles of minimal data collection and respect for privacy.
    *   Other groups that process UCoC violations are encouraged to provide basic statistics about UCoC violations and reporting as they are able, while honoring the principles of minimal data collection and respect for privacy.

#### 3.1.1 Providing resources for processing cases

Enforcement of the UCoC by local governance structures is supported in multiple ways. Communities choose from different mechanisms or approaches based on several factors such as: the capacity of their enforcement structures, approach to governance, and community preferences. Some of these approaches can include:

*   An Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) for a specific Wikimedia project
*   An ArbCom shared amongst multiple Wikimedia projects
*   Advanced rights holders enforcing local policies consistent with the UCoC in a decentralized manner
*   Panels of local administrators enforcing policies
*   Local contributors enforcing local policies through community discussion and agreement

Communities handle enforcement through existing means where they do not conflict with the UCoC.

#### 3.1.2 Enforcement by type of violations

This section details a non-complete list of the different types of violations, along with the potential enforcement mechanism pertaining to it.

*   Violations involving threats of any sort of physical violence
    *   Handled by the Wikimedia Trust & Safety team
*   Violations involving litigation or legal threats
    *   Sent to the Wikimedia Foundation Legal team, or, when appropriate, other professionals who can appropriately evaluate the merit of the threats
*   Violations involving the nonconsensual disclosure of personally identifiable information
    *   Generally handled by users with oversight or edit suppression permissions
    *   Occasionally handled by Trust & Safety
    *   Sent to the Wikimedia Foundation Legal team or, when appropriate, other professionals who can appropriately evaluate the merits of the case if this kind of violation invokes a legal obligation
*   Violations related to affiliate governance
    *   Handled by the Affiliations Committee or equivalent body
*   Violations in technical spaces
    *   Handled by Technical Code of Conduct Committee
*   Systemic failure to follow the UCoC
    *   Handled by U4C
    *   Some examples of systemic failure include:
        *   Lack of local capacity to enforce the UCoC
        *   Consistent local decisions that conflict with the UCoC
        *   Refusal to enforce the UCoC
        *   Lack of resources or lack of will to address issues
*   On-wiki UCoC violations
    *   UCoC violations that happen across multiple wikis: Handled by global sysops and stewards and the bodies that handle single-wiki UCoC violations or handled by the U4C where they do not conflict with these guidelines
    *   UCoC violations that happen on a single wiki: Handled by existing enforcement structures according to their existing guidelines, where they do not conflict with these guidelines
        *   Simple UCoC violations such as vandalism should be handled by existing enforcement structures through existing means, where they do not conflict with these guidelines
*   Off-wiki violations
    *   Handled by the U4C where no local governance structure (e.g. ArbCom) exists, or if the case is referred to them by the enforcement structure that would otherwise be responsible
    *   In some cases, it is helpful to report the off-wiki violations to enforcement structures of the relevant off-wiki space. This does not preclude existing local and global enforcement mechanisms from acting on the reports
*   Violations at in-person events and spaces
    *   Existing enforcement structures often provide rules of behavior and enforcement in off-wiki spaces. These include friendly space policies and conference rules
    *   Enforcement structures handling these cases can refer them to the U4C
    *   In instances of events hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, Trust & Safety provides event policy enforcement

### 3.2 Recommendations for a reporting tool

A centralized reporting and processing tool for UCoC violations will be developed and maintained by the Wikimedia Foundation. It will be possible to make reports through MediaWiki with this tool. The purpose is to lower the technical barrier for reporting and processing UCoC violations.

Reports should include relevant actionable information or provide a documentation record of the case at hand. The reporting interface should allow the reporter to provide details to whomever is responsible for processing that particular case. This includes information such as, but not limited to:

*   How the reported behavior violates the UCoC
*   Who or what has been harmed by this violation of the UCoC
*   The date and time at which the incident(s), occurred
*   The location(s) of the incident(s)
*   Other information to allow enforcement groups to best handle the matter

The tool should operate under the principles of ease-of-use, privacy and security, flexibility in processing, and transparency.

Individuals charged with enforcing the UCoC are not required to use this tool. They may continue to work with whatever tools they deem appropriate, as long as cases are handled according to the same principles of ease-of-use, privacy and security, flexibility in processing, and transparency.

### 3.3 Principles and recommendations for enforcement structures

Where possible, existing local enforcement structures have the responsibility of receiving reports of and dealing with UCoC violations, in accordance with the guidelines stated here. To ensure that enforcement of the UCoC remains consistent across the movement, the following baseline principles are applied when handling UCoC violations.

#### 3.3.1 Fairness in process

Enforcement structures must develop and maintain supportive conflict-of-interest policies. These should help admins or others determine when to abstain or disengage from a report when they are closely involved in the issue.

All parties will usually have the opportunity to give their perspective on the issues and evidence, and feedback from others can also be invited to help provide more information, perspective, and context. This may be limited to protect privacy and safety.

#### 3.3.2 Transparency of process

The U4C, in line with its purpose and scope as defined in 4.1, provides documentation on the effectiveness of UCoC enforcement actions and their relation to common violations throughout the movement, supported by the Wikimedia Foundation in conducting this research. The goal of this documentation is to aid enforcement structures in developing best practices for enforcing the UCoC.

Wikimedia projects and affiliates, when possible, shall maintain pages outlining policies and enforcement mechanisms in line with the UCoC policy text. Projects and affiliates with existing guidelines or policies in contradiction to the UCoC policy text should discuss changes to conform with global community standards. Updating or creating new local policies should be done in a way that does not conflict with the UCoC. Projects and affiliates may request advisory opinions from the U4C about potential new policies or guidelines.

For Wikimedia-specific conversations occurring on related space hosted on third party platforms (e.g. Discord, Telegram, etc.), Wikimedia's Terms of Use may not apply. They are covered by that specific website's Terms of Use and conduct policies. Nevertheless, the behavior of Wikimedians on related space hosted on third party platforms can be accepted as evidence in reports of UCoC violations. Wikimedia community members who moderate Wikimedia-related spaces on third party platforms are required to incorporate the UCoC into their policies. The Wikimedia Foundation encourages best practices for third-party platforms that discourage the continuation of on-wiki conflicts to their spaces.

#### 3.3.3 Appeals

An action taken by an individual advanced rights holder will be appealable to a local or shared enforcement structure. Local communities may allow appeals to a different individual advanced rights holder. If no local enforcement structure exists, then an appeal to the U4C is permissible.

Enforcement structures set standards for accepting and considering appeals based on relevant contextual information and mitigating factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: verifiability of the accusations, the length and effect of the sanction, and whether there is a suspicion of abuse of power or other systemic issues, and the likelihood of further violations. The acceptance of an appeal is not guaranteed.

Appeals are not possible against certain decisions made by the Wikimedia Foundation Legal department. However, some Wikimedia Foundation office actions and decisions are reviewable by the Case Review Committee. The limitation, specifically on appeals from office actions and decisions, may not apply in some jurisdictions, if legal requirements differ.

Enforcement structures should seek informed perspectives on cases in order to establish a basis to grant or decline an appeal. Information should be handled sensitively, with care for the privacy of the people involved and the decision-making process.

To achieve this goal, enforcement structures are encouraged to consider different factors when reviewing appeals. These may include, but not be limited to:

*   The severity and harm caused by the violation
*   Prior histories of violations
*   Severity of sanctions being appealed
*   Length of time since the violation
*   Analysis of the violation in contact
*   Suspicions of a possible abuse of power or other systemic issue

4\. UCoC Coordinating Committee (U4C)
-------------------------------------

The Universal Code of Conduct Coordinating Committee (U4C) is a co-equal body with other high-level decision-making bodies (e.g. ArbComs and AffCom). Its purpose is to serve as final recourse in the case of systemic failures by local groups to enforce the UCoC.

### 4.1 Purpose and scope

The U4C monitors reports of UCoC breaches, and may conduct additional investigations and take actions where appropriate. The U4C will regularly monitor and assess the state of UCoC enforcement. It may suggest suitable changes to UCoC, the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines, and U4C Charter for the Wikimedia Foundation and the community to consider, but may not change these documents on its own. When necessary, the U4C will assist the Wikimedia Foundation in handling cases.

The U4C:

*   Handles complaints and appeals in the circumstances outlined in the Enforcement Guidelines
*   Performs any investigations necessary to resolve said complaints and appeals
*   Provide resources for communities on UCoC best practices, such as mandatory training material and other resources as needed
*   Provides a final interpretation of the UCoC Enforcement Guidelines and the UCoC if the need arises, in collaboration with community members and enforcement structures
*   Monitors and assesses the effectiveness of UCoC enforcement, and provides recommendations for improvement

The U4C will not take cases that do not primarily involve violations of the UCoC, or its enforcement. The U4C's responsibilities are explained in the context of other enforcement structures in 3.1.2.

### 4.2 Selection, membership, and roles

Annual elections, organized by the global community, will select up to 16 voting members.

In exceptional circumstances, the U4C may call interim elections, if it determines that resignations or inactivity have created an immediate need for additional members. Elections will be in a format similar to that of the regular annual elections.

The Wikimedia Foundation may appoint up to two non-voting members to the U4C and will provide support staff as desired and appropriate.

### 4.3 Policy and precedent

The U4C does not create new policy and may not amend or change the UCoC. The U4C instead applies and enforces the UCoC as defined by its scope.

As community policies, guidelines and norms evolve over time, previous decisions will be taken into account only to the extent that they remain relevant in the current context.

5\. Glossary
------------

Administrator (sysop or admin)

See [definition](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Administrator "m:Special:MyLanguage/Administrator") on Meta-Wiki.

Advanced rights holder

user who holds administrative rights above typical editing permissions, and is generally elected through community processes or appointed by Arbitration Committees. This includes, as a non-exhaustive list: local sysops / administrators, functionaries, global sysops, stewards.

Affiliations Committee or Affcom

See [definition](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Affiliations_Committee "m:Special:MyLanguage/Affiliations Committee") on Meta-Wiki.

Arbitration Committee or ArbCom

group of trusted users who serve as the final decision making group for some disputes. An ArbCom is considered a high-level decision making body only for the parts of the UCoC that are within its scope, as defined by its community. An ArbCom may serve more than one project (e.g. Wikinews and Wikivoyage) and/or more than one language. For the purposes of these guidelines, this includes the Code of Conduct Committee for Wikimedia Technical Spaces and administrative panels. See also the [definition](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Arbitration_Committee "m:Special:MyLanguage/Arbitration Committee") on Meta-Wiki.

Binding verbs

When drafting the Enforcement Guidelines, the drafting committee considered the words 'create', 'develop', 'enforce', 'must', 'produce', 'shall', and 'will' as binding. Compare this to _recommendation verbs_.

Case Review Committee

See [definition](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Case_Review_Committee "m:Special:MyLanguage/Case Review Committee") on Meta-Wiki.

Community

Refers to a project's community. Decisions made by a project's community are generally determined by consensus. See also: Project.

Cross-wiki

Affecting or occurring on more than one project. See also: Global.

Event safety coordinator

a person designated by the organizers of an in-person Wikimedia-affiliated event as responsible for that event's safety and security.

Global

Referring to all Wikimedia projects. In the Wikimedia movement, "global" is a jargon term referring to Movement-wide governing bodies. It generally is used to contrast against "local".

Global sysops

See [definition](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Global_sysops "m:Special:MyLanguage/Global sysops") on Meta-Wiki.

High-level decision-making body

A group (i.e. U4C, ArbCom, AffCom, Stewards) beyond which there can be no appeal of UCoC enforcement. Different issues may have different high-level decision-making bodies. This term does not include a group of users participating in a discussion organized at a noticeboard and resulting in a decision, even if the results of that discussion cannot be appealed.

Local

Referring to a single Wikimedia project, affiliate, or organisation. This term usually refers to the smallest, most immediate governing body applicable to the situation.

Off-wiki

Generally refers to online spaces that are not hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, even if Wikimedia community members are present and actively using the space. Examples of off-wiki spaces include Twitter, WhatsApp, IRC, Telegram, Discord, and others.

Personally identifiable information

is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another and can be used to deanonymize previously anonymous data is considered PII.

Project (Wikimedia project)

A wiki operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.

Recommendation verbs

When drafting the Enforcement Guidelines, the drafting committee considered the words 'encourage', 'may', 'propose', 'recommend', and 'should' as recommendations. Compare this to _binding verbs_.

Related space hosted on third party platforms

Websites, including private wikis, not operated by the Wikimedia Foundation but where users discuss project matters relevant to Wikimedia. Often moderated by Wikimedia volunteers.

Staff

Employees of and/or staff members assigned to a Wikimedia movement organization or contractors of such a movement organization whose work requires interaction with Wikimedia community members or in Wikimedia movement spaces (including third-party spaces such as off-wiki platforms dedicated to Wikimedia movement activity).

| [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Walnut.svg/40px-Walnut.svg.png)](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Walnut.svg) | This page in a nutshell: Sometimes the Wikimedia Foundation may have to enforce a global ban against an individual without going through the typical site/community process(es). This is an extraordinary measure to help assure the safety of users of the Wikimedia projects and/or assist in preventing prohibited behavior that hinders dialogue, project development and expansion. This page details the policy and practices regarding the revocation of access or editing privileges of users on any Wikimedia site, as implemented by the Wikimedia Foundation. |

A **Foundation global ban** is an [office action](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Office_actions "Special:MyLanguage/Office actions") the Foundation may take, pursuant to our [Terms of Use](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en), in order to address multi-project misconduct, to help ensure the safety of the editing and reading communities of all Wikimedia sites, the public, or to assist in preventing prohibited disruptive behavior that interferes with contributions and dialogue. A global ban is applied to individuals representing themselves or others and is an extraordinary action that only supplements, without replacing, the [community global ban process](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Global_bans "Special:MyLanguage/Global bans").

The procedures followed by the Trust & Safety team when considering and implementing a Foundation global ban can be found under the [relevant process page](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/WMF_Global_Ban_Policy/procedure "Special:MyLanguage/WMF Global Ban Policy/procedure").

For the safety and privacy of users, the projects, and itself, the Wikimedia Foundation refers potential criminal violations to the relevant authorities, when appropriate.

Purpose and scope
-----------------

The purpose of this policy is to help improve the safety of Wikimedia community members, the movement itself, and the public in circumstances where actions on local community governance level are either insufficient or not possible.

Global and project-specific bans are also implemented by local Wikimedia community governance mechanisms. Foundation global bans are not a replacement for on-wiki processes, and are not to be used to correct perceived “mistakes” that resulted from legitimate on-wiki process; local policies remain primary on all Wikimedia projects, as explained in the [Terms of Use](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en), and Foundation global bans are complementary to those local policies. However, there may be some rare cases where the Wikimedia Foundation must override local policy to protect the safety of the Wikimedia communities or the public or preserve the sites, especially when the Foundation has access to information that cannot be shared with local policy enforcers.

Bans under this policy refer to global bans implemented by the Foundation; any equivalent bans performed by the communities are explicitly called out. Accordingly, the terms “global ban” or “ban” under this policy refer to global bans implemented by the Foundation, even though similar bans may be placed by the Wikimedia Community.

This policy has been published to aid in transparency and understanding, but the document here records rather than establishes policy. Any updates to policy will be recorded as soon as possible, but may go into effect before the public document is changed. Changes to this document, unless made by designated Foundation staff, may not reflect official policy and practice. Questions about changes or current practice may be addressed at the talk page or emailed to ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org.

Implications of a global ban
----------------------------

A global ban prohibits individuals, either in their own capacity or as agents of others, from all editing or other access privileges in Wikimedia Foundation websites, platforms and activities. This includes, but is not limited to, any site listed at [www.wikimedia.org](https://www.wikimedia.org/), mailing lists hosted by the Foundation, Wikimedia Cloud Services and Wikimedia technical infrastructure such as Phabricator as well as any in-person events hosted, sponsored or funded by the Foundation. Accordingly, an individual globally banned by the Foundation may not edit, contribute, or otherwise modify any content on those sites, platforms, or lists, without the explicit permission of the Wikimedia Foundation. Additionally, a globally banned individual may not coordinate activity that results in the aforementioned situations on Foundation sites, platforms and activities, via others. Whether the banned individual or others believe the outcome of such activities would be positive or not, such activities are prohibited by the ban. Further involvement to the Wikimedia projects by the globally banned user, after their ban, does not diminish the ban’s scope or validity. Any contributions made by a banned individual, directly or indirectly, may be reverted or removed as part of ban implementation.

Criteria for consideration of a global ban
------------------------------------------

Foundation global bans are considered a last resort and are generally implemented upon receipt of complaint, investigation, extensive review and explicit approval by [several Foundation staff members](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Office_actions/procedures "Special:MyLanguage/Office actions/procedures").

**They are considered an appropriate course of action when any of the following situations apply:**

*   there is a lack of ability by the communities to self-police the above scenarios or take action to resolve or mitigate them;
*   all possible community-led efforts to address the situation have been attempted and seem to have failed;
*   the Foundation has knowledge of a situation that we can not make public; such instances may include, but are not limited to, situations that involve personally sensitive information, are linked to an ongoing police investigation or court proceedings, or may present a security risk.

**In combination to any of the aforementioned situations, activity that may lead to a Foundation global ban includes, but is not limited to:**

*   engaging in significant or repeated harassment of users on multiple projects;
*   engaging in significant or repeated harassment off of the Wikimedia sites so as to threaten (emotionally or physically) users;
*   endangering, significantly compromising or otherwise threatening the trust or safety of our users or employees;
*   repeatedly or egregiously violating our [Terms of Use](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en), such as through hosting illegal content on Wikimedia servers; or
*   threatening or compromising the security of Wikimedia infrastructure.

Parties affected by a global ban
--------------------------------

A Foundation global ban is placed against an individual instead of against a specific username. It therefore applies to any alternate accounts an individual may control and any accounts they might create after the ban has been enacted. It can also apply to anonymous / “IP accounts” the banned individual may be using or may use in the future. As noted above, it applies to any action initiated by such individuals, including if conducted on their behalf by other parties.

Notice of global bans
---------------------

When a Foundation global ban is implemented, a brief, public note of a global ban appears on the affected individual’s user account, or on their primary user account, when they have been using multiple accounts. The same note appears on their account’s talk page. The banned individual’s account is also linked from the [Foundation’s Globally banned users](#List_of_global_bans_placed_by_the_Wikimedia_Foundation) list.

On the day the ban goes into effect, globally banned users are notified of their status and appeals options privately, when possible, unless such notification increases a credible threat to the victim or other users, or such notification hinders an ongoing investigation. Private notification of a global ban is issued via email, when the user has registered it or submitted it through a Wikimedia site or platform. If no email address is available, no private notice is issued.

Notice of a global ban may also be issued to the reporting individual(s), as a matter of courtesy.

Appeals
-------

Some office actions, including global bans, [may be appealed](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Office_actions#Appeals "foundation:Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Office actions"). With regards to office actions undertaken around investigations into the behavior of specific users, the volunteer [Trust & Safety Case Review Committee](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Trust_and_Safety/Case_Review_Committee "Special:MyLanguage/Trust and Safety/Case Review Committee") has been formed to review appeals of eligible Trust & Safety office actions until a permanent process is created through the Universal Code of Conduct Conversations. Only individuals directly involved in a case may request review, either as an individual who requested the initial case or as an individual under investigation. Reviews may be requested following our decision (i.e whether or not to take an office action). Instructions to submit appeals may be found on the [Trust & Safety Case Review Committee](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Trust_and_Safety/Case_Review_Committee "Special:MyLanguage/Trust and Safety/Case Review Committee") page.

Requesting a global ban
-----------------------

Requests for a global ban consideration can be placed to the Foundation’s [Trust and Safety](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Trust_and_Safety "Special:MyLanguage/Trust and Safety") (T&S). To expedite consideration of the request, it should include the following:

*   a succinct summary of the reasons for the request;
*   evidence (URLs) that there have already been attempts to have the issue resolved through local community governance structures, where such efforts are appropriate;
*   any crucial information and evidence in support or the request, including pertinent documentation. This can include, but is not limited to, URLs to the abusive conduct being reported, community-led investigations concerning the reported individual, screenshots of off-wiki information (when directly relevant to the request), etc;
*   if the request regards a situation taking place in a language other than English, it is helpful to also provide English translations of any key texts, as this speeds up the review process.

Requests for global bans made through any other venue, including Wikimedia project talk pages, personal messaging forums, or in person, may not be considered.

If a global ban is deemed appropriate according to policy, this may be implemented by any member of the Trust & Safety team, as prescribed by the [Office actions policy](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Office_actions#Who_performs_office_actions? "Office actions"). It should be noted that not all requests for a global ban result in implementation of such; in some situations the Foundation may proceed with alternative office actions instead, or no actions, depending on the outcome of the evaluation process. The lack of action (or the lack of public action) does not necessarily mean that a report has been perceived as invalid or illegitimate. The majority of on-wiki or user conduct issues are appropriately dealt with by the community, and the Wikimedia Foundation will default towards deferring issues to community wherever possible.

Timeline of global bans
-----------------------

Requests for consideration of a global ban are typically handled within a 4-week timeframe. This may be extended depending on the material that needs to be reviewed. For instance, requests for a global ban against users of non-English speaking communities may extend the review, as translation may be time-consuming.

General information
-------------------

A Foundation global ban is one of several [office actions](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Office_actions "Special:MyLanguage/Office actions") the Foundation may enforce. It is important to help clarify a few points regarding Foundation global bans, in addition to [office actions in general](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Office_actions#general "Special:MyLanguage/Office actions"):

#### Positive contributions to the projects and a global ban are not mutually exclusive.

Extensive positive contribution to the Wikimedia projects does not grant immunity against a global ban; neither does holding of a respected position within a local Wikimedia community, membership in an affiliate group or position with the Foundation. Consideration for a global ban is based on the merits of the reported activity, which may not be offset by an individual’s positive prior contribution to the Wikimedia movement, if that activity falls within one of the aforementioned scenarios.

#### Breaches to a global ban are not acceptable.

Breaches to a Foundation global ban may result in immediate actions against the banned individual; those may include, but are not limited to, global locks, IP address blocks, IP range blocks or content removal.

#### Helping a globally banned user evade their ban may result in sanctions.

Knowingly facilitating the contributions of a globally banned individual, acting as a proxy for such a person, or attempting to interfere with Foundation staff or volunteer administrators, bureaucrats or functionaries enforcing a global ban in line with relevant policies may result in sanctions, including loss of advanced user rights or suspension of contributing access to Wikimedia sites. Instances of enabling a globally banned user to evade a ban can be brought to the Foundation’s attention by notifying T&S at ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org.

#### Details of global bans are confidential.

In order to protect the privacy of all parties involved, the Wikimedia Foundation generally will not publicly or privately comment on the reason for any specific banning action. The immediately affected individual may reach out to T&S, via ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org, should they need clarifications to any of the notices they have received regarding their global ban and further information may be provided as a courtesy. However, we will not share any information that may identify the reporting parties, compromise their right to report their experiences and/or concerns privately, or place the reporting party in danger. We will also not negotiate the merits of the ban.

#### Global bans are not automatic.

Foundation global bans – which are used only in extraordinary circumstances – are never automatic. Instead, they are based on extensive individual evaluation, triggered by specific circumstances. A recommendation for a global ban goes through several layers of review by Foundation staff members, including by the Trust & Safety manager, the Trust and Safety Director, the Community Engagement Chief Director, the General Counsel (or appropriate delegate) and, in many cases, the Executive Director. It is possible for a global ban recommendation to be dismissed at any point in the process. Only when all necessary reviewing parties have granted their unanimous approval, is a global ban implemented.

There may be many reasons a global ban is not implemented. In some situations, a global ban may compromise the privacy and safety of the reporting and immediately affected individual(s), even if we don’t share information about them with the reported person. In other situations, enforcing a global ban may hinder ongoing police work. It’s also possible that reported conduct may rise to the level of community or Foundation sanctions, but not necessarily to that warranting a Foundation global ban.

#### Non-users may also be subject to a global ban.

Global bans are usually implemented against individuals who have been active contributors to the Wikimedia projects at some point. However, it is also possible for individuals who have never made contributions to the projects to be prohibited from accessing or participating in any websites or activities supported, sponsored or funded by the Wikimedia Foundation. This is because global bans are not restricted to people who have some kind of affiliation with the projects; rather they are implemented when an individual’s activity constitutes a serious threat to the trust and safety of the editing and reading communities of any Wikimedia project and/or they disrupt contributions and dialogue.

#### Questions about this policy.

For further information about Wikimedia Foundation global bans, questions may be left on the discussion page of this policy, or sent by email to the [Trust and Safety team](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Trust_and_Safety "Special:MyLanguage/Trust and Safety") at ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org. Please note that questions about specific global bans enforced by the Foundation will not be addressed, to protect the privacy of all involved. You may find [further information on community banned users](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/List_of_globally_banned_users "Special:MyLanguage/List of globally banned users").

This page is a official policy, established by and endorsed by the Foundation as necessary for the operation of the sites under its jurisdiction.

Notice

In February 2024, this page was updated to expand the range of Office Actions to include minor updates to the appeals process as well as ensuring that repeat offenders have been previously warned before issuing a global ban (except in sufficiently severe cases) for regulatory compliance. Typos, linguistic issues and broken links to external resources were also fixed.

| [![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Walnut.svg/40px-Walnut.svg.png)](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Walnut.svg) | This page in a nutshell: Sometimes the Wikimedia Foundation may have to delete, protect, blank a page or take other actions without going through the normal site/community process(es) to do so. These changes may be temporary or permanent measures to prevent legal trouble or personal harm and _should not be undone_ by any user. |

The office actions policy is a set of guidelines and regarding official changes to or removals of content on the Wikimedia projects, or actions against specific individuals, performed by Foundation staff members and under the authority of the Wikimedia Foundation, upon receipt of one or multiple complaints from the community or the public, or as required by law. Complaints that may lead to enforcement of office actions may include, but are not limited to, , , or systematic . All office actions are performed pursuant to the .

Purpose and scope
-----------------

The purpose of this policy is to help improve the actual and perceived safety of Wikimedia community members, the movement itself, and the public in circumstances where actions on local community governance level are either insufficient or not possible. Local policies remain primary on all Wikimedia projects, as explained in the , and office actions are complementary to those local policies. However, there may be some rare cases where the Wikimedia Foundation must override local policy, such as in complying with valid and enforceable court orders to remove content that might otherwise comply with policy or in protecting the safety of the Wikimedia communities or the public.

Some of the actions described or referenced in this policy mirror actions also taken by the Wikimedia communities and local governance mechanisms. All actions mentioned under this policy refer to actions taken by the Foundation and any equivalent actions performed by the communities are explicitly called out. For example, the terms "global ban" or "event ban" under this policy refer to global bans and event bans enforced by the Foundation respectively even though similar bans may be placed by Wikimedia affiliates or the Community.

Primary office actions
----------------------

The Foundation does not hold editorial or supervisory control over content and conduct in the Wikimedia projects; this work is done by a largely autonomous community of volunteers who, in accordance with our , create their own policies meant to uphold the educational goals of our movement. However, in cases where community actions have not been effective and/or legal considerations require us to intervene, we may take actions accordingly.

**Foundation global ban**

A is one of the most severe actions the Foundation may take in order to address misconduct or serious threats to the safety of users, the public or the projects, pursuant to our . It is performed primarily in order to help assure the actual and perceived safety of users of the Wikimedia projects and assist in preventing prohibited behavior that hinders contributions and dialogue. Situations that may lead to a Foundation global ban include, but are not limited to:

*   Users engaging in significant or repeated harassment of users on multiple projects;
*   Users engaging in significant or repeated harassment off of the Wikimedia sites so as to threaten (emotionally or physically) users;
*   Place in danger, significantly compromise or otherwise threaten the trust or safety of our users or employees;
*   Users repeatedly or egregiously violating our , such as through hosting illegal content on Wikimedia servers; or
*   Threatening or compromising the security of Wikimedia infrastructure.

In some cases, a Foundation global ban will be issued following Terms of Use violations that - individually - would not be sufficient enough to warrant a global ban, but form part of a broader pattern of seriously problematic conduct. In those cases, the global ban will typically be issued only after prior warnings (from the community, and/or the Foundation). However, the Foundation reserves the right to impose a global ban directly, in sufficiently severe cases of repetitive Terms of Use violation, or where it has not been practical to offer warnings. A global ban prohibits individuals, either in their own capacity or as agents of others, from all Wikimedia Foundation websites, platforms and activities. This includes, but is not limited to, any site listed at www.wikimedia.org, mailing lists hosted by the Foundation, Wikimedia Cloud Services and Wikimedia technical infrastructure such as Phabricator as well as any in-person events sponsored or funded by the Foundation. Accordingly, an individual globally banned by the Foundation may not participate in, edit, contribute, or otherwise modify any content on those sites, platforms, or lists without the explicit permission of the Wikimedia Foundation.  

A global ban is placed against an individual instead of against a specific username. It therefore applies to any alternate accounts an individual may control and any accounts they might create after the ban has been enacted. It can also apply to anonymous / "IP accounts" the banned individual may be using or may use in the future.  

Global bans are considered a last resort and are only enforced upon receipt of complaint, investigation, extensive review and explicit approval by several Foundation staff members. As they prohibit all involvement in the Wikimedia projects, websites, platforms and activities from the moment they are enacted, by definition they also prohibit potentially positive future involvement of the banned individual, regardless of the outcome of that involvement. Knowingly facilitating the contributions of a globally banned individual, acting as a proxy for such a person, or attempting to interfere with Foundation staff or volunteer administrators, bureaucrats or functionaries enforcing a global ban in line with local policies may result in sanctions, including loss of advanced user rights or suspension of contributing access to Wikimedia sites. Since global bans are reserved for severe cases, their duration should typically be expected to be indefinite.  

**Foundation event ban**

A is an office action enforced in order to help improve the actual and perceived safety of users attending Wikimedia in-person events. It is placed under exceptional circumstances such as repeated abuse or behavior that compromises the trust and safety of our volunteers or users. While not limited to these examples, Foundation event bans may be enacted in situations such as where:

*   Users have already exhibited or have threatened to exhibit harassing or otherwise abusive conduct during in-person events.
*   Users have already exhibited or indicated intention to attend in-person events in bad faith or to systematically undermine discussions and collaboration in pursuit of the Wikimedia mission and vision.

An event ban restricts the access, attendance and/or participation of individuals at offline events that are sponsored or funded by the Wikimedia Foundation or, in some cases, associated entities (such as movement affiliates or partners). This is not an action unique to the Foundation; local Wikimedia communities may also enact event bans under when they feel that a ban will help maintain the trust and safety of community members and users attending offline events. Event bans imposed by the Foundation may be subject to different criteria than those developed and observed by affiliated movement organizations, but are intended to complement them.

Being banned from local events does not automatically mean that one is banned from all global events. The terms of one event ban can differ from those of another and may depend on multiple variables. For example, Foundation event bans can be:

*   Location specific. One may be banned in all in-person events taking place within a certain geographical area, such as a city or a country.
*   Project specific. They may be applicable to any events relating to work and/or collaboration on particular projects or language projects, such as work on MediaWiki, Wikiprojects or the English Wikipedia.
*   Time specific. Event bans may not necessarily be indefinite; they may be placed for a specific period.

While an event ban may be lifted if it is found that it has served its purpose, continued abuse from the banned user may weigh into a decision by the Foundation to expand the ban. If notice of an event ban does not include a specific expiration date or note that it is irrevocable, an appeal may be sent to ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org. (Event bans that are part of global bans or lead to global bans are not subject to appeal.)

Event bans may be one step before a global ban, as they are placed in situations where a complaint has been placed to the Foundation regarding user conduct that specifically occurs or may occur during in-person events. They may, however, exist in isolation, if the issue leading to the event ban is not a concern in online interaction or behavior.

Pursuant to this and the Foundation event bans policy, names or pseudonyms of individuals explicitly (through an event ban) or implicitly (through a global ban) banned from attending events may be made available to designated teams or individuals within an event organization team/safe space committee/chapter, in the form of the event bans list. The list may include more identifying information if available, including photographs to help in identification.

**DMCA compliance**

The Foundation encourages people to first consider taking advantage of the existing community-led processes in order to report and resolve instances of copyright infringement. This can be done by reaching out to the Wikimedia volunteer email response team () at info![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org with an informal request for content removal, including all relevant information in support of your request such as the location of the reported material and well as information that helps establish copyright ownership and the legality or illegality of the material's use.

In some cases, the Foundation may also receive requests to remove content from a Wikimedia Project through a formal DMCA takedown process. Before , the Foundation reviews every DMCA notice we receive to ensure that it complies with the requirements of the DMCA statute and United States copyright law. We reject notices that we do not believe are legally valid. Upon review of the request by the Foundation's Legal team, the removal itself will usually be performed by a Support & Safety team member, using their staff account. In the spirit of transparency, the Foundation informs the Wikimedia community each time it performs a DMCA takedown through (also for Commons-based requests), as well as through aggregate statistics, in its biannual .

Removals of material due to receipt of a valid DMCA notice can be challenged. The recourse for restoring such material is to file a counter-notice with the Foundation. Please note that filing a counter-notice may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership of the material. The DMCA process requires that you consent to the jurisdiction of a United States court. If you believe there is no legal basis for a takedown notice which has been acted upon by the Foundation, you are welcome to visit the following sites, as a first step in learning about filing a counter-notice:

*   [Lumen Copyright FAQ](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/5)
*   [Lumen DMCA Notices FAQ](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/29)
*   [Lumen DMCA Counter-Notice Claiming Fair Use](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/22)
*   [EFF on DMCA](https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca)
*   [Digital Media Law Project on Responding to a DMCA Take-down notice](https://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/responding-dmca-takedown-notice-targeting-your-content)
*   [New Media Rights Sample DMCA CounterNotice letter when claiming fair use of a copyrighted work](https://www.newmediarights.org/guide/legal/copyright/dmca/Sample_DMCA_CounterNotice_letter_when_claiming_fair_use_of_a_copyrighted_work)
*   [The United States Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/)

As with all office actions, reverting DMCA notice takedowns without appropriate legal reasons is strongly discouraged. As a matter of policy, the Wikimedia Foundation will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of repeat infringers as provided under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 512). In most cases, it will also terminate the accounts of users who, upon being notified that content they have contributed has been removed as a result of a DMCA complaint, revert that removal.

**Child protection**

The safety of minors is extremely important for us, and we go to great lengths to help assure it. To that effect, if we believe minors are at risk, we will take actions right away. These actions aim at mitigating both conduct as well as content promoting child abuse. Child abuse may be discussed educationally as part of the content of Wikimedia projects, but never promotionally or with the purpose of titillation.

Pursuing or facilitating inappropriate adult–child relationships is not acceptable in the Wikimedia projects. This type of activity may include, but is not limited to, posting child pornography or any material depicting inappropriate sexual acts between adults and minors that violate applicable law, distributing or trafficking obscene material against minors that is unlawful under applicable law, conducting communications with under-aged users through the Wikimedia projects in an attempt to groom them or attempting to move their communications to platforms outside of the Wikimedia projects for grooming purposes, or attempting to approach minors inappropriately during Wikimedia in-person events.In contrast, contact for the purpose of organising and running school-related editathons is acceptable. Read more about our .

Concerns about child safety are reviewed and appropriate actions are taken as a matter of priority. Instances we believe to be child pornography, including information brought to our attention through requests for nonpublic user information, are reported to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.com/home) (NCMEC), in line with our . If your request has already been reported to NCMEC or relates to a case being handled by NCMEC, please include the case or report information in your request. The Foundation may also take additional actions against individuals found be engaging in such activities such as alerting local or international law enforcement.

Secondary office actions
------------------------

The actions listed under this section are generally performed at the Foundation's discretion, as a possible outcome of evaluation of a separate report. Direct requests for these actions will generally be deferred to appropriate community governance mechanisms. In the past, the Foundation has only taken these actions under extraordinary circumstances.

**Conduct warning**

A conduct warning is issued when a situation is observed to be problematic and is meant to be a preventative measure of further escalation. It is considered as a step geared towards de-escalation of the situation, when this is believed to have sufficient margin for it. It informs the recipient that behavior they may consider acceptable is in fact not, grants them the opportunity to reflect on it, and encourages them to take corrective measures towards mitigating and eventually eliminating it.

A conduct warning will usually be issued by the Foundation in situations where a contributor's online or/and offline behavior is considered borderline abusive, disruptive or otherwise hinders the collaborative process, but does not yet rise to the level of corrective actions. Such a warning will typically aim to address the type of conduct that may include, but is not limited to, repeated personal attacks, edit/status warring, impersonation or otherwise inappropriate in-person commentary and behavior.

No data has been compiled on how well conduct warnings succeed, and the Wikimedia Foundation lacks the resources to provide ongoing counseling to warned individuals on how to modify behaviors. However, while the Foundation does not believe that positive contributions outweigh harmful behaviors, there may be some circumstances where a warning is offered as a courtesy to contributors who may be otherwise sanctioned by an event or global ban. Warnings will be given only after an extensive evaluation, including review by multiple relevant staff, and will be issued confidentially. Their intent is not to shame the individual or escalate the situation, but to offer a contributor believed to be working in good faith an opportunity to cease behaviors that will otherwise lead to sanctions.

**Removal of advanced rights**

In extremely rare situations, the Foundation may become aware of circumstances and information regarding major breaches of trust performed by Wikimedia functionaries or other users with access to advanced tools. It may not be possible to share some or all of that information with the Wikimedia communities due to privacy reasons and therefore can not be handled through existing community governance mechanisms. In some of those cases the abuses reported may not rise to the level of irreversibly expelling Wikimedians from the communities; however, they may be severe enough to have breached the community's trust in the individuals involved and therefore warrant removal of administrative rights.

Removal of user rights are usually either permanent or long term. Rebuilding trust is not impossible, which is why individuals are encouraged to reflect on their actions leading up to their advanced rights removal and consider how they may best serve the communities moving forward. In situations of long term removals, and once the no-rights period has elapsed, a contributor may have to fulfill additional criteria before they are permitted to reapply for advanced rights; those are made known to them at the time of the removal of advanced rights.

Use of advanced rights by Foundation staff
------------------------------------------

There is a wide range of administrative actions that may be performed by the Wikimedia Foundation during evaluation of reports of misconduct, in upholding the . Theoretically, this could be any administrative action that can be performed by volunteers in the communities. The Foundation supports and encourages community autonomy and therefore strives to take the smallest amount of action possible, which is why it is not customary to accept community requests for said actions.

**CheckUser**

Of all admin rights, is the one most commonly used by the Foundation's Trust & Safety team, in order to help assure the trust and safety of Wikimedia communities. More often than not, it is used during the review process of emergency reports regarding against Wikimedia community members, contributors, public figures or the general public. It may also be used in response to requests for information, in line with and our , or in connection with legal disputes (for example to verify the truth of claims made by someone that is suing the Foundation) and regulatory investigations. It may sometimes be used in relation to investigation of long term abuse in consideration of a global ban as well as when issuing a global ban. Last but not least, it may be used when reviewing reports of sockpuppets suspected to be used by globally banned users, in enforcing a global ban. In any case, performing CheckUser alone does not mean/prove that the person checked has done something wrong.

It should be noted that, because of the sensitive nature of the information it may convey, CheckUser is only used when the information is pertinent in protecting the communities and broader Wikimedia movement, and only if there is no other reasonable way to obtain it. While the Foundation may share CheckUser information with highly trusted members of the community (i.e. stewards), we may opt to withhold said information if revealing it hinders ongoing efforts by law enforcement to protect the public or endangers Wikimedia community members. This action is performed through a Foundation staff account.

**Page protection**

prevents a broad range of users from editing a specific article or page. It may affect contributors with or without special permissions and we may also impose a "do not touch" rule that impacts all contributors. Foundation page protection is granted in only the rarest circumstances and typically requires a court order or a substantial risk to the trust and safety of users, staff, or the public. It is otherwise left for community mechanisms to handle, in line with .

When a page is protected under this policy, the template "`{{pp-office}}`" will be placed prominently on the page and the page will be . An article may be reduced to a few sentences to remove questionable content, and people are then invited to build it up to a more reputable state. This will be indicated by the template `{{reset}}` (or related, such as `{{pp|reset}}`) along with instructions to be followed by everyone.

**Range blocks**

are typically an action taken by the communities in order to help reduce vandalism and disruption. However, in some cases the Foundation may impose a range block in order to enforce a global ban, while upholding our .

Range blocks prevent a group of IP addresses from becoming active on the Wikimedia projects; range-blocked IPs are disabled from creating an account, editing on the projects, contacting other contributors through on-wiki features, etc.

When range blocks are placed in the course of enforcing a global ban, they are performed under the WMFOffice account. In any other situations, they are performed through a staff account.

Requesting an office action
---------------------------

A request for consideration of an office action should be placed to the Foundation team whose purview the specific action falls under. This can be the or the . While requests may initially be sent to other Foundation teams or staff and then forwarded accordingly, it is best that the request is sent directly through one of the above communication channels, to ensure speedier review.

In order for the request to be considered, it is important that it includes the following:

*   Explicitly specifies the action requested.
*   Includes a succinct summary of the reasons for the request.
*   Provides evidence (URLs) that there have already been attempts to have the issue resolved through local community governance structures where applicable and where possible.
*   Includes any crucial information and evidence in support of the request, including pertinent documentation, subject to specific action requirements as detailed under the corresponding section.

Who performs office actions?
----------------------------

Office actions are performed strictly by Foundation staff or contractors. They may be authorized by any representative or delegate of the Wikimedia Foundation - usually as directed by the Foundation's , certain members of the [Foundation office staff](https://wikimediafoundation.org/role/staff-contractors/) or as prescribed by each individual policy related to the specific office action.

The Foundation staff members usually performing office actions are:

*   .
*   Members of the with their staff user accounts.

The office actions will usually come from a role account, with the username User:WMFOffice. In some cases, like performing DMCA takedowns, office actions may be performed by one's staff account. Either way, they will be clearly indicated both during and after to prevent ambiguities.

Wikimedia administrators and others who have the technical power to revert or edit office actions are strongly cautioned against doing so. Unauthorized modifications to office actions will not only be reverted, but may lead to sanctions by the Foundation, such as revocation of the rights of the individual involved. When in doubt, community members should consult the Foundation member of staff that performed the office action, or their line manager. However, details regarding an office action are only shared to the extent that they do not compromise the safety of users, the public or the project.

Timeline of office actions
--------------------------

[![A flowchart documenting the office actions workflow](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Trust_and_Safety_Office_action_workflow.png/250px-Trust_and_Safety_Office_action_workflow.png)](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trust_and_Safety_Office_action_workflow.png)

The Office actions workflow (in English)

Each office action request is as unique as the person it regards. This applies especially to requests regarding conduct issues; content related actions tend to be more straightforward. Moreover, each action listed under this policy is subject to different internal processes; it may be the outcome of evaluation of a reported behavior rather than the evaluation happening in order to determine if a requested action is warranted.

For these reasons there is no set timeline for office actions in general. However, we do try to respond to them as soon possible and try to adhere to the following timeline guidelines:

*   Global bans: 4 weeks
*   Event bans: 4 weeks
*   DMCA compliance: 7 business days
*   Child protection: 24 hours

While we strive to adhere to the aforementioned timeline guidelines, it is possible that it takes a lot longer for an office action request to be evaluated and granted. Delays in evaluation can be caused due to receipt of additional/new information regarding the original request, the request expanding substantially during evaluation or other unforeseen circumstances.

Appeals
-------

Office Actions, or Foundation decisions _not_ to take an Office Action, can be appealed within 6 months of their first issuance or of their substantial, atypical modification (the extension of a suspension by several months, for example, does not trigger a new right to appeal) upon legal counsel approval.

Only individuals directly involved in a case may request review, either as an individual who requested the initial case or as an individual under investigation. Reviews may be requested following our decision (i.e., whether or not to take an Office Action), at the end of the investigation.

Appeals against office actions should be sent by email to appeals![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org, setting out the reason(s) why it was inappropriate.

With regards to office actions undertaken around investigations into the behavior of specific users, the volunteer has been formed to review appeals of eligible Trust & Safety office actions. More details may be found on the Trust & Safety Case Review Committee page.

General information
-------------------

It is important to help clarify a few points regarding office actions in general:

**Office actions are extremely rare.**

In comparison to actions taken throughout the Wikimedia projects, led by the local community governance mechanisms in pursuit of our vision and mission and in compliance to our , the number of office actions is very, very small.

**Office actions are preventable.**

All conduct mitigated by office actions is unwanted on a Wikimedia project in the first place; if such is observed and corrected (i.e. removed, ceased or otherwise prevented), no complaint is likely to be made as there is nothing to complain about. Similarly, if a complaint is resolved before any action is taken, it is unlikely for an office action to subsequently take place.

**Office actions are transparent when possible, but safety (and legal compliance) come first.**

It is not always possible to maintain the same level of transparency for every office action listed under this policy as, in some situations, complete or even partial transparency can compromise the right to privacy and/or safety of involved individuals or hinder ongoing police investigations. We are committed to be transparent wherever possible, but not at the risk of placing Wikimedia users, the public, or the projects in danger.

**Office actions are governed by strict internal processes.**

The lack of transparency involved in certain office actions does not remove accountability of those enforcing them; they are required to comply with internal processes and protocols and are never enforced without multi-level review and explicit approval. We will share information regarding final office actions and internal processes followed in enforcing them, whenever we can.

**Office actions are not based on personal grudges.**

They are performed only following explicit complaints to the about the content of a or certain abusive behavior taking place within or affecting the wellbeing, trust and safety of contributors in a Wikimedia project. In some cases, investigations may be prompted by Law enforcement requests or as part of our policy enforcement processes.They are also taken in line with prescribed processes and are subject to strict internal review by multiple members of staff in the Wikimedia Foundation hierarchy.

**Abusive requests are not acceptable.**

We are committed to attempt to address all valid requests for an office action submitted to us, in good faith, and through the appropriate communications channels. However, we will not consider requests themselves breaching our or or other behavioral policies, or requests accompanied by demands for preferential treatment (such as control over the article). We will not tolerate intimidation, threats of harm or any other communication that may constitute harassment towards our staff. If any of the above conduct is observed and if inappropriate reporting behavior continues after we have issued a warning, we may entirely refuse to communicate with the reporting party. The lock-out period will be determined based on the seriousness, frequency, number and - if reasonably apparent - presumed intent (e.g. apparent bad faith) of the abusive reports.

**Post-action monitoring.**

The Foundation does not generally monitor the projects for breaches to the office actions it has enforced. It relies on the Wikimedia community's help in keeping the communities safe and thriving by reporting such breaches to the Trust & Safety team, who will review them on a case-by-case basis and take appropriate actions.

**Enforcing office actions.**

Community members are welcome to but not expected or obliged to help enforce office actions. If they choose to do so on the grounds of upholding the , however, this should not be a punishable action and they should not be subject to sanctions. One can help enforce office actions in multiple ways such as reporting socks of an interaction-banned contributor using them to interact with another user, removing content uploaded by a globally banned user, informing of an event banned contributor's intent to turn up at an event they should not be attending, etc.

**Abuse of office or staff actions.**

If you think that the office actions listed under this policy have been abused, you can submit your concerns through ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org. This email address can also be used to report potential abuse by staff accounts such as inappropriate conduct or use of their advanced user rights.
