Purpose
-------

Revenue from commercial sales and contracts such as Wikimedia Enterprise helps to diversify the Wikimedia Foundation’s (the Foundation’s) financial support and financial sustainability. However, as a non-profit organization, it is important to have limits on revenue from commercial sales and contracts.

Through this policy, Wikimedia Foundation defines the basic guidelines governing revenue obtained through commercial sales and contracts to further its mission. This builds on and supersedes the principles laid out in the .

Policy
------

### Overall

This policy defines the guidelines and guardrails for the Foundation’s commercial sales and contracts, as well as those of its legal affiliates.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) These commercial sales and contracts currently include Wikimedia Enterprise (sales and royalties) and merchandise store sales.

The Foundation, as a 501(c)(3), limits commercial sales and contracts to be consistent with a non-profit organization. To that end, the Foundation is limiting revenue from commercial sales and contracts to no more than 30% of the Foundation's total revenue via all sources in a fiscal year. The Foundation and its affiliates will not seek commercial sales and contracts beyond that 30% limit.

Revenue from commercial sales and contracts will be allocated to the general fund of the Foundation.

### Commercial Sales and Contracts Requiring Board Notice

The Foundation and its affiliates shall provide the Board of Trustees with notice and the opportunity to review agreements prior to signature with revenue from commercial sales and contracts on an exception basis, including those which have circumstances in which, at the Foundation’s judgment, should be reviewed by the Board, such as a large-dollar contract amount, non-standard contract terms, reputational risk, financial exposure, or compliance issues.

In most cases, the Board will be given 7 business days to review or give feedback.

### Naming

The Wikimedia Foundation prefers to publicly acknowledge revenue sources, but customers may choose to remain anonymous, consistent with privacy principles allowing anonymous donations and anonymous re-use of Wikimedia content.

### Reporting

Revenue from commercial sales and contracts, including Wikimedia Enterprise, is reported within the Foundation’s annual audit report. Management will also present projections related to commercial sales and contracts for the coming year to the Audit Committee as part of the Audit Committee’s review of the upcoming year’s budget, as well as projections and progress of Wikimedia Enterprise revenue and expenses to the Audit Committee as part of periodic budget reviews. Revenue and expenses specifically related to Wikimedia Enterprise will be published publicly at least annually.

### Review and Updates

This policy was last updated on May 28, 2025. The policy will be reviewed every three years by the Foundation in consultation with the Audit Committee, or more frequently as needed, to consider any necessary recommendations for improvements.

Notes
