The **Combating Online Child Exploitation Policy** is a set of guidelines and regarding changes to or removals of content on the Wikimedia projects, or actions against specific individuals, performed by Foundation staff members upon receipt of one or multiple valid complaints from the volunteer community or the public, and/or as required by law.

This policy supports existing policies around user conduct, such as the , the , and the . It serves to formalize existing "unwritten" policies and similar gray areas between these policies. It also supports the Foundation's commitment to protect childrens' rights set out in our as well as recommendations made in the . All office actions are performed pursuant to the .

Purpose and scope
-----------------

The Wikimedia projects attract contributors of all backgrounds, spanning a large demographic range. Given the range, some volunteers, including minors, are inherently more at risk and potentially vulnerable to exploitation and disproportionate levels of abuse. The Wikimedia Foundation has a zero tolerance policy regarding content or activity that sexually exploits or puts minors at risk.

This policy following extensive discussion with and feedback from community, industry and subject matter experts, and Foundation staff stakeholders. It was most recently updated in October 2025. Any updates to this policy will be recorded as soon as possible, but may go into effect before the public document is changed. Questions about changes or current practice may be addressed at the talk page or emailed to ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org.

Child sexual abuse material ("CSAM")
------------------------------------

The definition of child sexual abuse material ("CSAM") across industry best practices is broad and covers a wide range of subjects and acts. Generally, CSAM refers to any content that depicts sexually explicit activities involving a child. Visual depictions include photographs, videos, live streaming, and digital or computer generated images, including AI-generated content, indistinguishable from an actual minor.

CSAM is known legally as "child pornography", though this term is generally deprecated. Additional information including definitions is available from subject matter-specific organizations including [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/news/what-child-sexual-abuse-material-csam), [the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.org/theissues/csam), and [INHOPE](https://inhope.org/EN/articles/child-sexual-abuse-material).

Material on the Wikimedia websites is intended for , which informs our definition of CSAM. It includes all forms of text or media — depictions of real people, computer generated, or illustrated. Under this policy, you must not upload material that depicts the sexual exploitation of minors — that is, people under the age of 18. This includes images of yourself.

### Prohibited content

**Prohibited content** includes (but is not limited to) photographs, drawings, renderings, or videos of minors depicting:

*   Nude body with a focus on genital areas, where that image has no obvious educational value aligned with the projects' purpose (see below for more details)
*   Implicit or explicit sexual intercourse with or in proximity of a minor

*   Simulated sexual activity (including if the minor is fully clothed)
*   Masturbation
*   A minor depicted with or engaging in sexual activity with sex toys
*   Other "sexually explicit conduct" as defined in United States law ([18 U.S. Code § 2256](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256))

Sharing links to (or purporting to be to) such material is also in violation of this policy. Other material may be removed by the Foundation at the discretion of the Legal department as a pursuant to the .

### Situations and content outside the scope of this policy

In rare cases, images that may be removed on other platforms might be kept on the Wikimedia projects as they provide educational, medical, or scientific value in support of Wikimedia's free knowledge mission.

Examples of content that _may_ be allowed on our websites includes (but is not limited to) photographs, drawings, renderings, or videos of minors depicting:

*   Media with demonstrable cultural or historic significance (for example, Phan Thi Kim Phuc / "")
*   Artistic representations of nude children with demonstrable educational value (such as, but not limited to , lolita, historical cartoons, drawings, paintings, or photographs)
*   Media from movies, television shows, or paintings/drawings from renowned artists
*   Minor with minimal clothing (e.g., swimsuits, athletic clothing) in staged or competitive environments such as notable pageants or sporting events
*   Media depicting naturist or nudist colonies in which context is demonstrably not sexual
*   Media in which scientific, medical, or religious context is evident (for example, images used on Wikipedia to illustrate a medical condition in minors)

### Reporting violations

If you come across material that you believe to be in violation of this policy, **please report it to the Wikimedia Foundation immediately**. You can send links to the material (or other links that may help us locate the material) to legal-reports![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org.

If you are a volunteer administrator, you should also feel empowered to delete or suppress the content per the editorial policies of your language version of the project. The legal-reports address is monitored by the Trust and Safety team in collaboration with the Foundation's Legal team. Material sent there will be evaluated and, if in violation of applicable policy, removed and reported as documented below.

Content that promotes, supports or encourages child exploitation
----------------------------------------------------------------

Section 4 of the , "Refraining from certain activities", prohibits "encouraging, grooming, or advocating for others to create or share \[CSAM\]". You may not post material, through text or other means, which promotes, encourages, or advocates for child sexual exploitation, or which seeks or requests abusive material. This includes but is not limited to:

These were analyzed in combination with the approaches taken by other organizations of a similar size and with websites using a similar system of community-led governance and moderation, general industry best practices, the , and input from subject-matter experts. To this end, we undertook interviews with trusted volunteer community groups with , many of whom have encountered these issues in the past. The policy was last revised in October 2025 to facilitate more consistent global standards.

### How does this policy interact with my community's policies?

There are a number of communities with explicit policies on child protection. This policy is intended to complement local policies on child protection where these exist and are enforced. Communities may create and enforce local project policies going beyond the shared minimal standards this topic-specific policy provides. Situations may also continue to be escalated to the Trust and Safety team by any community member.

### How long does it take for an action to be issued under this policy?

Cases involving CSAM uploads are handled immediately after processing a complaint. The Foundation follows statutory expectations in the United States in processing these types of issues. Other matters may vary depending on the nature of the report. Most cases take between 3–4 weeks to investigate and take action on.

### Can actions taken under this policy be appealed?

In general, actions related to content takedowns (discussed under the CSAM section above) are not appealable to the . However, if you have reported a user for potentially violating this policy and the Trust and Safety team declines to act, or takes action you believe inadequate, this can typically be appealed.

### How will this policy be modified?

What if the content I uploaded was removed under this update?
-------------------------------------------------------------

As part of the internal review process, the Foundation's Legal team reviews all removals to confirm that they comply with the relevant applicable law. If your content continues to stay removed after the legal review, it is likely that the Foundation was legally obligated to do so. Please note that the Foundation may also be in the course of appealing the Legal Order, but prohibited from reinstating the content in question unless and until it has succeeded in its appeal. If you have questions about such removal or believe that there is new information that the Foundation should consider, contact legal![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org. However, the Foundation may be limited by applicable law in disclosing the information about these requests.

Who handles Terrorist Content Notices within the Wikimedia Foundation?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Foundation receives a Legal Order that qualifies as Terrorist Content under the applicable law, the Foundation will remove the content temporarily, pending a legal review. Once the content is removed, Foundation's staff will register the takedown in the edit summary as a response to the Legal Order. Unless otherwise required by the Legal Order, the Foundation shall take necessary steps to inform the contributor about the takedown.

Timeline for Terrorist Content Notice of Action
-----------------------------------------------

Each Terrorist Content Notice will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Whenever possible, the Foundation strives to review the Terrorist Content Notices within one business day. In emergency cases where the Legal Order requires expedited removal, the Foundation shall review and take the necessary action as soon as possible.
