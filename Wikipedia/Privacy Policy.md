Introduction
------------

### Welcome!

The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like , , and .

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information.

*   We collect very little Personal Information about you.
*   We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties.

By using Wikimedia Sites, you confirm that you have read and understood this Policy.

The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that when you use any of the Wikimedia Sites, we collect, transfer, process, store, disclose, and use your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.

After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.

#### Definitions

We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy.

Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our helpful.

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy.

#### What This Privacy Policy Does and Does Not Cover

Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of any of the Wikimedia Sites. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.

| Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers |
| --- |
| For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:<br><br>*   All of our major sites (found at ), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.<br>*   Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).<br>*   Official Wikimedia Foundation mobile applications.<br>*   Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you. |

This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may gather or process information. For example, some uses may be covered by separate privacy policies (like those of the [Wikimedia Shop](https://shop.wikimedia.org/)) or sites or services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on [Wikimedia Cloud Services](https://labs.wikimedia.org/)). To understand more about what this Privacy Policy does not cover, please see below.

| More on what the Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy does not cover |
| --- |
| This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.<br><br>Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies<br><br>Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:<br><br>*   **Wikipedia Store** (covered by [the shop's policy](https://store.wikimedia.org/pages/copy-of-privacy-policy));<br>*   **donate.wikimedia.org**, including the donation process, such as clicking on a donation banner (covered by ); and<br>*   **The** , which is governed by a separate . This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.<br><br>If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy.

This global community of volunteers may sometimes have access to personal Information in order to ensure the functioning of the Wikimedia Sites.<br><br>*   **Administrative volunteers**, such as or . These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our , as well as other, tool-specific policies.<br>*   **Tool providers**. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as . When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.<br>*   **Other users**. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:<br>    *   posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;<br>    *   requesting support from volunteers through our (email sent to info![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org goes to this system);<br>    *   emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and<br>    *   chatting on (such as on the #wikipedia channel).<br><br>Third parties<br><br>This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties.

They are governed by their own privacy policies.<br><br>Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org so we can investigate. |

Collection & Use of Info
------------------------

### Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It

#### Your Public Contributions

Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your temporary account username (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the ["How We Use Information We Receive From You"](#infowereceive) section of this Privacy Policy.

| Publicly Visible Information |
| --- |
| Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.<br><br>You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender. |

#### Account Information & Registration

You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example).

If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your temporary account.

Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under . However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to a associated with your browser.

If you want to create a , in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.

| More on Usernames |
| --- |
| Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.<br><br>Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects. |

To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

#### Location Information

##### GPS & Other Location Technologies

Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.

If you consent, we can use (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our .

##### Metadata

Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive , such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

##### IP Addresses

Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the of the device (or your ) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to .

### Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites

We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.

We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.

#### Information We Receive Automatically

Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your , your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's , in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.

Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.

#### Information We Collect

We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include:

*   , which is used to enhance the security of our sites, provide analytic data, deliver our services, and ensure site reliability,
*   , which are used to enhance the security of our sites and to deliver our services,
*   , which are used to deliver our services as requested and for analytic purposes, and
*   A variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as and session storage, which are used to deliver our services as requested.

These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your ), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at [privacy@wikimedia.org](mailto:privacy@wikimedia.org).

| More on Locally Stored Data |
| --- |
| Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:<br><br>*   Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.<br>*   Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.<br>*   Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.<br>*   Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.<br>*   Make the Wikimedia Sites more functional and convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in, to maintain your temporary account session when you edit logged out, or to remember your username in the login field. |

Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our .

We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our . While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.

While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

### Other

#### Location information

##### GPS & Other Location Technologies

As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.

##### Metadata

As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

##### IP Addresses

When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."

Sharing
-------

### When May We Share Your Information?

We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.

#### With Your Permission

We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our .

#### For Legal Reasons

We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our . We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

For more information, see our .

#### If the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!)

In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on [WikimediaAnnounce-L](https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikimediaannounce-l) or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

#### To Protect You, Ourselves & Others

We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to:

*   enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;
*   protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
*   prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.

We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our , this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our or similarly protective agreements. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our for more information.)

#### To Our Service Providers

We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. The privacy policies of some of these third-party service providers or contractors can be found on our page. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our .

If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found .

#### To Understand & Experiment

*   We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.
*   We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.
*   When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest.

The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.

Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our .)

#### Because You Made It Public

Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone.

Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering, logging into your account, or using a temporary account, then your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.

Protection
----------

### How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?

We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.

### How Long Do We Keep Your Data?

Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law.

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our .)

Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your temporary account username (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our .

### Your rights

If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our . If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may . We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

As stated in our , Wikimedia believes strongly in the values of privacy and transparency. To that end, we have created this Cookie Statement as a clear reference guide to the use of cookies on Wikimedia Sites. This Cookie Statement explains how we use cookies (and other locally stored data technologies), how we use third-party cookies, and how you can manage your cookie options. For more information on our privacy practices, please visit our .

The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, actively collects some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include , , and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as and .

What is a cookie?
-----------------

A "cookie" is a tiny data file that we transfer onto your computer, mobile phone, or any other device that you use to access the Wikimedia Sites, and is generally used for authentication and tracking.

What types of cookies does Wikimedia use and for what purposes?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Cookies are not required in order to read or edit the Wikimedia Sites. We use the information we receive from cookies and other locally stored data technologies to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and interactions with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. Cookies are required in order to login and for your edits to be associated with a user account; without cookies, your edits will be unassociated with a standard account.

We use cookies, JavaScript, tracking pixels, and other locally stored data technologies to accomplish different purposes. Below is a list of the categories of cookies we use and what they are used for.

**Functionality:**

These cookies help the Wikimedia Sites work and are essential in order to enable you to move around the Wikimedia site and use their features. These cookies are useful for remembering your username in the login field, maintaining your session and remembering previous actions, keeping you logged in (if selected), and more.

Here are a few examples:

| Name | Expires | Category | What does it do? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| centralauth\_Token<br><br>{$wgCookiePrefix}\* Token | 365 days, if the user chooses 'Keep me logged in' or 90 days if the user edits using a temporary account. Otherwise omitted. | Functionality | Provides 'Keep me logged in' functionality (if editing from a standard account) or temporary account functionality (if editing without logging in). |
| {$wgCookiePrefix}\* UserID, UserName | 365 days, if the user chooses 'Keep me logged in' or 90 days if the user edits using a temporary account. Otherwise 30 days. | Functionality | Helps identify you to the wiki, and keeps you logged in. |
| loginnotify\_prevlogins | 180 days | Functionality | Verifies that you are logging in from a known device.<br><br>This affects the threshold for how many unsuccessful login attempts trigger a notification to the user. |

**Third-Party:**

We will never use third-party cookies on our wikis unless we get your permission to do so. These cookies would allow us to render services provided by third parties, such as "like" and "share" buttons. When a third party provides these kinds of services, they may require the use of a cookie in order to provide their services.

If you ever come across a third-party cookie transferred to your device during your access of the Wikimedia wiki sites, where you did not take any action to authorize the use and/or transfer of that cookie  (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report that cookie to us at privacy![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org.

**A note about Wikimedia Foundation non-wiki sites:**

Some non-wiki Wikimedia Foundation sites are hosted by a third-party service provider.

Sites hosted by WordPress VIP may have the WordPress Stats module enabled. Stats is a service that allows us to understand how many visitors we get to our WordPress-hosted non-wiki sites, their location by country, and which pages, posts and links are the most popular. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider, Automattic/WordPress, have access to the raw Stats data, which is retained for a maximum of 30 days. For more information about Stats, see WordPress' [support page on the module](https://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/).

Sites hosted by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc., known as Discourse forums, use cookies for functionality purposes and to store preferences. Only the Wikimedia Foundation and the service provider have access to the raw data. For more information about the cookies and their retention periods, see Discourse's [information about cookies](https://www.discourse.org/privacy#heading--cookies). Please note that the Wikimedia Foundation has not configured its Discourse forums to use Google Analytics, serve advertisements, or process donations; Discourse cookies related to those purposes are not used in our Sites.

What are my cookie options?
---------------------------

While this is not a comprehensive list, below are some of the things that you can do to limit use of cookies and other locally stored data technologies on your device. While cookies and other locally stored data technologies may not be necessary to use our sites, some features may not function properly if you disable them.

You can:

*   remove or disable specific locally stored data on your browser's settings (you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent);
*   use a browser that can block third-party cookies; or
*   install a plug-in to block locally stored data, if one is available.

Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent tracking pixels from tracking your specific activity. A tracking pixel may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your browser-based email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.

Where can I find more information?

[translate](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate/page-Policy:Wikimedia_Foundation_Access_to_Nonpublic_Personal_Data_Policy/Summary&language=en&action=page)

This is a user-friendly summary of the access to nonpublic personal data policy.

Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of the access to nonpublic personal data policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding the full access to nonpublic personal data policy. Think of it as the user-friendly interface.

**Because we believe that the privacy of the Wikimedia community is essential, community members with access to nonpublic personal data may only release information under certain circumstances, such as:**

*   When the community members need to stop damage to the Wikimedia Sites (such as );
*   When there is an immediate and credible ;
*   When the community members have the of the user whose nonpublic personal data is to be disclosed; or
*   When .

**Because we believe that safeguarding the privacy of the Wikimedia community is an important Wikimedia value, those who have access to nonpublic personal data need to:**

*   Be at least (except email response team members, who must be at least 16 years old);
*   Provide ; and
*   Sign a .

**Because we value the community members who take on this critical role in the safeguarding of the Wikimedia Sites and its users and want to protect their privacy, we promise to:**

*   Keep their contact information and confidentiality agreement

Purpose
-------

(the "Sites") are the product of a global community of volunteer contributors and editors. This dedicated group of individuals not only writes and curates content on the Sites, they also help ensure the safety of the Sites and its users as well as compliance with applicable policies. To manage this immense task effectively, certain community members are entrusted with access to limited amounts of nonpublic personal information regarding other users ("Nonpublic Personal Data"). For example, a community member who has "checkuser" rights could use those rights to investigate whether a single user is using multiple accounts in a manner inconsistent with Wikimedia policies. The purpose of this "Access to Nonpublic Personal Data Information" policy (the "Policy") is to:

*   explain the minimum requirements that must be met by any community member who has access to Nonpublic Personal Data;
*   explain the rights and responsibilities of community members with access to Nonpublic Personal Data;
*   ensure that community members with access to Nonpublic Personal Data understand and commit to maintaining the confidentiality of Nonpublic Personal Data; and
*   provide guidelines to community members with access to Nonpublic Personal Data as to when they may access Nonpublic Personal Data, how they may use such information, and when and to whom they may disclose such information.

Community members covered by this Policy
----------------------------------------

This Policy applies to any community member to whom the has granted access to Nonpublic Personal Data covered by the ("Designated Community Member"), including:

*   Community members with access to any tool that permits them to view Nonpublic Personal Data about other users (such as the CheckUser tool) or members of the public (for example, through VRTS accounts);
*   Community members with the ability to access content or Nonpublic Personal Data which has been removed from administrator view (such as the Suppression tool); and
*   Volunteer developers with access to Nonpublic Personal Data.

For illustrative purposes only, some examples of Designated Community Members include: , , and . This Policy does not apply to users whose rights only include the ability to view standard deleted revisions. This Policy also does not apply to Wikimedia Foundation employees or contractors who act in their professional capacity because they are already subject to other confidentiality agreements that are as or more protective than this Policy.

**Exceptions.** The Wikimedia Foundation may, at its sole discretion, provide Nonpublic Personal Data to groups of community members who are not covered by this Policy and to groups of Designated Community Members under terms outside of this Policy (“exceptions”). Such exceptions must be reviewed by the Wikimedia Foundation’s Legal department; are listed publicly. In individual cases, "exemptions" may be granted to users who would otherwise be unable to be granted NDA status due to or in a jurisdiction that blocks access to Wikimedia projects. Such individual exemptions must also be reviewed by the Legal department, but approved exemptions are not listed publicly in consideration of community member privacy.

Minimum requirements for Designated Community Members applying for access to nonpublic information rights
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following conditions are minimum requirements that all Designated Community Members must meet before being granted access to Nonpublic Personal Data ("access rights"). These conditions should also be considered requirements to be a candidate for any community-run selection process for a role that would convey such access rights. The community may require candidates for access rights to meet additional community-specified criteria on a case-by-case or role-by-role basis.

**(a) Minimum age.** Access to nonpublic information requires maturity because of the significant responsibilities that come along with confidentiality obligations. For this reason, any community member who applies for access rights must:

*   be at least eighteen (18) years of age, except email response team members who must be at least sixteen (16) years of age; and
*   must certify to the Wikimedia Foundation that they meet the minimum age required for the rights they are applying for.

**(b) Valid, linked email address.** In order to ensure that we can contact the individuals who take on these important roles, any community member who applies for access rights must:

*   submit to the Wikimedia Foundation a valid email address;
*   have the account under which they are applying for rights linked to a valid email address;
*   complete verification of the submitted and/or linked email address (such as responding to a confirmation email sent to their submitted email address), if requested to do so; and
*   inform the Wikimedia Foundation of any change to their email address within one week of such change.

**(c) Confidentiality.** To ensure that community members with access rights understand and commit to keeping the Nonpublic Personal Data confidential, they will be required to read and certify that they agree to a short that outlines:

*   what Designated Community Members should treat as confidential information;
*   when they are allowed to access Nonpublic Personal Data;
*   how Designated Community Members may use Nonpublic Personal Data about other users;
*   when and to whom they may disclose the Nonpublic Personal Data and how they must otherwise refrain from disclosing Nonpublic Personal Data to anyone, except as permitted under applicable policies;
*   how they must safeguard their accounts from unauthorized access; and
*   when they must report disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Data to third parties or improper access, use, or disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Data.

**(d) Privacy.** In consideration of the privacy of Designated Community Members, any personal information submitted by Designated Community Members to the Wikimedia Foundation as part of their application process or otherwise under this Policy is subject to the Wikimedia Foundation's and .

**(e) Submission timeline.** Any community member who has been granted access rights at the time this Policy becomes effective must meet the requirements of Sections (a) – (c) of this Policy within ninety (90) calendar days of the date this Policy becomes effective. The Wikimedia Foundation may, at its sole discretion, extend the compliance period for individual community members as needed.

Any community member who has not met the requirements of Section (a) – (c) of this Policy by the deadline above should anticipate having their access rights revoked until they have submitted the required information.

Use and disclosure of nonpublic information
-------------------------------------------

Designated Community Members provide valuable services to the Sites and its users – they fight vandalism, respond to helpdesk emails, ensure that improperly disclosed private data is removed from public view, confirm license permissions, investigate sockpuppets, improve and debug software, and much more. But Designated Community Members' use of access rights is limited to certain circumstances and contexts. This section elucidates the situations in which access rights may be used and Nonpublic Personal Data may be disclosed to third parties.

**(a) Use of access rights and Nonpublic Personal Data.** All Designated Community Members may only use their access rights and the subsequent information they access in accordance with the policies that govern the tools they use to gain such access. For example, community members with access to the CheckUser tool must comply with the global , and, unless they are performing a cross-wiki check, they must also comply with the more restrictive applicable to the relevant Site. Similarly, community members with access to the Suppression tool may only use the tool in accordance with the . When a Designated Community Member's access to a certain tool is revoked, for any reason, that member must destroy all Nonpublic Personal Data that they have as a result of that tool.

**(b) Disclosure of nonpublic information.** In the course of keeping the Sites and its users safe, Designated Community Members must sometimes disclose Nonpublic Personal Data to third parties. Disclosures of Nonpublic Personal Data are limited to:

(i) other Designated Community Members with the same access rights, or who otherwise are permitted to access the same Nonpublic Personal Data, to fulfill the duties outlined in the applicable policy for the access tool used;

(iii) law enforcement, in cases where there is an immediate and credible threat of serious bodily harm;

(iv) authorized parties, with the express permission of the user whose nonpublic information is to be disclosed;

(v) the public, when it is a necessary and incidental consequence of a Designated Community Member blocking a sockpuppet or other abusive account; or

(vi) when authorized by the Wikimedia Foundation's Legal Department through an .

While Designated Community Members may disclose Nonpublic Personal Data to third parties under the circumstances described above, they are under no obligation by the Foundation to do so. Please note, however, if a Designated Community Member chooses to disclose in a situation covered by (ii), or (iv), or if they are required by law to disclose to law enforcement, administrative bodies, or other governmental agencies, they must secure written approval from the Wikimedia Foundation by emailing `check-disclosure![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org` an explanation of the proposed disclosure at least ten (10) business days prior to such anticipated disclosure.

In the event that a Designated Community Member receives a request for Personal Data from law enforcement regarding an immediate and credible threat of bodily harm, as described above in (iii), and the Designated Community Member chooses to disclose Personal Data, they are permitted to do so without pre-authorization however that Designated Community Member should immediately contact `check-disclosure![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org` with an explanation of the disclosure. If the Designated Community Member chooses not to disclose Personal Data in response to an emergency request from law enforcement, that Designated Community Member should immediately email `emergency![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org` with details of the request so that it can be evaluated for possible Foundation disclosure.

All other formal and informal requests for user Nonpublic Personal Data (i.e. those not covered by one of the situations described above or those not acted upon by a community member with access rights), including subpoenas, from law enforcement, government agencies, attorneys, or other third parties should be directed to the Wikimedia Foundation's legal department at `legal![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org`.

Violations
----------

Complaints about infringements of this Policy may be submitted to the . Breaches may result in conduct warnings or removal of advanced rights. Consistent with the , the Foundation may take such actions with or without recommendation from the Ombuds Commission, but barring extraordinary circumstances the Foundation will generally defer to appropriate community governance mechanisms for enforcement rather than take direct action.

Complaints about inappropriate actions taken under an should be evaluated by the appropriate community governance mechanisms. Complaints may also be for review under the . If a complaint concerns the Privacy Policy's , then the Ombuds Commission may also review.

Complaints about Designated Community Members infringing confidentiality obligations or expectations that exist outside of this Policy and its exceptions should be evaluated by the appropriate community governance mechanisms. While the Foundation may not be a party to those confidentiality agreements or expectations, major breaches of community trust may result in loss of the Foundation's trust through application of the .

This is a summary of the policy. To read the full terms, scroll down.

Disclaimer: This summary is not a part of policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference.

**The IP addresses of temporary accounts are not made publicly available. However, certain users need access to enforce or discover potential violations of Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. To do this, these users may:**

*   temporary account IP addresses.
*   connections between associated temporary accounts when needed.
*   temporary account IP addresses when needed.

**Those with access to temporary account IP addresses, bear in mind:**

*   A non-public log details when you .
*   You will not for mistakenly revealing an IP address; grounds for removing access are if there is a repeated pattern or intentional misuse, or local community consensus.
*   If you are blocked sitewide from editing a Wikimedia project, you will to temporary account IP addresses on that project.
*   If you have a role that needs persistent and efficient access to IPs, you may have the ability to enable "auto-reveal" to automatically of temporary accounts.

**Access to the IP addresses of temporary accounts** helps users protect the Wikimedia projects. This access is separate from access to the . As a condition of access, users who have not agreed to the must agree to the following guidelines.

Background
----------

Wikimedia projects are the collaborative product of a global community of volunteer users. The projects can be edited with or without logging into a Wikimedia account. Those who edit without logging into a Wikimedia account do so using a temporary account, which does not have log-in credentials.

Purpose
-------

The Wikimedia Foundation gives certain logged-in users access to the IP addresses of temporary accounts to enable these users to enforce or investigate potential violations of Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. Access is used to fight vandalism and spamming, to check for sockpuppet abuse, and to limit disruption to Wikimedia projects.

Use and disclosure of temporary account IP addresses
----------------------------------------------------

Access to the IP addresses of logged-out editors is restricted by policy. This ensures the information is only used for anti-abuse workflows on the Wikimedia projects. Users who have access to IP addresses must not share them with someone who does not have the same access permissions unless disclosure is permissible as per guidelines below.

Outside actors who may want to access IP addresses could contact users who have this right in an attempt to obtain this information. Users with IP access privileges should be aware of this, and alert to the possibility of suspicious access requests.

### Use of temporary account IP addresses

Use of temporary account IP addresses is solely for the investigation and discovery of, or enforcement against, vandalism, abuse, spam, harassment, disruptive behavior, and other violations of Wikimedia Foundation or community policies. Use of the IP auto-reveal mode by users who regularly view temporary account IP addresses in the course of investigations and enforcement is permissible, as long as any automatically revealed IP addresses are used solely for the purposes described above.

Access should not be used for political control, to apply pressure on editors, or as a threat against another editor in a content dispute. Note that using multiple temporary accounts is not forbidden, so long as they are not used in violation of policies (an example of a violation includes to evade blocks or bans).

Those with access to temporary account IP addresses are able to determine from which IP addresses a temporary account has performed edits or logged actions on a Wikimedia wiki. This information is only stored for a short period (currently 90 days), so IP addresses used prior to that will not be shown. The IP addresses are accessible by clicking "Show IP" on log, history, and recent changes pages. The IP addresses are also available through the IP Information tool.

The following actions are :

*   Accepting the preference that enables or disables IP reveal.
*   Revealing an IP address of a temporary account.
*   Enabling or disabling the IP auto-reveal mode.
*   Listing the temporary accounts that are associated with an IP address or CIDR range.

Access to temporary account IP addresses should be in compliance with these guidelines, the , and more restrictive local policies applicable to the relevant project.

### Disclosure

Even if a user is violating policy, avoid revealing personal information if possible. Use temporary account usernames rather than disclosing IP addresses directly, or give information such as same network/not same network or similar.

In the course of keeping the projects and other users safe, users may still need to disclose temporary account IP addresses to third parties. Permissible disclosures are limited to the following circumstances:

*   Users with access to temporary account IP addresses may privately disclose the IP addresses to other users who have the same access rights. To check if a user has access, please confirm using the .
*   Associations between temporary accounts may be made publicly when reasonably believed to be necessary, even if based on nonpublic information. However, public disclosures of associations between temporary accounts and standard accounts may not be based on nonpublic information due to differing access policies. Public disclosures of associations based on behavioral evidence are permissible.
*   When a user with access to temporary account IP addresses blocks, unblocks, or performs other administrative actions, such users may make implied disclosures of connections between temporary accounts and their associated IP addresses, such as by issuing consecutive blocks. However, such users may not explicitly connect temporary accounts and their associated IP addresses except as permitted by this policy; for example, direct disclosures in the block reason field are not permitted.
*   When it is reasonably believed to be necessary, users with access to temporary account IP addresses may also disclose the IP addresses in appropriate venues that enable them to enforce or investigate potential violations of our , the Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. Appropriate venues for such disclosures include public pages dedicated to and . If such a disclosure is later shown to have been unnecessary or mistaken, then the IP address should be promptly removed from the page text and revision-deletion considered.
*   Users who have agreed to the separate may also disclose temporary account IP addresses as permitted under that policy.

If temporary account IP addresses need to be disclosed in connection to a , immediately email emergency![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org with details of the request so that it can be evaluated for possible Foundation disclosure.

Users can report any formal and informal requests they receive that do not fall under the authorized scope of this policy, including subpoenas from law enforcement, government agencies, attorneys, or other third parties, to the Wikimedia Foundation's legal department at legal![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org.

Minimum requirements for access
-------------------------------

Access is available only to logged-in users. To gain access, users must fulfill the requirements applicable to their user group, which are outlined below. Users who qualify for both global access and local access, need only meet the requirements associated with global access. The IP reveal right cannot be bundled with user rights given to user groups that are not listed, users who are members of groups that are not listed may gain access through fulfilling the requirements set for [other users](#Other_users).

### Global access

Members of certain global user groups and certain local user groups require access to temporary account IP addresses across all Wikimedia projects in order to perform their roles. Requirements for access depend on the user group. Users who are members of more than one of the below user groups only need to fulfill the requirements of one of their user groups. For example, a member of both the Ombuds and Abuse filter maintainers user groups will receive automatic access through the Ombuds requirements; such a user's access would still be for both roles.

#### Stewards, Ombuds, U4C, and Staff

Access is automatically granted to users who are members of any of the following global user groups: , , , and Staff. Stewards, Ombuds, and U4C members are expected to treat the IP addresses consistent with these guidelines and the . Staff are expected to treat the IP addresses consistent with their NDA.

#### Global sysops, Global rollbackers, and Abuse filter maintainers and helpers

Members of the , , , and user groups may opt-in globally through . These users must then agree to use the IP addresses in accordance with these guidelines, solely for the investigation or prevention of vandalism, abuse, or other violations of Wikimedia Foundation or community policies. Alternatively, these users may choose not to opt-in globally; global access will then not be granted so long as the users are not also members of global user groups that have automatic access.

#### CheckUsers and Oversighters

Users who are members of local or user groups may opt-in globally through . These users are expected to treat the IP addresses consistent with these guidelines and the .

### Local access

Certain users require access to temporary account IP addresses on individual "local" Wikimedia projects in order to protect those projects. Requirements for access depend on the local user group. Users who are members of more than one of the below user groups only need to fulfill the requirements of one of their user groups. For example, a member of both the local CheckUsers and Bureaucrats user groups will receive automatic access through the CheckUsers requirements; such a user's access would still be for both roles.

#### CheckUsers and Oversighters

Local access is automatically granted to users who are members of the local or user groups. These users are expected to treat the IP addresses consistent with these guidelines and the .

#### Administrators and Bureaucrats

Local and may opt-in through on the local project and agree to use the IP addresses in accordance with these guidelines, solely for the investigation or prevention of vandalism, abuse, or other violations of Wikimedia Foundation or community policies. Alternatively, these users may choose not to opt-in; access will then not be granted so long as the users are not also members of user groups that have automatic access.

#### Other users

Users who are not a member of one of the above groups may nonetheless need access to the IP addresses of temporary accounts to assist in , investigations, or other work to protect Wikimedia projects.

To access temporary account IP addresses, these users must:

1.  Meet all of the following general requirements:
    1.  User account is a minimum of 6 months old, and
    2.  User account has made a minimum of 300 edits to the local project.
2.  Submit an access request to local administrators, bureaucrats where local consensus dictates,[\[Note 1\]](#cite_note-access-request-1) or stewards. There may be additional requirements as part of this review.[\[Note 2\]](#cite_note-additional_requirements-2)
3.  Opt-in through on the local project, and
4.  Agree to use the IP addresses in accordance with these guidelines, solely for the investigation or prevention of vandalism, abuse, or other violations of Wikimedia Foundation or community policies, and understand the risks and responsibilities associated with this privilege.

In order to maintain access to the IP addresses of temporary accounts, users in this category must edit or take a logged action[\[Note 3\]](#cite_note-logged_action-3) to the local project at least once within a 365-day period.

##### Exceptions to minimum requirements

If a user account does not meet the criteria above, but still has a legitimate reason to access temporary account IP addresses, for a purpose that cannot be reasonably addressed by users who already have this access, stewards are authorized to grant exceptions to the above criteria.

Removing access
---------------

An unnecessary or mistaken use or disclosure of temporary account IP addresses on its own is not grounds for removing the user right; a repeated pattern, intentional misuse, or local community consensus should be shown for removal. Users who are sitewide blocked from editing a Wikimedia project will lose access to temporary account IP addresses on that project.

Members of a user group with automatic access who do not wish to have these access privileges should contact ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org.  are authorized to remove access rights for a user with automatic access if the user is determined to have repeatedly or intentionally misused the temporary account IP addresses or local community consensus dictates removal.

[Other users](#Other_users) who have been given the user right manually may voluntarily give up their access at any time by visiting . This action is logged. If a user given the user right manually is determined to have repeatedly or intentionally misused temporary account IP addresses, or local community consensus dictates removal, then the users authorized to grant the right are also authorized to remove the right.

Requests for stewards to remove or amend access to temporary account IP addresses may be placed on . When there is community consensus regarding revocation of a user's access rights, a link to the discussion must be provided.

If necessary, requests for review by staff can be made through ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org, and user access rights removed in line with the . Complaints about infringements of the  will be escalated for review by the .

To ensure accountability, a log is kept of which users have access to temporary account IP addresses.

The right to privacy is at the core of how communities contribute to Wikimedia projects — upholding this right is a central aspect of WMF’s . These data collection guidelines outline best practices at the Wikimedia Foundation for managing privacy risk in data collection. They complement WMF’s and , providing guidance about how to handle potentially sensitive data through the entirety of its life cycle at WMF. Taken together, these guidelines contribute to our commitment to protect users' data as elaborated in our .

The breadth of what constitutes data collection can vary widely as many teams at the Foundation engage in some kind of data collection behavior. To provide guidance in meaningfully evaluating a potential data collection activity, we primarily look to understand information pertaining to five general categories:

*   Data subjects (e.g. readers, editors, app users, donors)
*   Data senders (e.g. WMF tools like a browser, app, or extension; or third-party software providers)
*   Data recipients (e.g. WMF, WME, affiliates, third-party software providers, the public)
*   Type of data (e.g. user account information, page information, telemetry data, demographic information, attitudinal or behavioral information, geographic information, event information)
*   Data usage and changes to data usage (e.g. published in raw format, published anonymously, not published; de-identified, aggregated, and kept in perpetuity)

The following Data Collection Risk Tiering Grid presents those categories as criteria to help staff assess the risk tier of their data collection activity.

Recurring or changes to existing data collection activities
-----------------------------------------------------------

If a data collection activity is _recurring_,[\[8\]](#cite_note-recurring-8) subsequent reviews will be of a **known risk**, and will require less stringent review standards. For example:

*   A high risk one-off survey in the first quarter would be deemed a known high risk (faster response and decision cadence) in later quarters if the information collected is the same.
*   A medium risk ongoing data collection activity on iOS would be deemed a known medium risk (only requiring entry into the log form) if an identical schema had already been reviewed for Android.

Proposed changes to existing ongoing data collection activities should be considered to involve a change in the type of data collected, and should be considered a new entry in the data collection activity log form/a new data collection to review.

Mitigations
-----------

Here are a list of example mitigation measures you can take to lower the risk of your data collection activity:

*   Because it is trivially easy for a bad actor to derive granular geographic data from a full IP address, for the purposes of these guidelines, collecting complete versions of IP addresses are considered to be both a unique identifier[\[3\]](#cite_note-unique_id-3) and to leak granular geographic data — therefore, collecting IP address is a medium risk data collection activity. Relevant mitigations include:
    *   dropping the last two octets of IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx)
    *   hashing IP address + user-agent (similarly to actor signature)
*   For circumstances in which granular geographic data is critical, consider collecting sub-national geographic data and then dropping all unique IDs.
*   To collect riskier unique IDs (like IP address) and maintain a low-risk status, it may be necessary to hash them.

Definitions
-----------

1.  [↑](#cite_ref-personal_info_1-0) _**Personal information**_: (from the ): Information you provide us or information we collect that could be used to personally identify you. To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following to be "personal information" if it is otherwise nonpublic and can be used to identify you:
    
    1.  your real name, address, phone number, email address, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP address, user-agent information, payment account number;
    2.  when associated with one of the items in subsection (1), any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion.
    
2.  [↑](#cite_ref-long_term_2-0) _**Long-term viewing history data**_: Data that logs pageview histories >90 days for logged-out users or >1 pageview for logged-in users.
3.  ↑ [3.0](#cite_ref-unique_id_3-0) [3.1](#cite_ref-unique_id_3-1) [3.2](#cite_ref-unique_id_3-2) _**Unique identifier (ID)**_: An expansion of "Personal Information" as defined in the WMF . To this list we add username/user ID, and app install ID. Hashed versions of plaintext unique IDs are still considered to be unique IDs, since they may still uniquely identify a user.
4.  [↑](#cite_ref-granular_geo_4-0) _**Granular geographic data**_: Data that identifies the location of a user at a sub-national resolution.
5.  [↑](#cite_ref-sensitive_data_5-0) _**Sensitive data**_: (from the ): date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital or familial status, medical conditions or disabilities, political affiliation, and religion.
6.  ↑ [6.0](#cite_ref-ongoing_6-0) [6.1](#cite_ref-ongoing_6-1) [6.2](#cite_ref-ongoing_6-2) _**Ongoing data collection**_: Data collected in an ongoing manner, typically through automated means. This covers telemetry data from app/web interactions. Importantly, it is data collected through implicit consent just by using WMF projects. It can be long term (for monitoring usage over an indefinite amount of time) or short term (for conducting experiments that have a definite end).

The right to privacy is at the core of how communities contribute to Wikimedia projects and upholding this right is central to our . These data publication guidelines are the best practices at the Wikimedia Foundation for managing risk in data publication. They complement our and contribute to our commitment to protect users' data as elaborated in our .

Similar guidelines pertaining to data collection are forthcoming, in order to more fully govern the entire lifecycle of data in Wikimedia Foundation systems.

### Frequently asked questions

*   **Q: What is the Risk Tiering Grid used for?** The Risk Tiering Grid is to help Wikimedia Foundation teams that work with data know when their work requires privacy review by Legal and Security.
*   **Q: What are the key risks the Tiering Grid measures?** The key risks are on both the overuse and underuse of the spectrum. If this is used in such a way that too many things are being triaged to Legal and Security, then Legal and Security become the bottleneck for necessary workflow. On the other hand, if projects go live that would have been halted or mitigated under privacy review, that exposes the Foundation to privacy risks — including reputational, legal, and security risks.
*   **Q: Who are the intended audiences of the Tiering Grid?** Teams that work with data in product and tech.
*   **Q: What is changed from the existing risk review process?** The existing review process required every single schema and data project to undergo Legal review. This both was not being followed, and was not practical to follow for either data teams or Legal.
*   **Q: What is the process for updating the Tiering Grid or resolving Tiering disagreements?**
    *   Get Privacy approval
    *   Anyone can initiate an update/amendment but approval must be sought across the board before implementing
    *   Ongoing feedback immediately following launch, regular recalibration thereafter (say, every quarter or half)
*   **Q: What should I do if I am unsure whether to reach out to the Legal and Security teams?** When in doubt, it is better to err on the side of caution and submit a [L3SC request](https://office.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal,_Safety_%26_Security_Service_Center).

### Threshold table

Use this table to determine whether your analysis is _**granular**_ or _**high-level**_, informing which tier/risk level the analysis is considered as. Note: thresholds are determined based solely on the statistics being released — i.e. if you are only releasing information about edits, you do not need to account for how many editors generated the edits.

| **Data unit type** | **Classification of analysis based on counts** |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **"Granular"** | **"High-level"** |
| **Users (including unique devices)** | <25 | ≥25 |
| **Edits** | <50 | ≥50 |
| **App interactions** | <100 | ≥100 |
| **Views** | <250 | ≥250 |

For reverts, report rate and a rough total if the reverted edit count or total edit count are less than the threshold. For example:

*   If 8 out of 49 edits were reverted:
    *   "16.3% reverted (out of <50 edits)"
*   If 49 out of 49 edits were reverted:
    *   "100% reverted (out of <50 edits)"
*   If 20 out of 580 edits were reverted:
    *   "3.4% reverted (out of ~600 edits)"
    *   "3.4% reverted (out of >500 edits)"
*   If 50 out of 50 edits were reverted:
    *   OK to leave as-is (both counts meet threshold)

This guidance also applies to reporting below-threshold percentages for other data types.

Publication risk mitigation checklist
-------------------------------------

This self-service checklist is intended to help data scientists and analysts lower the risk of a high or medium risk data publication and reduce unintentional disclosures of private information.

Before you post data publicly (which includes pushing a notebook to gerrit or gitlab), have you

*   entered this data publication into the [data publication log form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds6m1puVoWHUoeYOq-4IoVg81aqrdkuQjWX8BZTrTjdBh5Fg/viewform)?
*   cleared outputs that display raw data?
*   cleared outputs that display granular data (as defined in the threshold table above)?
*   obfuscated rows that display granular data? For example:

| Python | R   |
| --- | --- |
| \# imagine we are doing an analysis of the number of \*users\* to try a feature<br><br>\# set constants<br>threshold \= 25<br>col \= "num\_users"<br><br>\# obfuscate rows<br>df.loc\[df\[col\] < threshold, col\] \= f'<{threshold}' | library(tidyverse)<br>library(glue)<br><br>\# {{tunit\|69\|set constants}}<br>threshold <- 25<br><br>df <- df \|><br>  mutate(num\_users \= ifelse(num\_users < threshold, glue("<{threshold}"), num\_users)) |

*   filtered out rows that display granular data? For example:

| Python | R   |
| --- | --- |
| \# imagine we are doing an analysis of \*app interactions\* on the users did<br><br>\# {{tunit\|69\|set constants}}<br>threshold \= 100<br>col \= "num\_interactions"<br><br>\# filter out rows below threshold<br>df \= df\[df\[col\] \>= threshold\] | library(tidyverse)<br><br>\# {{tunit\|69\|set constants}}<br>threshold <- 100<br><br>df <- df \|><br>  filter(num\_interactions \>= threshold) |

General risk heuristics
-----------------------

_Below, "X > Y > Z" means that X is riskier than Y, which is in turn riskier than Z._

*   Data type:
    *   Geography:
        *   city > (sub-national) region > country > subcontinent > continent > global
        *   country protection list > non-country protection list
    *   Device details:
        *   raw User-Agent > browser or OS type > device type
        *   raw IP > partially-redacted IP range
    *   Temporal:
        *   dt > hourly > daily > monthly
    *   Combos of multiple keys > any key on its own (i.e. country + project > country or project)
*   User activity type:
    *   fundraising activity > editing activity > interaction activity > reading activity
*   Wikimedia Foundation activity type:
    *   data collection > data analysis
    *   granular analysis > high-level analysis

Introduction
------------

Data is important. It is one of the ways we can learn and grow as an organization and a movement, and how we can help make the projects better for those who use them to create, learn, and share. At the same time, we are committed to keeping your personal data "for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable U.S. law" (quote from the Wikimedia Foundation ).

This document helps explain how we fulfill this commitment, by describing our guidelines for data retention, system design, and ongoing auditing and maintenance. These guidelines are meant to be a living document — they will be updated over time to reflect current retention practices.

To what data do these guidelines apply?
---------------------------------------

These guidelines apply to all non-public data we collect from Wikimedia Sites covered by the and . Our includes separate data retention guidelines that apply to donor information.

How long do we retain non-public data?
--------------------------------------

Unless otherwise indicated, we retain the following types of data for no more than the following periods of time:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data type | Origin | Examples | Maximum Retention Period |
| Non Public Personal information | Collected automatically from a user | *   IP addresses of site visitors (operational data)<br>*   IP addresses of A/B test subjects (analytical data)<br>*   Identifying user-agent information of site visitors | After at most 90 days, it will be deleted, aggregated, or de-identified |
| Account settings | *   Email address | Until user deletes/changes the account setting. |
| Non-personal information | Collected automatically from a user | *   Data collected by MediaWiki about a user account's activity (e.g., first time a user goes to an edit page, ) | Indefinitely |
| *   Data collected by EventLogging and associated with their user ID (e.g., , ) | After at most 90 days, it will be deleted, aggregated, or de-identified |
| Provided by a user | *   Logs of terms entered into the site's search box, or terms within prefilled links to the search engine that have been followed by user navigation | After at most 90 days, it will be deleted, aggregated, or de-identified |
| Provided by a user | *   Language | Until user deletes/changes the account setting. |
| Non-personal information not associated with a user account[\[T 1\]](#cite_note-1) | Collected automatically from various users | *   Counts of how many times certain events have occurred (e.g. ) | Indefinitely |
| Pages browsed by readers | Collected automatically from a reader | *   A list of articles visited by readers | After at most 90 days, if retained at all, then only in aggregate form |

1.  [↑](#cite_ref-1) For the purposes of this table, "user account" means username, user ID, or IP address; "reader" means visitor to a Wikimedia project.

### How long do we retain public data?

Wikimedia hosts Wikipedia and the associated projects as part of our mission to collect, document, and freely distribute the sum of human knowledge to the world. Accordingly, when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your temporary account username (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you, or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used. If you mistakenly included your personal information in a contribution to a Wikimedia Site and you would like to have it removed, please consult the community's . Keep in mind that the transparency and integrity of our sites' revision histories is essential to our mission, and the Foundation supports our community's right to reject oversight requests in order to protect the projects.

If you choose to register for an account with the Wikimedia projects, you will be asked to select a username. Usernames are retained until the user requests that the account be , or goes through the community process.

For more information, see our .

Definitions
-----------

For the purposes of these guidelines:

*   **"Personal information"** means information you provide us or information we collect from you that relates to you or could be used to personally identify you. For details, please see the Wikimedia Foundation and .
*   Some examples of "public information" would include:
    *   (a) your IP address, if you edited without logging in or using a temporary account;
    *   (b) your gender, if it is disclosed under your user profile;
    *   (c) any personal information you disclose publicly on the Wikimedia Sites, such as your real name or age.
*   Some examples of types of information that are considered to be "nonpublic information" include:
    *   (a) your IP address, if you edited while logged in or using a temporary account;
    *   (b) your email address, if you provided one to us during account registration (but did not post it publicly); and
    *   (c) your general location information as might be derived from your IP address, if you have not posted it publicly. The types of information that are considered "nonpublic" as opposed to "public" are more fully explained in our .
*   Data is **"de-identified"** when it has been aggregated or otherwise retained in a manner such that it can no longer be used to identify the user.
*   Data is **"aggregated"** when the data associated with a specific user has been combined with data from others to show general trends or values without identifying specific users.

An example of how data can be aggregated includes:

Using ranges rather than specific numbers, such as recording that there are "between 1 and 10 editors in language X in country Y" rather than recording that there are 4 editors.

Terms that are not defined in this document have the same meaning given to them in the .

Exceptions to these guidelines
------------------------------

If we make exceptions to these guidelines, we will notify the community by describing the exception on this page.

*   Data may be retained in system backups for longer periods of time, not to exceed 5 years.
*   When we conduct a survey or other research, we will provide you with a privacy statement specifying the term of retention for information (including personal information) collected through your participation in such research. In certain cases, information may be retained indefinitely for educational, development, or other related purposes, unless otherwise indicated in the relevant privacy statement. Such information may be retained in raw, aggregated, or de-identified form until we receive a request from the participant to delete the information.
*   Research related to COVID-19: The Wikimedia Foundation Research team is conducting research regarding COVID-19 and its impact on Wikipedia. Retaining de-identified readership data from COVID-19 related articles will enable us to better understand how to prioritize content creation, to understand what happens to readership when there is a "shock to the system", and to empower the research community to answer such questions. By "COVID-19 related articles", we mean articles that link to the , and Wikidata items. For comparison purposes, we will retain data from a small number of articles unrelated to COVID-19 as well. In order to collect sufficient data, and obtain a picture of readership as time passes, we will be retaining this de-identified data beyond the 90-day retention limit, for a period of one year, ending on March 1, 2021. (Note that this includes a one-month extension due to staffing changes, in order to allow for the project's completion.). For technical details about the sampling and de-identification process, please see [the project page on GitHub](https://github.com/geohci/covid-19-sessions).
*   Editing research: There is a short-term extension applying to data collected as part of . In order to collect and analyze sufficient data, this data must be kept beyond the standard 90-day period. The retained data will be deleted, aggregated, or de-identified within 180 days.
*   Campaign landing pages: for certain events, campaigns, or marketing channels, users may create accounts on special landing pages. After creating their account on those pages, the association between their account and its source may be retained indefinitely, both to provide a good user experience for that account and for longitudinal analysis on campaign effectiveness. For more information, contact mmiller![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org.
*   CampaignEvents extension: An exception exists for data collected by the . The extension collects the global user IDs of event organizers and event participants, as well as which events users organized or attended and when participants registered for an event. In order for the extension features to work consistently, data collected by the CampaignEvents extension may be retained indefinitely.
*   Sound logo contest: There is a short-term extension applying to data collected as part of contest entries to allow the brand studios team to evaluate entries in preparation for announcing the winner in February 2023. The retained data will be deleted, aggregated or de-identified within 90 days after the winner is announced.
*   Webrequest table: There is a short, one-time extension for data from the wmf.webrequest table. This data needs to be retained longer than usual while we investigate a large amount of automated traffic impacting our readership metrics. The data will be retained for an extra 90 days beyond the ordinary 90-day deletion period. After the 180 days, the affected data will be purged and retention settings will reset back to 90 days.
*   hCaptcha trial: There is a short-term extension applying to data collected as part of the to analyze the effectiveness of the risk scores and any changes in registration, edit, revert, and block rates. The retained data will be deleted, aggregated, or de-identified within 180 days.
*   In rare cases, we, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described in our Privacy Policy, may need to retain your personal information, including your IP address and user agent information, for as long as reasonably necessary (which may be longer than the period described in the table above) to:
    *   enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this , or any Foundation or user community-based policies;
    *   investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions;
    *   help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites;
    *   prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public; or
    *   detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns.

Audits and improvements
-----------------------

The Foundation is committed to continuous evaluation and improvement of these guidelines, and to periodic audits in order to identify such improvements. As we make changes to existing and systems, we will update these guidelines to reflect our changing practices.

Design of new systems
---------------------

In order to support these data retention periods and our overall privacy policy, new tools and systems implemented by the Foundation will be designed with privacy in mind. This will include:

*   inclusion of these data retention guidelines as requirements during the design process;
*   legal consultation during the design and development process; and
*   inclusion of privacy considerations in the code review process.

Ongoing handling of new information
-----------------------------------

Despite our best efforts in designing and deploying new systems, we may occasionally record personal information in a way that does not comply with these guidelines. When we discover such an oversight, we will promptly comply with the guidelines by deleting, aggregating, or de-identifying the information as appropriate.

Providing Customized Services
-----------------------------

To enhance your experience with Wikimedia Fundraising Services, we use your geographic location to customize the currency, content, and language of our banners. We may also customize what fundraising banners you see or messages you receive, depending on your interactions with past banners or messages.

Accessing Your Donor Information
--------------------------------

WMF works hard to accurately process and maintain Donor Information. If you would like to request to access, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete the Personal Information we have about you, object to our processing of such Personal Information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), please let us know by contacting us at donate![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org. While we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request consistent with applicable law, there are certain situations where we may not grant your request (such as when we cannot adequately verify your identity to give you access to Personal Information, when we are legally required to retain information, or when we are not technologically able to change or delete information at that time).

All emails sent relating to Wikimedia Fundraising Services (with the exception of receipts or administrative notices) include an easy option to unsubscribe. If you would like to change your communication preferences, you (or an authorized representative) can let us know by contacting us at donate![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia![.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Dot.svg/20px-Dot.svg.png)org at any time, or clicking the unsubscribe link in an email you receive from us.

### Sharing Donor Information

We understand that donors may wish to remain anonymous, and we strive to honor such requests and preserve your anonymity. However, in limited circumstances, we use and share Donor Information in the situations and under the conditions described below. We will never sell, trade, or rent your nonpublic Personal Information.

_With your permission._ With your consent, we may share your information for a particular purpose. For example, we may give donors the option to have their name publicly associated with their donation.

_In anonymized form._ We may publish or share anonymized Donor Information. For example, we may share anonymized data sets to show donation trends.

_Comments and suggestions._ We may publish any comments or suggestions that donors provide us, including in promotional materials, in anonymous form. In the rare instance that we do publish such information with donor attribution, we will do so only with your written (which may be electronic) consent.

_Online payment processors._ In order to facilitate online donations, we have partnered with payment processors. When you make a donation to WMF through the Wikimedia Fundraising Services, whether by credit card, debit card, or other methods of online payment, you transmit your payment data directly to the payment processor. We do our best to use contractual agreements and other mechanisms to help ensure that these processors maintain the confidentiality of your information. However, please be aware that WMF is not responsible for the privacy practices of these processors; please consult the privacy policies of the applicable payment processor for more information about its practices.

_Other service providers._ We use third-party service providers or contractors who assist with the organization and facilitation of the Wikimedia Fundraising Services, or who help run our fundraising operations or improve your experience with them. Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found . We may give access to your personal or non-personal information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. While we cannot ensure the privacy or security of services provided by third-party providers, we do our best to use contractual agreements and other mechanisms to help ensure that these service providers or contractors treat your information consistent with, and in a manner no less protective than, the principles of this policy.

_For legal reasons._ On certain rare occasions, consistent with our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations, we may access, preserve, or disclose to public authorities or other persons your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it is necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. If we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a donor's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system, and the affected donor does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will do our best to fight the request. WMF is committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your personal information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only be able to provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to bodily harm that is created or increased by notifying you of the request, and you have provided us with an email address or other current contact information.

Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

_If the organization is transferred._ In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the WMF changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), further to our legitimate interest, your Personal Information may be transferred. We will provide notice to you via the Wikimedia sites, and a notification on or similar mailing list, at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different donor privacy policy.

_To protect you, ourselves, or others._ If necessary, we may need to use or share your personal information to: enforce or investigate potential violations of our , this Donor Privacy Policy, or any Foundation or user community-based policies; investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions; prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person; protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public; or detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. We do so to manage our relationship with you, further to our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

How We Protect Your Donor Information
-------------------------------------

To ensure a high level of security and confidentiality, WMF employs a variety of physical, administrative, and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your personal and financial information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, you should be aware that no storage system or data transmission is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our security protocols will not be compromised.

How Long We Keep Your Donor Information
---------------------------------------

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible interval that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the WMF donation process, and our obligations under applicable law.

For information on Wikimedia's general data retention policies on the Wikimedia projects, please see our .

Wikimedia Affiliates
--------------------

Wikimedia (such as ) are independent organizations, which sometimes conduct their own fundraising efforts. While some affiliates may give a portion of the funds they raise to WMF, WMF is not involved in processing donations made to these organizations. Wikimedia affiliates have different privacy policies and practices depending on local legal requirements and other considerations. This policy does not explicitly cover donations made to them.

Changes to This Donor Privacy Policy
------------------------------------

From time to time, it may be necessary to modify this policy in order to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. We reserve the right to do so, and we will provide notice of such changes in a reasonable manner and time. We encourage you to review the most up-to-date version of our Donor Privacy Policy periodically.

Your continued use of the Wikimedia Fundraising Services after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of that version of the Donor Privacy Policy on your part.

The **IP Information tool** helps users protect the Wikimedia projects by providing information they need about IP addresses. As a condition of access, users must agree to the following policy.

Background
----------

Wikimedia Sites are the collaborative product of a global community of volunteer users. The Sites can be edited with or without signing into a Wikimedia account. Certain logged-in users are given access to limited amounts of information about IP addresses to help them to enforce or investigate potential violations of Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies.

Purpose
-------

The IP Information tool was developed to help streamline anti-abuse work centered on the edits of unregistered and non-logged-in contributors.

Requirements for access
-----------------------

Users who meet the are eligible to use the IP Info tool and all data offered by it. To gain access, users must enable the tool in Special:Preferences. Doing so signifies your acceptance to be bound by the terms of the present Policy (the IP Information Tool Policy).

### Removal of access

Users may voluntarily give up their access to the tool at any time by visiting Special:Preferences.

Concerns about potential abuse of the IP Information tool may be brought to a by placing a request on . Stewards are authorized to terminate a user's access to the IP Information tool if the user is determined to have misused the tool. If necessary, requests for review by Foundation staff can be made through **ca![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org** and user access removed in line with the . Complaints about infringements of the will be escalated for review by the .

To ensure accountability, a log is kept of tool usage and of which users have access to the tool. Further details are provided below.

Use and disclosure of IP information
------------------------------------

Use of the IP Information tool is limited to certain circumstances and contexts. This section covers the situations in which the tool may be used and when information obtained through this tool ("IP information") may be disclosed.

### Use of IP information

The permitted purposes of use are set out in the Wikimedia Access to Temporary Account IP Addresses Policy, in the section .

The tool should not be used in an illegal manner and should not be used to inappropriately threaten or pressure users of the Sites who are not engaged in prohibited activity.

Information provided by the tool is not guaranteed to be accurate. The IP Information tool currently displays data from [Spur feeds](https://docs.spur.us/feeds?id=feeds) via the and MaxMind's [GeoLite2 databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/static/pdf/GeoLite2-IP-MetaData-Databases-Comparison-Chart.pdf) ([Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20241209060855/https://dev.maxmind.com/static/pdf/GeoLite2-IP-MetaData-Databases-Comparison-Chart.pdf) December 9, 2024, at the ). Use of the tool is subject to the [Spur Intelligence Corporation General Terms & Conditions](https://spur.us/terms/) and the [MaxMind End User License Agreement](https://www.maxmind.com/en/end-user-license-agreement). Unfortunately, because no freely-licensed alternative exists for this information, it is subject to more restrictions than typical tools on Wikipedia. In particular, the following restrictions must be complied with:

*   Do not use, copy, or create derivative works of any information from the tool except as reasonably required in use of the tool.
*   Do not allow anyone other than yourself to use the tool.
*   Do not use the tool for the purpose of identifying a user's real name or physical address.

Externally hosted software will not be granted permission to use the IP Information tool due to the use of Spur and MaxMind proprietary data in the tool.

### Disclosure

In the course of keeping the Sites and its users safe, users may sometimes need to disclose IP information to third parties. Permissible disclosures are limited to the following circumstances:

*   All users of this tool may disclose IP information to other users of the IP Information tool with access rights on an as-needed basis. To check if a user has access to the tool, please confirm within the local Site's page for the ipinfo-viewer right. When possible, users should direct other users of the tool to the relevant contributions page rather than disclose IP information directly.
*   Users who have agreed to the separate may also disclose IP information as permitted under that policy (including any under that policy).

If IP information needs to be disclosed in connection with a , immediately email emergency![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org with details of the request so that it can be evaluated for possible disclosure by or on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation.

Introduction
------------

### Welcome!

The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like , , and .

This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your Personal Information.

*   We collect very little Personal Information about you.
*   We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to third parties.

By using Wikimedia Sites, you confirm that you have read and understood this Policy.

The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more usable, safer, and more beneficial.

We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that when you use any of the Wikimedia Sites, we collect, transfer, process, store, disclose, and use your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.

We believe that you should not have to provide nonpublic Personal Information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.

We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.

After all, it is people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.

#### Definitions

We recognize that only a minority of you are familiar with technical terms like "tracking pixels" and "cookies" used in the Privacy Policy.

Whether you are brand new to privacy terminology or you are an expert who just wants a refresher, you might find our helpful.

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy.

This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/20px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org so we can investigate. |

Collection & Use of Info
------------------------

### Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It

#### Your Public Contributions

Whatever you post on Wikimedia Sites can be seen and used by everyone.

When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your temporary account username (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used, as further explained below in the ["How We Use Information We Receive From You"](#infowereceive) section of this Privacy Policy.

| Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.<br><br>You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer further information, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation and gender. |

#### Account Information & Registration

You do not need to create an account to use any Wikimedia Site.

If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email address (although you can if you choose to, such as for the "Email this user" feature for example).

If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly attributed to your temporary account.

Want to create an account? Great! Do not want to create an account? No problem!

You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia Site, except under . However, if you contribute without signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to a associated with your browser.

If you want to create a , in most cases we require only a username and a password. However, if you choose not to provide an email address, we cannot help you recover your password.

| More on Usernames |
| --- |
| Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse, IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation. No other Personal Information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, and no credit card information.<br><br>Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects. |

To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to, you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

#### Location Information

##### GPS & Other Location Technologies

Some features we offer work better if we know what area you are in.

If you consent, we can use (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy. You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use these technologies in our .

##### Metadata

Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we may receive , such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to the Wikimedia Sites. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

##### IP Addresses

Finally, when you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the of the device (or your ) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to .

### Information Related to Your Use of the Wikimedia Sites

We use certain technologies to collect information about how you use Wikimedia Sites.

Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites.

We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.

#### Information We Receive Automatically

Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This includes when you use an online tool on a third-party site that loads information coming from the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your , your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's , in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.

Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.

#### Information We Collect

We use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable experience for you.

We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include:

*   , which is used to enhance the security of our sites, provide analytic data, deliver our services, and ensure site reliability,
*   , which are used to enhance the security of our sites and to deliver our services,
*   , which are used to deliver our services as requested and for analytic purposes, and
*   A variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as and session storage, which are used to deliver our services as requested.

These types of technologies may also be used in online tools on a third-party site that loads information from the Wikimedia Sites. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.

Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data may include text, Personal Information (like your ), and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit). See below for more information.

We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another user or administrator), please report it to us at [privacy@wikimedia.org](mailto:privacy@wikimedia.org).

| More on Locally Stored Data |
| --- |
| Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:<br><br>*   Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.<br>*   Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.<br>*   Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.<br>*   Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.<br>*   Make the Wikimedia Sites more functional and convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in, to maintain your temporary account session when you edit logged out, or to remember your username in the login field. |

Want to know even more? You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our .

We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. You can learn more about some options you have in our . While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored data.

While the examples above concerning information about you collected through the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your username is made publicly available through alongside actions taken by other users. For example, a public log may include the date your account was created on a Wikimedia Site along with the dates that other accounts were created on a Wikimedia Site.

### Other

#### Location information

##### GPS & Other Location Technologies

As stated above, we can use commonly-used location technologies to show you more relevant content. For example, our mobile apps can identify articles from the Wikimedia sites about points of interest near your location. As a reminder, you can consent to and/or deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time for example through the native OS functionalities on your mobile device, and still use the Wikimedia Sites.

##### Metadata

As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo using the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.

##### IP Addresses

When you visit any Wikimedia Site, we automatically receive the of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

We use this location information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. For example, we use this information to provide greater security, optimize mobile applications, and learn how to expand and better support Wikimedia communities. We also use Personal Information in the manner described in the sections of this Policy titled "For Legal Reasons" and "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others."

Sharing
-------

### When May We Share Your Information?

We use and share your Personal Information when you give us specific permission to do so, for legal reasons, and in the other circumstances described below.

#### With Your Permission

We share your Personal Information for a particular purpose, if you agree. For example, if you receive a scholarship and we ask permission to share your Personal Information with a local chapter. You can find more information in the list of examples in our .

#### For Legal Reasons

We will disclose your Personal Information to public authorities or other persons in response to an official legal process only if we believe it to be legally valid. See also our . We will notify you of such requests when possible. We do so to further our legitimate interest and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third-party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your Personal Information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

For more information, see our .

#### If the Organization is Transferred (Really Unlikely!)

In the unlikely event that the ownership of the Foundation changes, we will provide you 30 days' notice before any Personal Information is transferred to the new owners or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), consistent with our legitimate interest, we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the Wikimedia Sites and a notification on [WikimediaAnnounce-L](https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikimediaannounce-l) or similar mailing list at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

#### To Protect You, Ourselves & Others

We, or users with certain administrative rights, use and disclose Personal Information that is reasonably necessary to:

*   enforce or investigate potential violations of the Wikimedia Foundation or community-based policies;
*   protect our organization, infrastructure, employees, contractors, or the public; or
*   prevent imminent or serious bodily harm or death to a person.

We do so to manage our relationship with you, to further our legitimate interest, and/or to comply with our legal obligations.

We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, need to use and share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our , this Privacy Policy, or any Wikimedia Foundation or user community-based policies. We may also need to access and share Personal Information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.

Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights. These rights may include access to limited amounts of otherwise nonpublic information about recent contributions and activity by other users. They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites. These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines, but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our or similarly protective agreements. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions. However, the legal names of these users are not known to the Wikimedia Foundation.

We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns. (Check out the list of examples in our for more information.)

#### To Our Service Providers

We disclose Personal Information to our third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites and provide services in support of our mission.

We use third-party service providers or contractors to help run or improve the Wikimedia Sites for you and other users. The privacy policies of some of these third-party service providers or contractors can be found on our page. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Policy. For further information, please see our .

If you are visiting Wikimedia Sites with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.

Some of our service providers ask us to post links to their privacy policies; a list of these service providers and links to their policies can be found .

#### To Understand & Experiment

*   We give volunteer developers and researchers access to systems that contain your Personal Information to allow them to protect, develop, and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.
*   We also share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with third parties interested in studying the Wikimedia Sites.
*   When we share Personal Information with third parties for these purposes, we put reasonable technical and contractual protections in place to protect your Personal Information consistent with this Policy and our legitimate interest.

The open-source software that powers the Wikimedia Sites depends on the contributions of volunteer software developers, who spend time writing and testing code to help it improve and evolve with our users' needs. To facilitate their work, we give some developers limited access to systems that contain your Personal Information, but only as reasonably necessary for them to develop and contribute to the Wikimedia Sites.

Similarly, we share non-Personal Information or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites. Sharing this Personal Information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to Personal Information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your Personal Information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your Personal Information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in our .)

#### Because You Made It Public

Information that you post is public and can be seen and used by everyone.

Any information you post publicly on the Wikimedia Sites is just that – public. For example, if you put your mailing address on your talk page, that is public, and not specifically protected by this Policy. And if you edit without registering, logging into your account, or using a temporary account, then your IP address will be seen publicly. Please think carefully about your desired level of privacy before you disclose Personal Information on your user page or elsewhere.

Protection
----------

### How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?

We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

We strive to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know by sending it to privacy@wikimedia.org, so we can investigate the source of the email.

### How Long Do We Keep Your Data?

Except as otherwise stated in this Policy, we only keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to maintain, understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites or to comply with applicable law.

Once we receive Personal Information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible time that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of the Wikimedia Sites, and our obligations under applicable law. In most instances, Personal Information is deleted, aggregated or de-identified after 90 days. Non-Personal Information may be retained indefinitely as appropriate. (Check out the list of examples in our .)

Please remember that when you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, the page history will show when your contribution was made, your username (if you are signed in), or your temporary account username (if you edit while not logged in). The transparency of the projects' contribution and revision histories is critical to their efficacy and trustworthiness. To learn more about our data retention practices, see our .

### Your rights

If you would like to request access to or removal of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

For information about how you may request removal of your Personal Information, or other rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information, see our . If you would like to request to access, update or restrict/object to the processing of Personal Information, or receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization, you may . We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

Please note also that you may be able to exercise some of these rights without our intervention. For example, if you are a registered user, you can access and update some Personal Information in your Preferences, as well as download your user account data. You may also manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.

Important info
--------------

**For the protection of the Wikimedia Foundation and other users, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Wikimedia Sites.**

### Where is the Foundation & What Does That Mean for Me?

The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use Wikimedia Sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.

### Our Response to Do Not Track (DNT) signals

We are strongly committed to protecting users' Personal Information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the ["When May We Share Your Information"](#sharing) section of this Privacy Policy. In particular, we do not share your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit our .

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

Substantial changes to this Policy will not be made until after a public comment period of at least 30 days.

Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:

*   In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users in at least three (3) languages (selected at our discretion) for an open comment period lasting at least thirty (30) calendar days. Prior to the start of any comment period, we will provide notice of such changes and the opportunity to comment via the Wikimedia Sites, and via a notification on [WikimediaAnnounce-L](https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikimediaannounce-l) or a similar mailing list.
*   For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via [WikimediaAnnounce-L](https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikimediaannounce-l) or similar mailing list.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wikimedia Sites after any effective date of a subsequent version of this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part.
