### **Supplemental Terms of Service for WhatsApp Business Channels**

Last updated: February 16, 2024

WhatsApp Channels is one of the “Business Services” provided to you and the company or business that you are authorized to represent (“you,” “your,” or “Company”) by WhatsApp as defined in the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms/). These Supplemental Terms of Service for WhatsApp Business Channels (the “Supplemental Terms”) supplement the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms), and together, apply to your use of Channels. The terms and conditions of the Supplemental Terms will take precedence and apply to your use of Channels. Nothing in these Supplemental Terms limits any of our rights under the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms) or any additional terms or policies they reference.

#### **About WhatsApp Business Channels**

Channels is a one-to-many broadcast service that allows you to view and interact with relevant and timely updates shared by other WhatsApp users. You can create a Channel to share updates, that anyone can discover, follow, and view. The content that you share on Channels will be visible to WhatsApp and our users. We may also list Channels that you may be interested in following based on your country or local language. Learn more about how we recommend channels [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/630432792316720/).

#### **Legal and Acceptable Use of Channels**

You must access and use Channels only for legal, authorized, and acceptable purposes. Channel admins are responsible for the content on their Channels and are required to maintain an age-appropriate and safe experience for their followers.

Channel admins must not engage in activity that violates these Supplemental Terms, the [WhatsApp Channels Guidelines](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-guidelines), or other terms and policies that apply to your use of our Business Services including but not limited to the Acceptable Use of Our Business Services provision in the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms) and [WhatsApp Commerce Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy). This includes:

WhatsApp otherwise does not control what users do or say on Channels, and we are not responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline), or content (including illegal or objectionable content). You can learn more about the restrictions we may impose on the use of Channels, including information on how we apply our policies, procedures, measures and tools [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-guidelines).

#### **Reporting, Content Removal, and Remediation**

WhatsApp users can report any Channel or specific update that potentially violates their rights or our terms and policies. You can learn more about how to report and block on WhatsApp [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/414631957536067).

WhatsApp may remove, prevent sharing of, or limit access to any content or information shared on Channels: that violates our terms or policies (including the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms), these Supplemental Terms, and the [WhatsApp Channels Guidelines](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-guidelines)); where we are permitted or required to do so by law; or if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to WhatsApp. We may also remove or restrict access to certain features, disable or suspend an account, or contact law enforcement to protect our Business Services and our users. We may work with third-party service providers, including Meta Companies, to ensure security, safety, and integrity across WhatsApp, as described in the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms). Learn more about how we address repeated violations of our terms and policies, including the WhatsApp Channels Guidelines [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-guidelines); and how we may suspend access to Channels for repeatedly posting illegal content [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-guidelines/#actions-we-may-take).

WhatsApp further reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate your access to the entire Business Service, consistent with the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms). While we aim to apply our policies consistently across all jurisdictions, in some jurisdictions there may be specific requirements under applicable laws which require varying applications of enforcement.

Where WhatsApp takes such action, we will let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our Services; we are restricted due to technical limitations; and/or we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. Learn more about our Complaints Handling Process [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-guidelines/#channels-complaints-handling-process).

#### **Licenses**

We need certain permissions from you to provide Channels. The license you grant us in the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms) includes the content that you share on WhatsApp Channels and the intellectual property rights therein and among other things, allows us to display and perform (including to the public) that content for the purpose of operating and providing our Business Services, including WhatsApp Channels.

#### **Data Practices**

In addition to the “Other Information” set out in the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms), WhatsApp collects, stores, and uses information such as: (a) information to create a Channel, such as basic information, including a name for the Channel, picture, description or links to third party sites; (b) content on Channels that admins create or share publicly on Channels, such as text, videos, photos, images, documents, links, gifs, stickers, audio content, polls or other types of content in their Channel updates for others to view; (c) information about followers, viewers and other connections, including their reactions, language choices, and the Channels they follow; (d) information about your use of Channels, such as your activity on Channels, the content you view and how you interact with it; (e) service-related, diagnostic, and performance information; and (f) information related to user reports, in order to to provide Channels, ensure the safety, integrity, and security of Channels, and to develop, improve, understand, customize, support, and market Channels and our other Business Services and services.

#### **Functionality May Change or Be Limited**

The functionality and/or performance of Channels may change over time. We may introduce new features, impose limits on, suspend, eliminate, change, restrict access, or update certain existing features or any part of Channels. We may offer limited versions of Channels, and these versions may have limited features or contain other limitations. We may discontinue Channels or any part of Channels at any time consistent with Section 12 of the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms). If a Channels feature or content is no longer available, the information, data, or content created or provided by you in connection with such feature or content may be deleted or become inaccessible.

#### **Updating These Supplemental Terms**

We are constantly working to improve our Business Services and develop new features to make our products even better for you and our community. Therefore, we may need to update these Supplemental Terms from time to time. We will provide you notice of material amendments to our Supplemental Terms, as appropriate, and update the “Effective Date” at the top of our Supplemental Terms. To the extent that we are required by applicable law to notify you in advance of implementing these changes (_e.g._, as set forth in the Platform Regulation), we will provide sufficient advance notice. Your continued use of Channels following the effective date confirms your acceptance of our Supplemental Terms, as amended.

We hope you will continue using Channels, but if you do not agree to our Supplemental Terms, as amended, you must stop using Channels.

#### **Severability**

If any provision of these Supplemental Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it cannot be made enforceable, then it shall be deemed severable from these Supplemental Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Supplemental Terms, the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms), or any additional terms or policies they reference, which will remain in full force and effect.

#### **Dispute Resolution**

You and us agree to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to these Supplemental Terms or the Channels service in accordance with the Governing Law and Venue provision in the [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms) in effect at the time that you or us commence the claim.

### 7\. Our Data Practices

Your Customer Contacts. Company provides customer contact information such as phone numbers (“Customer Data”) to WhatsApp, and Company determines which of its customers it may communicate with using the WhatsApp service. To the extent any data protection or privacy law applicable to your use of WhatsApp’s Business Services recognizes the concepts of Controller and Processor and requires the conclusion of a data processing agreement between them (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, “EU GDPR”), the “UK GDPR” (as defined in the UK Data Protection Act 2018), or the Brazilian "Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados” (Law 13.709/2018, “LGPD”; "Data Privacy Law"), you acknowledge that you are the Controller and instruct the WhatsApp entity you are contracting with, for the duration of these Business Terms, to Process any Personal Information in Customer Data on your behalf as your Processor to enable you to contact your customers on WhatsApp pursuant to these Business Terms and the [WhatsApp Business Data Processing Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-data-processing-terms/). “Personal Information”, “Controller,” “Processor” and “Processing” in this section have the meanings set out in the WhatsApp Business Data Processing Terms which are incorporated by reference into these Business Terms.

Access to data, and to aggregated data. You, and your service providers who manage your WhatsApp Business communications for you, if any, will have access via our Business Services to personal data, such as Customer Data, and Company Content that you provide to us. As part of our Business Services, WhatsApp provides you with aggregated metrics relating to your messaging activity within our Business Services, such as the aggregate number of messages sent, delivered, and read. If you use a service provider to manage your WhatsApp Business communications for you, then by connecting your WhatsApp Business account and providing your service provider with account permissions, you instruct us to provide your service provider with access to these aggregated metrics.

Ranking and Rating. If you use catalog, you determine the order and display of your goods and services in your catalog; we do not rank or use ranking parameters within catalog to display your goods or services alongside or relative to any other business’ goods or services.

Other Information. You understand and agree that WhatsApp collects, stores, and uses: (a) information from your business account and registration; (b) usage, log, and functional information generated from your use of our Business Services; (c) performance, diagnostics, and analytics information; (d) information related to your technical or other support requests; and (e) information about you from other sources such as other WhatsApp users, businesses, third-party companies, and the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). Subject to these Business Terms and applicable law, we may share this information with the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), and we and the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) will use it to develop, operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Business Services, our other services, and the services and products of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies).

Our Global Operations. Company agrees to the transfer and processing of information that we collect, store, and use under these Business Terms, to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, or partners, regardless of where you use our Business Services. You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed may be different from those of your own country.

Legal Disclosures and Third-Party Requests. You agree that WhatsApp may share your information, including Company Content, if we have good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, to legal process, or government requests; (b) enforce these Business Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, and address fraud and other illegal activity, or security or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), or others.

### 8\. Availability

Our Business Services may be interrupted, including for maintenance, repairs, upgrades, or network or equipment failures. We reserve the right to discontinue some or all of our Business Services, in our sole discretion, including certain features and the support for certain devices and platforms.

Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in our sole discretion, we may elect to resolve any Dispute we have with you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the Dispute.

WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers
=============================================

Last Modified: June 12, 2018

*   In addition to the [WhatsApp Business Solution Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-solution-terms), these WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers also apply to you if you are authorized by WhatsApp to deploy the WhatsApp Business Solution as a service provider on behalf of your Clients. To the extent of a conflict between the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms and these WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers, the latter will govern. Capitalized terms have the meaning set forth in the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms and Business Terms.
*   **Service Provider Role**. As a service provider to your Clients, you will comply with all obligations between you and your Clients, including how you collect, store, manage, and use your Clients’ data. You will use the WhatsApp Business Solution, and any and all data derived therefrom, solely for the benefit of each of your Clients. This provision survives any termination of these WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers.
*   **Client Management**. You must ensure that each Client who accesses and uses the WhatsApp Business Solution via your service offerings has accepted the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. In the event that you have not ensured that your Client has accepted the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms, you represent and warrant that you have accepted the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms on behalf of your Client, that you are authorized by your Client to do so, and that you are jointly and severally liable for, and will indemnify us for any harm that results from, your Client’s acts and omissions with respect to the WhatsApp Business Solution, as if your Client’s acts and omissions were your own. You may not directly or indirectly assist or encourage your Client to breach any of the provisions of the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. You will timely notify WhatsApp if you know or reasonably surmise that your Client has breached the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. You may not create a WABA on behalf of your Client without that Client's request and consent. Without our written consent, you may not create a WABA with the intention of utilizing it for a future Client. Unless we have requested for or agreed to it, you must not block or prevent a Client from accessing its WABA. Conversely, upon our written request, you will promptly block, disable, or delete a Client’s WABA. You will only allow access to a Client’s WABA to those who are authorized to do so on behalf of the Client.
*   **Technical Integration**. You will deploy, support, and manage the WhatsApp Business Solution on behalf of each Client in compliance with Documentation provided by WhatsApp. You are solely responsible for (a) creating a WABA account for each Client; (b) providing front-line, primary technical and customer support, and escalating to Facebook any secondary issues that you cannot reasonably address; and (c) providing all network infrastructure, transport layer security, and APIs necessary for each Client to use the WhatsApp Business Solution you have deployed, as between each Client and WhatsApp. WhatsApp is solely responsible for the WhatsApp network, the WhatsApp Business Client, and the WhatsApp Business APIs.
*   **Price Transparency**. You agree to pay Facebook for access to the WhatsApp Business APIs as set forth in the Facebook Terms for WhatsApp Business. You may (a) charge fees to your Clients for accessing and using the WhatsApp Business APIs, including your customary fees for technology integration, support, management, and storage services, and applicable taxes related to the WhatsApp Business APIs; and/or (b) offer access to the WhatsApp Business APIs as part of a bundled offering with any other products or services. You have sole discretion as to the fees that you charge to Clients for access to and use of the WhatsApp Business APIs. However, you will clearly disclose to each Client, separate from your fees, the amount that Facebook charged you for the Client’s use of the WhatsApp Business APIs, and the amount that you charge the Client for its use of the WhatsApp Business APIs. If a Client requests that we send them any information (including billing information) related to their WABA, we reserve the right to do so.
*   **Portability**. If your Client requests to assume control of its WABA, you must reasonably and in a timely manner (not to exceed 30 calendar days following your Client’s request) assist your Client to transfer the WABA account and all related data pursuant to your Client’s instructions, to: (a) the Client’s chosen new service provider; or (b) systems under the Client’s control. Once transferred, you will relinquish all control over the relevant WABA to the Client, and you must promptly delete any WABA data and information from your own systems, unless either we and/or the Client have instructed you otherwise.
*   WhatsApp may update this WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers (“Change”); by continuing to use the WhatsApp Business Solution after such Change, you consent to such Change.

Meta Terms for WhatsApp Business
================================

_Last Modified: October 15, 2025_

  

1.  **Introduction**  
      
    1.1 WhatsApp develops and operates a business service to enable businesses to communicate with WhatsApp consumer users on the WhatsApp network (“WhatsApp Business Solution”). As a distributor of the WhatsApp Business Solution, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is the contracting entity offering you access to the WhatsApp Business Solution, unless you are located in the United States, Canada, or Brazil, in which case, Meta Platforms, Inc. is the contracting entity offering you access to the WhatsApp Business Solution (collectively, “Meta”, “us”, “we”, or “our”).  
      
    1.2. By creating a WhatsApp business account, you and the company, including any Affiliates that you are authorized to represent (“you”, “your”, or “Company”), agree to these Meta Terms for WhatsApp Business and all other applicable terms and policies that are incorporated by reference as described below (collectively, “Agreement”). You represent and warrant that you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity (including any Affiliates), for which you have full authority to bind to this Agreement. “Affiliate” means any entity which, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with you. “Control” means the power to direct the management of an entity, and “ownership” means the beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting equity securities or equivalent voting interests of the entity.  
      
    1.3. Capitalized terms are defined contextually in this Agreement, and otherwise in any additional, applicable terms that are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
  
3.  **WhatsApp Business Accounts**  
      
    2.1. The WhatsApp Business Solution is comprised of a software client (“WhatsApp Business Client”), which you use (on your own behalf or on behalf of your business customers for which you are a service provider) to interact with our messaging and other APIs (“WhatsApp Business APIs”), in order to send messages or use other available features to interact with other WhatsApp consumer users on the WhatsApp network. To use the WhatsApp Business Solution, you must create a WhatsApp business account (“WABA”). To access the WhatsApp Business APIs, you must have a Meta Business Manager account to link to your WABA.  
      
    2.2. WhatsApp provides the WhatsApp Business Solution to you under additional terms set forth in the [WhatsApp Business Solution Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-solution-terms/). Additionally, if you are an authorized service provider to your business customers and are accessing the WhatsApp APIs on their behalf, the additional terms set forth in the [WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms-for-service-providers/) also apply to you. When you use the WhatsApp Business Solution, you agree to these additional terms and they are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
  
5.  **Meta Accounts**  
      
    3.1 Meta is a distributor of the WhatsApp Business Solution, and WhatsApp works with Meta to provide you various tools and features required to access the WhatsApp Business Solution, including:  
      
    3.1.1. [Meta Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/) (management of fees, payments, business insights, analytics, message template creation, technical support)  
      
    3.1.2. [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) (technical documentation)  
    
    3.2. When you link your Meta Business Manager account(s) and Meta for Developers account with your WABA, WhatsApp will provide to Meta your data, metrics, and other information related to your use of the WhatsApp Business Solution, in order for Meta to bill your account, invoice you, receive payments from you, and provide you with business insights, analytics, technical documentation, and product and technical support. Meta provides you with support for the WhatsApp Business Solution and endeavors to provide you initial acknowledgment no more than 4 hours following receipt of your request. The [Meta Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) and the [Meta Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms) applicable to Meta Business Manager and Meta for Developers, and any other additional Meta terms relevant for any other Meta-provided services, govern your use of those services.
    
  
7.  **Order of Governing Terms**. To the extent of any conflict between these Meta Terms for WhatsApp Business, the Meta Terms, Meta Commercial Terms, and any other additional Meta terms that govern Meta-provided services, these Meta Terms for WhatsApp Business will control with respect to Meta’s distribution of, and your access to and use of, the WhatsApp Business Solution. To the extent of any conflict between the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms and the WhatsApp Business Terms of Service, the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms govern. To the extent of any conflict between the WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers and the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms, the WhatsApp Business Terms for Service Providers govern.
  
9.  **Fees, Taxes, Invoicing, and Payment**  
      
    5.1. _Fees_. You agree to pay Meta for your use of the WhatsApp Business APIs according to the list prices and pricing rules set forth in our [Rate Card](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing), and we will invoice you under each of your Meta Business Manager accounts associated with your WABAs. WhatsApp and Meta Platforms data will be the sole basis for amounts that we charge you for use of the WhatsApp Business APIs. We have the right to update the Rate Card at any time; provided that any such changes will take effect the first day of the calendar month following such changes to the Rate Card. Fees under this Agreement may be invoiced and must be paid in USD, unless we support invoicing and receiving payment in other currencies. Fees will be settled in full in accordance with your payment method as set forth below. Any late payments are subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.  
      
    5.2. _For Solution Partners_. We will bill and invoice you for your business customers’ use of the WhatsApp Business APIs, and you will be solely responsible for payment of such fees to Meta.  
      
    5.3. _Taxes_. The amounts we charge you may be subject to and include applicable taxes and levies, including withholding taxes. You are responsible for bearing and remitting any taxes that apply to your transactions. You will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of your failure to do so.  
      
    5.4. _Payment Method_. When you enter into this Agreement, you agree to settle fees as either an invoiced or non-invoiced customer. Invoiced customers are those for whom Meta sets a maximum spending limit for the WhatsApp Business Solution and issues invoices on a periodic basis for payment in accordance with the applicable invoicing terms. Non-invoiced customers will have their funding instrument charged for usage. In its sole discretion, Meta may classify you as an invoiced customer or non-invoiced customer, based upon a variety of factors.  
      
    5.5. _Invoiced Customers_. Meta will extend a line of credit to you and will issue you invoices on a monthly basis. You will pay all fees due under this Agreement, in full and cleared funds as directed by us. All fees are due within 30 days following the invoice date.  
      
    5.6. _Non-Invoiced Customers_. Non-invoiced customers must provide a funding instrument and confirm that you are permitted to use that funding instrument. When you fund a transaction, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the funding instrument you designate for the transaction. You also authorize us to collect and store that funding instrument along with other related transaction information.  
      
    5.6.1. _Authorization_. If you pay by credit or debit card, we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount, which may be as high as the full price of your payment. Your card will be charged at the time you initiate a payment or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds not otherwise being immediately available to you.  
      
    5.6.2. _Failed Payments_. If you pay by debit card and your load transaction results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.  
      
    5.7. _Credit Report_. You agree that we may obtain your business credit report from a credit bureau during the term of this Agreement.  
      
    5.8. _Suspension_. Without affecting our other rights under this Agreement, if you do not pay any fees by the due date, we may suspend all or part of your access to the WhatsApp Business APIs until you make payment in full. We will endeavor to provide you with notice prior to suspension.  
      
    5.9. Depending on the country in which you are located: (a) invoicing and payment for your access to the WhatsApp Business APIs may be through one or more affiliates of Meta (each, a “**Meta Affiliate**”), (b) you may contract directly with the applicable Meta Affiliate solely for purposes of such payment, and (c) you may be subject to other special provisions as described [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/country-specific-non-ads-terms). References to “us,” “we,” and “our” herein mean either Meta or a Meta Affiliate, as appropriate.
  
11.  **Term and Termination**  
       
     6.1. _Term_. This Agreement is effective from the date you create your WABA and will continue until terminated as permitted herein.  
       
     6.2. _Termination for Convenience_. Meta may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any or no reason, upon 30 days’ advance written notice to you, subject to a wind-down period of up to 3 months following the effective date of the termination, during which time you will still be responsible for payment of all fees incurred during the wind-down period for use of the WhatsApp Business APIs. You may also terminate this Agreement at any time, for any or no reason, upon 30 days’ advance written notice to Meta; if you exercise your right to terminate for convenience, there will be no wind-down period.  
       
     6.3. _Suspension and Termination_. Meta may immediately suspend your access to the WhatsApp Business APIs or terminate this Agreement if you breach this Agreement (including any terms or policies incorporated by reference), or if we deem such action necessary to comply with applicable laws or to prevent harm to the security, stability, availability, or integrity of Meta, WhatsApp, and the other [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678). Termination of this Agreement will result in termination of your access to the WhatsApp Business APIs. Upon termination, we will remove your access to the WhatsApp Business APIs, and you also agree to delete promptly the WhatsApp Business Client and any related software code.  
       
     6.4. _Deletion of Your Data_. Upon termination of this Agreement, except for data that we retain for a limited amount of time as required by law or best practices related to financial, tax, operational record-keeping, or audits, Meta will delete any data related to the WhatsApp Business Solution from your Meta Business Manager account and your Meta for Developers account; however, you understand that deleted content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time while deletion is carried out.  
       
     6.5. _Effect of Termination_. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement: (a) you must immediately cease using the WhatsApp Business Solution, except during a wind-down period; (b) at the disclosing party’s request, the receiving party will promptly return or delete any of the disclosing party’s confidential information in its possession; and (c) you will promptly pay Meta any unpaid fees incurred prior to termination (unless Meta has otherwise provided you a written statement waiving such payment). Except as may be specified in this Agreement, either party’s exercise of any remedy, including termination, is without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise. Termination of this Agreement does not automatically terminate any other terms of service that are incorporated by reference into this Agreement which govern other Meta-provided services that you may use without relation to the WhatsApp Business Solution (e.g., the [Meta Terms](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) and [Meta Commercial Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms) may still continue in effect so that you may use Meta Business Manager for other Meta-provided products and services); such terms of service may continue in effect until otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms therein. The following provisions of these Meta Terms for WhatsApp Business will survive termination: Section 5 (Fees, Taxes, Invoicing, and Payment) to the extent there are outstanding fees due, and Section 7 (General).
  
13.  **General**  
       
     7.1. _Changes_. Meta may update this Agreement, including any of the additional terms, policies, or documentation incorporated into this Agreement by reference ("Change"). Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make a Change. By continuing to use the WhatsApp Business Solution after such notice, you consent to such Change.  
       
     7.2. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, as well as any claim that might arise between you and us, are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California, as applicable, without giving effect to their principles of conflicts of law. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement must be commenced exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, and each party hereby consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.  
       
     7.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, and any additional terms agreed upon between you and Meta or WhatsApp, comprise the entire agreement between the parties regarding the WhatsApp Business Solution, and unless expressly agreed upon otherwise between the parties, supersedes any prior representations or agreements. Headings are for convenience only, and terms such as “including” are to be construed without limitation. This Agreement is written in English (US). We may provide you with translated versions of this Agreement for your convenience, but the English (US) version of this Agreement is the version that governs.  
       
     7.4. _Waiver and Severability_. Failure to enforce a provision will not be deemed a waiver; waivers must be in writing and signed by the waiving party. Any terms or conditions in any customer purchase order or business form will not modify this Agreement and are hereby expressly rejected, and any such document will be for administrative purposes only. If any provision of this Agreement is adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, invalid, or otherwise contrary to law, such provision will be interpreted so as to best accomplish its intended objectives and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  
       
     7.5. _Publicity_. Any press release, publicity, or public announcement about the parties’ relationship requires the prior written approval of both parties.  
       
     7.6. _Assignment_. Neither party may assign this Agreement or its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Meta may assign this Agreement without consent to another member of the Meta Companies or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns.
