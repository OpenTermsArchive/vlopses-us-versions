_If you live in the [European Region](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp Ireland Limited provides the Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy-eea)._

_If you live in the [UK](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp LLC provides the Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-uk) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy-uk)._

### WhatsApp Legal Info

If you live outside the [European Region](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1013614932324960/) or the [UK](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp LLC ("WhatsApp," "our," "we," or "us") provides our Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Our Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") helps explain our data practices, including the information we process to provide our Services.

For example, our Privacy Policy talks about what information we collect and how this affects you. It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren’t stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.

We are one of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). You can learn more further below in this Privacy Policy about the ways in which we share information across this family of companies.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.

Please also read WhatsApp’s [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) ("Terms"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.

### Key Updates

Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy) you’ll find:

*   **Additional Information On How We Handle Your Data**. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy provide more information on how we process your data, and our commitment to privacy. For example, we’ve added more information about more recent product features and functionalities, how we process your data for safety, security, and integrity, and added more direct links to user settings, Help Center articles and how you can manage your information.
*   **Better Communication With Businesses**. Many businesses rely on WhatsApp to communicate with their customers and clients. We work with businesses that use Meta or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp.
*   **Making It Easier To Connect**. As part of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp partners with Meta to offer experiences and integrations across Meta’s family of apps and products.

### Information We Collect

WhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.

The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.

Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your Settings menu on both Android and iOS devices.

#### Information You Provide

*   **Your Account Information**. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and "about" information.

*   **Your Messages**. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:
    *   **Undelivered Messages**. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.
    *   **Media Forwarding**. When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.  
          
        We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them. Learn more about [end-to-end encryption](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption) and [how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption-for-business-messages).
*   **Your Connections**. You can use the contact upload feature and provide us, if permitted by applicable laws, with the phone numbers in your address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more about our contact upload feature [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/contacts/about-contact-upload). You can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information. You give your groups a name. You can provide a group profile picture or description.
*   **Status Information**. You may provide us your status if you choose to include one on your account. Learn how to use status on [Android](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/status/how-to-use-status), [iPhone](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/status/how-to-use-status), or [KaiOS](https://faq.whatsapp.com/339368650376736/).
*   **Transactions And Payments Data**. If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy policy.
*   **Customer Support And Other Communications**. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.

  

#### Automatically Collected Information

*   **Usage And Log Information**. We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you [interact with others](https://faq.whatsapp.com/9658856237523915) using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, "about" information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your "last seen"); and when you last updated your "about" information.
*   **Device And Connection Information**. We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers (including identifiers unique to [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) associated with the same device or account).
*   **Location Information**. We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use [location-related features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/675327250630399), like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.
*   **Cookies**. We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize them. For example, we use cookies to provide our Services for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our Help Center articles are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. [Learn more](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/cookies) about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.

  

### Third-Party Information

*   **Information Others Provide About You**. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.  
    You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.  
    
*   **User Reports**. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user. To find out more about what happens when a user report is made, please see [Advanced Safety and Security Features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/staying-safe-on-whatsapp).
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. Businesses you interact with using our Services may provide us with information about their interactions with you. We require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law when providing any information to us.  
    When you message with a business on WhatsApp, keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Meta) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Meta, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly.  
    
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with them to distribute our apps; provide our technical and physical infrastructure, delivery, and other systems; provide engineering support, cybersecurity support, and operational support; supply location, map, and places information; process payments; help us understand how people use our Services; market our Services; help you connect with businesses using our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; ensure safety, security, and integrity; and help with customer service. These companies may provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.  
    The "[How We Work With Other Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies)" section below provides more information about how WhatsApp collects and shares information with the other [Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies).  
    
*   **Third-Party Services**. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). If you use our Services with such third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Use Information

We use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law) to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. Here's how:

*   **Our Services**. We use information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing customer support; completing purchases or transactions; improving, fixing, and customizing our Services; and connecting our Services with [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that you may use. We also use information we have to understand how people use our Services; evaluate and improve our Services; research, develop, and test new services and features; and conduct troubleshooting activities. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
*   **Safety, Security, And Integrity**. Safety, security, and integrity are an integral part of our Services. We use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally. Please see the [Law, Our Rights and Protection](#privacy-policy-law-our-rights-and-protection) section below for more information.
*   **Communications About Our Services And** [**The Meta Companies**](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We use information we have to communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our terms, policies, and other important updates. We may provide you marketing for our Services and those of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies).

*   **No Third-Party Banner Ads**. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this Privacy Policy.

*   **Business Interactions**. We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as [Catalogs](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-catalog) for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.

### Information You And We Share

You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.

*   **Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate**. You share your information (including messages) as you use and communicate through our Services.
*   **Information Associated With Your Account**. Your phone number, profile name and photo, "about" information, last seen information, and message receipts are available to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users, including businesses, with whom you communicate.
*   **Your Contacts And Others**. Users, including businesses, with whom you communicate can store or reshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services. You can use your Services settings and the “block” feature in our Services to manage who you communicate with on our Services and certain information you share.
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. We offer specific services to businesses such as providing them with metrics regarding their use of our Services.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. We work with these companies to support our Services, such as to provide technical infrastructure, delivery and other systems; market our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; protect the safety, security, and integrity of users and others; and assist with customer service. When we share information with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.
*   **Third-Party Services**. When you or others use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). Please note that when you use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Work With Other Meta Companies

As part of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information (see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-information-does-whatsapp-share-with-the-facebook-companies)) with, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings, including the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). This includes:

*   helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;
*   understanding how our Services or theirs are used;
*   promoting safety, security, and integrity across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), e.g., securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;
*   improving their services and your experiences using them, such as making suggestions for you (for example, of friends or group connections, or of interesting content), personalizing features and content, helping you complete purchases and transactions, and showing relevant offers and ads across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products); and
*   providing integrations which enable you to connect your WhatsApp experiences with other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). For example, allowing you to connect your Facebook Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp or enabling you to chat with your friends on other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), such as Portal, by connecting your WhatsApp account.

Learn more about the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and their privacy practices by reviewing their privacy policies.

### Assignment, Change Of Control, And Transfer

In the event that we are involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy, or sale of all or some of our assets, we will share your information with the successor entities or new owners in connection with the transaction in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### Managing And Retaining Your Information

You can access or port your information using our in-app Request Account Info feature (available under Settings > Account). For iPhone users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [iPhone Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/). For Android users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [Android Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/).

We store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.

If you would like to further manage, change, limit, or delete your information, you can do that through the following tools:

*   **Services Settings**. You can change your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our “block” feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.
*   **Changing Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And “About” Information**. If you change your mobile phone number, you must update it using our in-app change number feature and transfer your account to your new mobile phone number. You can also change your profile name, profile picture, and "about" information at any time.
*   **Deleting Your WhatsApp Account**. You can delete your WhatsApp account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information pursuant to applicable law) using our in-app delete my account feature. When you delete your WhatsApp account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Deleting your account will, for example, delete your account info and profile photo, delete you from all WhatsApp groups, and delete your WhatsApp message history. Be mindful that if you only delete WhatsApp from your device without using our in-app delete my account feature, your information will be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect your information related to the groups you created or the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.

You can learn more [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account/) about our data deletion and retention practices and about how to delete your account.

### Law, Our Rights, And Protection

We access, preserve, and share your information described in the "[Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect)" section of this Privacy Policy above if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, legal process, or government requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security, and technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

### Our Global Operations

WhatsApp shares information globally, both internally within the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and externally with our partners and service providers, and with those with whom you communicate around the world, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States; countries or territories where the [Meta Companies’](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) affiliates and partners, or our service providers are located; or any other country or territory globally where our Services are provided outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. WhatsApp uses Meta’s global infrastructure and data centers, including in the United States. These transfers are necessary to provide the global Services set forth in our Terms. Please keep in mind that the countries or territories to which your information is transferred may have different privacy laws and protections than what you have in your home country or territory.

### Updates To Our Policy

We may amend or update our Privacy Policy. We will provide you notice of amendments to this Privacy Policy, as appropriate, and update the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy from time to time.

[](#)WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy
=====================================

Effective May 1, 2021

Table of Contents

*   [Information We Collect](#0aqW3FbhwNCFlGqsv)
*   [How We Use Information](#1snYU3gajAZI4IxDV)
*   [Information You And We Share](#2WkMVB1lqU3eg2SR1)
*   [Managing your Information](#3sDt1Jbzd4Vi2kCua)
*   [Updates To Our Policy](#4ZVrcDmJHiql2dOvm)

This WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices when you use our Services or Business Services, which include the ability to send and receive payments (“Payments”) through the use of [Facebook Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) and the payment services provided by third-party financial institutions (“FIs”). When we say “WhatsApp”, “our”, “we” or “us”, we’re talking about WhatsApp LLC.

Payments contains links to or integrations with FIs and with [Facebook Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). When you interact with these FIs or Facebook Companies, you may be providing information directly to them, to WhatsApp, or to both. These FIs and Facebook Companies will have their own policies describing the collection, use, and disclosure of information by them. We encourage you to review the policies of these FIs and Facebook Companies.

This WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy supplements (i) WhatsApp’s general [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#privacy-policy) (“WhatsApp Privacy Policy”), which applies to the use of all our Services, including Payments, and (ii) the data practices set forth in our [WhatsApp Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms/) (“WhatsApp Business Terms”), which apply to the use of our Business Services, including Payments. If there is any conflict between this WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy and our WhatsApp Privacy Policy or the WhatsApp Business Terms, this WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy will control solely with respect to your use of Payments and only to the extent of the conflict.

Please also see WhatsApp’s general [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#terms-of-service) (“WhatsApp Terms”), which describe the terms under which you use our Services and also apply to Payments, as well as our WhatsApp Business Terms, which describe the terms under which you use our Business Services. The WhatsApp [Payments Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#payments) (“WhatsApp Payments Terms”) supplement the WhatsApp Terms and WhatsApp Business Terms, govern your use of Payments, and describe Payments in more detail.

Please read all of these documents carefully.

### Information We Collect

We receive the following additional information related to your use of Payments.

#### Information You Provide

*   **Registration and Setup Information**. When you register to use Payments, we require you to provide information about your payment method, security preferences, and other information that identifies you. If you choose to do so, you may set up and use the security features provided by your device’s operating system to authorize a payment. Before allowing you to send funds, you may be asked to demonstrate that you are authorized to use your payment method by providing us a one-time password, deposit information, or other identifying information.
*   **Payment Transaction Information**. When you send, receive, or request payments, you provide us with the information and details related to the transaction (including your payment method, payment amount, and security credential such as a PIN). WhatsApp messages sent with payments are delivered once the transaction has processed or when the receiver has reached a transaction limit and are treated as described in our WhatsApp Privacy Policy or WhatsApp Business Terms, as applicable.

#### Information Others Provide About You

*   **Other Users and Businesses**. We receive information about you from other users and businesses. For example, when other users or businesses you know use our Services or Business Services, they may provide information about their transactions with you, just as you may provide information to us about your transactions with them. We require each of these users and businesses to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with service providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market Payments; provide customer support; and keep our system safe and secure. These companies may provide us information about you or your Payments activity; for example, customer support service agents may relay information that you provide while resolving an issue with Payments.

Adding your WhatsApp account to an Accounts Center
==================================================

What is WhatsApp in Accounts Center
-----------------------------------

[Accounts Center](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/) is a place where you can centrally manage account settings and connected experiences across your Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Meta accounts. Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center is completely optional. You can add and remove your WhatsApp account to and from Accounts Center at any time.

By adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, you’ll unlock experiences that work across Meta apps, like the ability to easily share your Status created on WhatsApp to Stories on Facebook or Instagram. You’ll also be able to manage some account settings in one place, like adjusting profile information. Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center means WhatsApp and Meta will share information to provide these benefits, which we explain below and in the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center does not impact the privacy of your WhatsApp personal messages or calls, which will remain end-to-end encrypted. No one else, not even WhatsApp or Meta, can read or listen to them. We also do not share your contact lists with any other [Meta Company](https://faq.whatsapp.com/481188387305001/?locale=en_US).

WhatsApp relies on Meta’s infrastructure, such as servers, to support people around the world with fast and reliable services. In general, access to WhatsApp personal data is restricted, so it’s only used by other Meta apps to determine how many people we serve and keep people safe, or when a user chooses to use an optional feature that works across Meta products.

WhatsApp in Accounts Center is one of these optional features. Other optional features include chatting with Meta AI or messaging businesses that are using Meta’s business tools. Optional features are always explained clearly in the app so you can make the choice that’s right for you.

What information is collected by WhatsApp when you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy) describes information that WhatsApp collects on its services. When you choose to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, WhatsApp also collects information such as:

To enable you to use connected experiences available through Accounts Center, WhatsApp also receives information from other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/481188387305001/?locale=en_US), such as:

What information will Meta receive about you if you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/481188387305001/?locale=en_US) receive information such as:

For what purposes WhatsApp uses your info if you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, WhatsApp uses your info for purposes such as the following:

How Meta uses your info if you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you choose to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, Meta will use your information as described in the [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/), to do things like provide, personalize, and improve its products and services, including to show you ads, measure their performance, and provide more personalized features, content, and suggestions across [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/532729362019677), as well as promote safety, security and integrity. Meta’s own terms and privacy policy will govern your use of Meta services and products.

Of course, WhatsApp relies on Meta’s infrastructure, such as servers, to support people around the world with fast and reliable services. However, access to WhatsApp personal data is restricted so it will not be used by other Meta apps – including for ads - unless it’s to determine how many people we serve, keep people safe, or to provide optional features that work across Meta products.

WhatsApp in Accounts Center is one of these optional features. Other optional features include chatting with Meta AI or messaging businesses that are using Meta’s business tools. Optional features are always explained clearly in the app so you can make the choice that’s right for you.

Does adding WhatsApp to Accounts Center affect whether Meta uses your information when you message a business or share your info with them
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having your accounts in the same Accounts Center does not affect whether your info is used if you choose to share it with businesses or if you message them on our products.

Learn more about [how Meta uses your information across your accounts in the same Accounts Center](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/433719745369721/).

Which of your settings will change
----------------------------------

Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center will allow you to manage certain settings in one place for your WhatsApp accounts, and any other accounts you have in the same Accounts Center. These include things like adjusting your profile information across accounts, and whether to always cross-post Status across your apps. For a full list of settings controlled through Accounts Center, read more [here](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/1894490827562393/).

If you don’t want to add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You don’t have to. Adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center is completely optional. If you choose not to add your WhatsApp account to the same Accounts Center as your Facebook or Instagram accounts, you can still use WhatsApp like you always have.

If you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center and then change your mind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you add your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, you allow us to combine and use your information across accounts in Accounts Center on different [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/532729362019677). You can remove your WhatsApp account from Accounts Center at any time.

If you remove your WhatsApp account from Accounts Center, we’ll stop [combining your info](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/433719745369721/) between your WhatsApp account and the other accounts still in your Accounts Center within 7 days. If you remove your WhatsApp account, your previously combined info would remain combined.

You opted out of sharing your WhatsApp account information with Meta in 2016. How does adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center impact you
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you opted out of sharing your WhatsApp account information with Meta to improve Meta ads and product experiences in 2016, then adding your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center means that you are opting into this sharing, and all sharing associated with Accounts Center as described above.

WhatsApp Avatars Features Privacy Notice
========================================

Effective July 14, 2023

This WhatsApp Avatars Features Privacy Notice applies if you opt in to these avatars features. It explains how we use and protect your information in order to generate recommended avatars and support avatar calling, and supplements the

[WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).  

**Recommended Avatars**

The recommended avatars feature enables WhatsApp, LLC to quickly recommend avatars to you using a photo of yourself that you capture and submit when creating your avatar. If you choose to use the recommended avatars feature, you will need to agree to this privacy notice.  

**Information used to provide the recommended avatars feature**

In order for WhatsApp to recommend avatars inspired by your appearance, we analyze your photo to estimate the location of parts of your face, like your eyes, nose and mouth, and specific points on the contours of those parts of your face ("estimated facial points"). We also analyze your photo to detect the approximate size, shape and color pigment of certain areas of your face ("predicted facial attributes"). Our technology then uses your estimated facial points and predicted facial attributes to create avatars inspired by you, which WhatsApp then recommends to you. If you choose to, you can use the avatar editor tool to customize the recommended avatars before selecting your final avatar. None of this information is used to identify you, and it will be used for the sole purpose of recommending avatars inspired by you.  

Once you select your final avatar, your photo, estimated facial points, predicted facial attributes, and recommended avatars will begin being processed for deletion immediately. The full deletion process may take up to 14 days to complete.  

Subject to WhatsApp's privacy policy, your final avatar will be stored by WhatsApp and on your device so that you can use it for interactive digital experiences on WhatsApp. Once your final avatar has been created, you can delete it at any time by clicking “Delete Avatar” in your WhatsApp avatar settings. Your final avatar will also be automatically deleted if you delete your WhatsApp account.  

**Avatar Calling**

The avatar calling feature enables you to participate in WhatsApp video calls as your personal avatar. Avatar calling is an augmented reality feature that replaces your video with your live avatar.

**Information used to provide the avatar calling feature**

If you choose to use avatar calling, we need to ensure that your avatar appears where you would be in the video and that it displays your facial expressions and movements in real time (camera effects).  

To facilitate avatar calling, WhatsApp will estimate the location of parts of your face (like your eyes, nose or mouth) and specific points on the contours of those parts of your face ("estimated facial points"). We will apply these estimated facial points to a generic model of a face and adjust it to mimic your facial expressions and movements.

This information is not used to identify you. It is used only to provide the avatar calling feature during your video calls. When you stop using the feature or the video call ends, we will stop processing this information. We don’t store this information or share it with third parties.

Subject to WhatsApp's privacy policy, your avatar will be stored by WhatsApp and on your device so that it can be used for avatar calling. You can delete it at any time by clicking “Delete Avatar” in your WhatsApp avatar settings. Your avatar will also be automatically deleted if you delete your WhatsApp account.

WhatsApp Face and Hand Effects Privacy Notice
=============================================

Effective October 15, 2024

This Privacy Notice applies if you opt in to face and hand effects. It explains how we use and protect your information in order to generate these camera effects and supplements the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Face and hand effects are augmented reality features that react as people in the scene move, speak and express themselves. They include filters, masks and other interactive digital experiences. You can use these effects in your camera, photos and videos.

#### **Information we use to make face and hand effects work**

When you use face and hand effects, we need to show them in the right place in your camera, photos and videos and make some effects react to your gestures, expressions or movements. For example, if you select puppy ears, we need to make sure the ears appear on the top of your head and stay there as you move. To do this, we estimate the location of parts of your face (like your eyes, nose or mouth) and points on your face, eyes or hands. For some effects, we apply these points to a generic model of a face and adjust it to mimic your facial expressions and movements. This information is not used to identify you.

#### **What we do with this information**

We don’t process or store this information on our servers or share it with third parties. The information is processed, but not stored on your device and is deleted following your use of the chosen effect.

#### **Using face and hand effects with other people**

When you use face and hand effects, we may process information from images of other people who appear in your camera feed, photo or video. For example, when you use effects on a video call, someone in the background may have puppy ears shown on their head.

### **WhatsApp Channels Supplemental Privacy Policy**

Effective January 21, 2025

This WhatsApp Channels Supplemental Privacy Policy helps explain our information practices when you use WhatsApp Channels (“Channels”). When we say “WhatsApp”, “our”, “we” or “us”, we are referring to WhatsApp LLC.

This Channels Privacy Policy supplements the WhatsApp [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#privacy-policy), which applies to the use of all our Services, including Channels. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in this Channels Privacy Policy have the meanings defined in the WhatsApp Privacy Policy. If there is any conflict between this Channels Privacy Policy and the WhatsApp Privacy Policy, this Channels Privacy Policy will control solely with respect to your use of Channels and only to the extent of the conflict.

The [Supplemental Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-terms-of-service/) for WhatsApp Channels and [WhatsApp Channels Guidelines](https://faq.whatsapp.com/245599461477281) apply to your use of Channels.

#### **What does this Channels Privacy Policy cover?**

Channels is an optional, one-way broadcasting feature within WhatsApp, separate from our private messaging services, that allows you to create a Channel (making you a Channel “Admin”) where you may share updates for others to view (“Channel Content”). You can also view and interact with Channel Content, and follow particular Channels as a follower (“Follower”). Non-followers (“Viewers”) can also view and interact with Channel Content.

Channels are public, meaning that anyone can discover, follow, and view your Channel. Given the public nature and unlimited audience size of Channels, Channel Content will be visible to any user and by WhatsApp. This also means that Channel Content is among the information WhatsApp collects and uses to promote safety, security and integrity on Channels, as further described in this Channels Privacy Policy, the [Supplemental Terms](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/channels-terms-of-service/), and in the [WhatsApp Channels Guidelines](https://faq.whatsapp.com/245599461477281).

Importantly, your use of WhatsApp Channels does not impact the privacy of your WhatsApp personal messages, which continue to be end-to-end encrypted as described in the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#privacy-policy).

In the future, we may introduce additional Channels features, such as new ways to search for Channels and Channel Content, additional audience and privacy settings for Channels, and end-to-end encrypted Channels. If you are already using Channels when we update features and settings, we will inform you of such features as appropriate.

#### **How We Use Information**

We use the information we collect in the following additional ways:

*   **Provide Channels**. We use the information we have to operate, provide, and improve Channels. For example, we may use this information to enable you to create, follow or interact with Channels, to help us to provide or develop additional Channels features, or to [improve](https://faq.whatsapp.com/962978635456336/) your experience on Channels such as to show or recommend to you Channels that are in your country or local language.
*   **Understand Usage of Channels**. We use the information to measure and analyze the effectiveness, performance, reliability and efficiency of Channels, to understand how people use and interact with Channels, and to determine how we can develop and improve our Services.

*   **Third-Party Service Providers and Meta Companies**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand and support Channels. We also work with [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us promote the safety, security, and integrity on Channels and our Services, including use of detection and measurement tools that leverage a combination of classifiers, content and behavioral signals, human review, and user reports—to proactively and reactively detect potentially violating content or use of Channels. When we share information with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.

*   **Accounts Center.** If you have added your WhatsApp account to Accounts Center, see [here](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/Information-used-across-accounts-wa/) to learn more about how your information will be shared.

#### **Managing And Retaining Your Information**

You can [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/6480469855345352/?cms_platform=web), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/214063281402212/?cms_platform=web) or [port](https://faq.whatsapp.com/6480469855345352/?cms_platform=web) your Channels information using our in-app settings set out in the [WhatsApp Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

*   **Retaining your public Channel Content and Channel information**. In the ordinary course of providing Channels, we store Channel Content on our servers for up to 30 days, subject to safety, security and integrity purposes or other legal or compliance obligations that may require longer retention. Channel Content may remain on Viewers’ or Followers’ devices for a longer period, though we may provide options for Channel Content to disappear faster, for example after 7 days or 24 hours should Admins choose. We store other Channels information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Channels Privacy Policy, and the WhatsApp Privacy Policy, including to provide Channels or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our terms and policies, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.
*   **Deleting your Channel**. If you are an Admin, [deleting your Channel](https://faq.whatsapp.com/598838008878228) removes the channel and Channel Content from the Tab in your app at which point it is no longer accessible to other users through Channels. It may take up to 90 days to delete your Channels information on our servers. We may also retain some of your information as needed for things like compliance with legal obligations, violations of our terms and policies, or harm prevention efforts.

WhatsApp Privacy Policy
=======================

Effective January 4, 2021

[archived versions](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy/revisions)

_If you live in the [European Region](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp Ireland Limited provides the Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-eea) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy-eea)._

_If you live in the [UK](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp LLC provides the Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service-uk) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy-uk)._

### WhatsApp Legal Info

If you live outside the [European Region](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1013614932324960/) or the [UK](https://faq.whatsapp.com/523679699550284/), WhatsApp LLC ("WhatsApp," "our," "we," or "us") provides our Services to you under this [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Our Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") helps explain our data practices, including the information we process to provide our Services.

For example, our Privacy Policy talks about what information we collect and how this affects you. It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren’t stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.

We are one of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). You can learn more further below in this Privacy Policy about the ways in which we share information across this family of companies.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.

Please also read WhatsApp’s [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) ("Terms"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.

### Key Updates

Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy) you’ll find:

*   **Additional Information On How We Handle Your Data**. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy provide more information on how we process your data, and our commitment to privacy. For example, we’ve added more information about more recent product features and functionalities, how we process your data for safety, security, and integrity, and added more direct links to user settings, Help Center articles and how you can manage your information.
*   **Better Communication With Businesses**. Many businesses rely on WhatsApp to communicate with their customers and clients. We work with businesses that use Meta or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp.
*   **Making It Easier To Connect**. As part of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp partners with Meta to offer experiences and integrations across Meta’s family of apps and products.

### Information We Collect

WhatsApp must receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.

The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.

Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your Settings menu on both Android and iOS devices.

#### Information You Provide

*   **Your Account Information**. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and "about" information.

*   **Your Messages**. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:
    *   **Undelivered Messages**. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.
    *   **Media Forwarding**. When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.  
          
        We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them. Learn more about [end-to-end encryption](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption) and [how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption-for-business-messages).
*   **Your Connections**. You can use the contact upload feature and provide us, if permitted by applicable laws, with the phone numbers in your address book on a regular basis, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us. Learn more about our contact upload feature [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/contacts/about-contact-upload). You can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your account information. You give your groups a name. You can provide a group profile picture or description.
*   **Status Information**. You may provide us your status if you choose to include one on your account. Learn how to use status on [Android](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/status/how-to-use-status), [iPhone](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/status/how-to-use-status), or [KaiOS](https://faq.whatsapp.com/339368650376736/).
*   **Transactions And Payments Data**. If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy policy.
*   **Customer Support And Other Communications**. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.

  

#### Automatically Collected Information

*   **Usage And Log Information**. We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you [interact with others](https://faq.whatsapp.com/9658856237523915) using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, "about" information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your "last seen"); and when you last updated your "about" information.
*   **Device And Connection Information**. We collect device and connection-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers (including identifiers unique to [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) associated with the same device or account).
*   **Location Information**. We collect and use precise location information from your device with your permission when you choose to use [location-related features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/675327250630399), like when you decide to share your location with your contacts or view locations nearby or locations others have shared with you. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.
*   **Cookies**. We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize them. For example, we use cookies to provide our Services for web and desktop and other web-based services. We may also use cookies to understand which of our Help Center articles are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you. [Learn more](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/cookies) about how we use cookies to provide you our Services.

  

### Third-Party Information

*   **Information Others Provide About You**. We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.  
    You should keep in mind that in general any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages or make recordings of your calls with them and send them to WhatsApp or anyone else, or post them on another platform.  
    
*   **User Reports**. Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user. To find out more about what happens when a user report is made, please see [Advanced Safety and Security Features](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/staying-safe-on-whatsapp).
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. Businesses you interact with using our Services may provide us with information about their interactions with you. We require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law when providing any information to us.  
    When you message with a business on WhatsApp, keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Meta) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Meta, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly.  
    
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with them to distribute our apps; provide our technical and physical infrastructure, delivery, and other systems; provide engineering support, cybersecurity support, and operational support; supply location, map, and places information; process payments; help us understand how people use our Services; market our Services; help you connect with businesses using our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; ensure safety, security, and integrity; and help with customer service. These companies may provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.  
    The "[How We Work With Other Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies)" section below provides more information about how WhatsApp collects and shares information with the other [Meta Companies](#privacy-policy-other-meta-companies).  
    
*   **Third-Party Services**. We allow you to use our Services in connection with third-party services and [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). If you use our Services with such third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Please note that when you use third-party services or [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Use Information

We use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law) to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. Here's how:

*   **Our Services**. We use information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing customer support; completing purchases or transactions; improving, fixing, and customizing our Services; and connecting our Services with [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that you may use. We also use information we have to understand how people use our Services; evaluate and improve our Services; research, develop, and test new services and features; and conduct troubleshooting activities. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
*   **Safety, Security, And Integrity**. Safety, security, and integrity are an integral part of our Services. We use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally. Please see the [Law, Our Rights and Protection](#privacy-policy-law-our-rights-and-protection) section below for more information.
*   **Communications About Our Services And** [**The Meta Companies**](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We use information we have to communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our terms, policies, and other important updates. We may provide you marketing for our Services and those of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies).

*   **No Third-Party Banner Ads**. We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this Privacy Policy.

*   **Business Interactions**. We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as [Catalogs](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-catalog) for businesses on WhatsApp through which you can browse products and services and place orders. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications, and we will honor the choices you make.

### Information You And We Share

You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.

*   **Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate**. You share your information (including messages) as you use and communicate through our Services.
*   **Information Associated With Your Account**. Your phone number, profile name and photo, "about" information, last seen information, and message receipts are available to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users, including businesses, with whom you communicate.
*   **Your Contacts And Others**. Users, including businesses, with whom you communicate can store or reshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services. You can use your Services settings and the “block” feature in our Services to manage who you communicate with on our Services and certain information you share.
*   **Businesses On WhatsApp**. We offer specific services to businesses such as providing them with metrics regarding their use of our Services.
*   **Third-Party Service Providers**. We work with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. We work with these companies to support our Services, such as to provide technical infrastructure, delivery and other systems; market our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; protect the safety, security, and integrity of users and others; and assist with customer service. When we share information with third-party service providers and other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf in accordance with our instructions and terms.
*   **Third-Party Services**. When you or others use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Account), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages. If you interact with a third-party service or another [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products) linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or [Meta Company Product](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). Please note that when you use third-party services or other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.

### How We Work With Other Meta Companies

As part of the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information (see [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-information-does-whatsapp-share-with-the-facebook-companies)) with, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies). We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings, including the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). This includes:

*   helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;
*   understanding how our Services or theirs are used;
*   promoting safety, security, and integrity across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), e.g., securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;
*   improving their services and your experiences using them, such as making suggestions for you (for example, of friends or group connections, or of interesting content), personalizing features and content, helping you complete purchases and transactions, and showing relevant offers and ads across the [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products); and
*   providing integrations which enable you to connect your WhatsApp experiences with other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products). For example, allowing you to connect your Facebook Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp or enabling you to chat with your friends on other [Meta Company Products](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-company-products), such as Portal, by connecting your WhatsApp account.

Learn more about the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and their privacy practices by reviewing their privacy policies.

### Assignment, Change Of Control, And Transfer

In the event that we are involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy, or sale of all or some of our assets, we will share your information with the successor entities or new owners in connection with the transaction in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### Managing And Retaining Your Information

You can access or port your information using our in-app Request Account Info feature (available under Settings > Account). For iPhone users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [iPhone Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/). For Android users, you can learn how to [access](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/how-to-request-your-account-information), [manage](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-edit-your-profile), and [delete](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account) your information through our [Android Help Center articles](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/).

We store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations.

If you would like to further manage, change, limit, or delete your information, you can do that through the following tools:

*   **Services Settings**. You can change your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our “block” feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.
*   **Changing Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And “About” Information**. If you change your mobile phone number, you must update it using our in-app change number feature and transfer your account to your new mobile phone number. You can also change your profile name, profile picture, and "about" information at any time.
*   **Deleting Your WhatsApp Account**. You can delete your WhatsApp account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information pursuant to applicable law) using our in-app delete my account feature. When you delete your WhatsApp account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Deleting your account will, for example, delete your account info and profile photo, delete you from all WhatsApp groups, and delete your WhatsApp message history. Be mindful that if you only delete WhatsApp from your device without using our in-app delete my account feature, your information will be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect your information related to the groups you created or the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.

You can learn more [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/account-and-profile/how-to-delete-your-account/) about our data deletion and retention practices and about how to delete your account.

### Law, Our Rights, And Protection

We access, preserve, and share your information described in the "[Information We Collect](#privacy-policy-information-we-collect)" section of this Privacy Policy above if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, legal process, or government requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security, and technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.

### Our Global Operations

WhatsApp shares information globally, both internally within the [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) and externally with our partners and service providers, and with those with whom you communicate around the world, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States; countries or territories where the [Meta Companies’](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) affiliates and partners, or our service providers are located; or any other country or territory globally where our Services are provided outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. WhatsApp uses Meta’s global infrastructure and data centers, including in the United States. These transfers are necessary to provide the global Services set forth in our Terms. Please keep in mind that the countries or territories to which your information is transferred may have different privacy laws and protections than what you have in your home country or territory.

### Updates To Our Policy

We may amend or update our Privacy Policy. We will provide you notice of amendments to this Privacy Policy, as appropriate, and update the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy from time to time.
