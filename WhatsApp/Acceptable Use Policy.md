### **WhatsApp Messaging Guidelines**

Last updated: February 16, 2024

WhatsApp is a simple, secure and reliable way to send messages and make calls. No one, not even WhatsApp, can see your personal messages which are end-to-end encrypted by default.

These Messaging Guidelines (these “Guidelines”) apply to 1:1 chats, calls, group chats, and communities. Status updates are also subject to these Guidelines.

Use of the WhatsApp Messenger Application is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service) and these Guidelines. The use of our Business Services, including the WhatsApp Business Application and the WhatsApp Business Platform are governed by the WhatsApp [Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms) and [business policies](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/), in addition to these Guidelines.

WhatsApp may take action against violations of our Terms of Service or these Guidelines, based on the limited information available to WhatsApp, including basic account, group, and community profile information, as well as messages reported by other users. Your personal messages and calls are always protected by end-to-end encryption.

*   Do not share illegal content or engage in illegal activity This includes content that sexually exploits or endangers children (including child sexual abuse material) or that supports designated terrorist organizations or individuals. Do not share intellectual property you do not have a right to use. Do not organize or coordinate violent crimes, violence against others, human trafficking, or trade in illicit drugs.
*   Do not engage in adversarial behavior. This includes efforts to undermine WhatsApp integrity systems, abuse reporting tools, compromise user accounts, scrape data, or use unofficial clients, bulk messaging, auto-messaging, auto-dialing, or automation to harm WhatsApp or our users.
*   Do not engage in fraud or spam This includes repeated unwanted contact with WhatsApp users, and activity that scams or defrauds WhatsApp or our users through purposeful deception or impersonation.

Users can report WhatsApp contacts, groups, communities, status updates, or specific messages that potentially violate these Guidelines. You can learn more about how to report on WhatsApp [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/414631957536067/). For information on how to report potential intellectual property violations, please see [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/ip-policy).

#### **How We Apply the Messaging Guidelines**

WhatsApp may use both automated processing techniques and human review teams to detect and review information available to us including account, group, and community profile information, as well as reported messages, for potential violations of these Guidelines.

##### **Automated Processing**

Automated data processing is central to our review process and automates decisions for certain areas where account behavior or reported message content is highly likely to be in violation of these Guidelines.

Automation also helps us prioritize and expedite reviews by routing potentially violating accounts, groups, or communities to human reviewers who have the right subject matter and language expertise, so our teams can focus on the most important cases first.

##### **Human Review Teams**

When an account, group or community requires further review, our automated systems send it to a human review team to make the final decision. Our human review teams are located across the globe, receive in-depth training, and often specialize in certain policy areas and regions, and are able to review account information and reported messages. Personal messages are protected by end-to-end encryption. Our automated systems learn and improve from each decision.

##### **Local Law Violations**

When governments believe accounts, groups, or communities on WhatsApp violate local law, they may request that we review the account information available to us. Personal messages and calls are always protected by end-to-end encryption. We may also receive court orders to restrict WhatsApp accounts. We always assess the legitimacy and completeness of a government request before taking any action.

#### **Actions We May Take**

When we become aware of illegal content or a violation of our terms and policies, we may take action, including the following, and depending on the nature of the content or violation:

*   Warning users of violations of these Guidelines
*   Temporarily or permanently suspending an account on our service
*   Preventing further activity in groups and/or communities \[more info [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/679236580386110)\]
*   Removing violating account or group profile information from our servers
*   Revoking or blocking use of a group or community’s invite link, and/or
*   Reporting child sexual abuse material to NCMEC and/or competent authorities

We may take additional actions as reflected in the WhatsApp Terms of Service.

### 6\. Additional Requirements for Messages Promoting Online Gambling and Gaming using the WhatsApp Business Platform

To message users to promote online gambling and gaming (a subset of real money gambling and gaming), organizations will need to:

*   Request permission from Meta Platforms, Inc. using this [application form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1162151368428352). Note that businesses can only apply to message people in certain countries.
*   Provide evidence that the online gambling and gaming activities are appropriately licensed by a regulator, or otherwise established as lawful in the countries listed in Section 5 that the business wants to send messages to.

We define online gambling and gaming as any product or service where anything of monetary value is included as part of entry or prize. Monetary value includes, but is not limited to, cash or digital currencies like Bitcoin.

Online gambling and gaming activities include:

*   All forms of online gambling. Some common types of gambling include betting, lotteries, raffles, casino games, fantasy sports, bingo, poker, skill game tournaments, and sweepstakes.
*   Games where anything of monetary value is part of entry, and games where anything of monetary value is part of the prize. This includes games that require purchases to continue gameplay or to provide an advantage in winning prizes (in cases where the prize is of monetary value).
*   Promotions for online gambling or games, even if there is no opportunity to gamble or game directly within the WhatsApp chat.

The following activities do not require permission from Meta to message on the WhatsApp Business Platform. However, organizations engaged in these activities must comply with all applicable local laws.

*   Physical, real money gambling activity, or establishments like “brick and mortar” casinos, entertainment events at casinos, or the streaming of offline poker tournaments.
*   State or government lotteries, as long as the business is directly or exclusively responsible for running the lottery.
*   Prize promotions that involve purchasing a product at the usual retail price, so long as online gambling isn’t the primary business model of the business or any featured brand.

*   Driving high quality conversations between people and businesses is a top priority. People can block or report businesses and our systems will limit the amount of messages a business can send or calls a business can initiate if the business' quality tier is low for a sustained period of time.
*   If you use or operate a service which utilizes WhatsApp in violation of our terms or policies, such as messaging people at scale in an unauthorized manner, we have the right to limit or remove your access to WhatsApp Business Services.

Best Practices
--------------

### Best Practices for Opt-In

Users should expect the messages and calls they receive. You can set this expectation by:

*   Obtaining an opt-in that encompasses the different categories of messages that you will send (ex: order updates, relevant offers, product recommendations, etc.)
*   Obtaining a separate opt-in to initiate a call to a user.
*   Obtaining separate opt-in by specific message category.
    *   This mitigates the risk that users will block your business because they receive unsolicited messages.
*   Provide clear instructions for how people can opt out of receiving specific categories of messages or calls, and honor these requests.
*   Ensure your opt-in and opt-out flows are clear and intuitive for users.
*   Clearly communicate the value of receiving this information.

We may also reactively evaluate a business' opt-in flows, including review of user feedback, to flag policy violations and develop additional types of enforcement over time. [Learn more about opt-in](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in).
