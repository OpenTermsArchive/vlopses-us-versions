YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE WHATSAPP PARTIES ARE NOT MODIFIED BY THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER IF THE LAWS OF YOUR COUNTRY OR TERRITORY OF RESIDENCE, APPLICABLE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES, DO NOT PERMIT IT. IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR APPLICABLE STATUTE OR LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, WHICH SAYS THAT: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, AND THAT IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.

### Dispute Resolution

**Forum And Venue**. If you are a WhatsApp user located in the United States or Canada, the "[Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service?eea=0#terms-of-service-special-arbitration-provision-for-united-states-or-canada-users)" section below applies to you. Please also read that section carefully and completely. If you are not subject to the "[Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service?eea=0#terms-of-service-special-arbitration-provision-for-united-states-or-canada-users)" section below, you agree that any claim or cause of action you have against WhatsApp relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with our Terms or our Services, and for any claim or cause of action that WhatsApp files against you, you and WhatsApp agree that any such claim or cause of action (each, a “Dispute,” and together, “Disputes”) will be resolved exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County in California, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or cause of action, and the laws of the State of California will govern any such claim or cause of action without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in our sole discretion, we may elect to resolve any Dispute we have with you that is not subject to arbitration in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the Dispute.

**Governing Law**. The laws of the State of California govern our Terms, as well as any Disputes, whether in court or arbitration, which might arise between WhatsApp and you, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

**Time Limit To Bring A Claim Or Dispute**. THESE TERMS ALSO LIMIT THE TIME YOU HAVE TO BRING A CLAIM OR DISPUTE, INCLUDING THE TIME TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION OR SMALL CLAIMS PROCEEDING TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes defined below) we and you must bring Claims (including commencing an arbitration proceeding) within one year after the Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not bring a Claim (including commencing an arbitration) within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.

**See Below:** [**Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users**](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service?eea=0#terms-of-service-special-arbitration-provision-for-united-states-or-canada-users)

### Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS. IF YOU ARE A WHATSAPP USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AND WE AGREE TO SUBMIT ALL DISPUTES TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. FINALLY, YOU MAY BRING A CLAIM ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY OFFICIAL OR OTHER PERSON, OR CLASS OF PEOPLE. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN, OR HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS, A CLASS ACTION, A CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

"Excluded Dispute" means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents) or efforts to interfere with our Services or engage with our Services in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.

**Federal Arbitration Act**. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this "[Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service?eea=0#terms-of-service-special-arbitration-provision-for-united-states-or-canada-users)" section, including any question whether a Dispute between WhatsApp and you is subject to arbitration.

**Agreement To Arbitrate For WhatsApp Users Located In The United States Or Canada**. For WhatsApp users who live in the United States or Canada, WhatsApp and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes. WhatsApp and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. WhatsApp and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.  
Before you commence arbitration of a Dispute, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your (a) name; (b) residence address; (c) username; (d) email address or phone number you use for your WhatsApp account; (e) a detailed description of the dispute; and (f) the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Meta Platforms, Inc., ATTN: WhatsApp Arbitration Filing, 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you provide, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within sixty (60) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at [www.adr.org.](http://www.adr.org/) Issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.

**Opt-Out Procedure**. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (a) the date that you first accepted our Terms; and (b) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt-out:

WhatsApp LLC  
  
Arbitration Opt-Out  
  
1 Meta Way,  
  
Menlo Park, CA 94025  
  
United States of America

You must include: (i) your name and residence address; (ii) the mobile phone number associated with your account; and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of our Terms’ agreement to arbitrate.

**Small Claims Court**. As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local “small claims” court’s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local “small claims” court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.

**No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, Or Representative Actions For Users Located In The United States Or Canada**. We and you each agree that if you are a WhatsApp user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people. We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular Dispute (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that Dispute (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other Disputes (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.

**Place To File Permitted Court Actions**. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the applicable provision in the “[Dispute Resolution](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/terms-of-service?eea=0#terms-of-service-dispute-resolution)” section set forth above.

Once you have set up Payments, you are able to send and, where available, receive money from other WhatsApp users who have set up Meta Pay on WhatsApp or make payments to sellers. We are not a licensed financial or payment institution; do not receive, transfer, process, or store any funds in connection with Payments; and do not act as service providers to Payments Processors. You may not be able to register for payments or may experience limited functionality depending on your financial or payment institution. The ability to send or receive messages with a payment is a Service provided by WhatsApp.

**Meta Companies’ Role**. When you use Payments, Meta Platforms, Inc. will save your payment method for use on Meta Company Products, relay your transaction instructions, and provide other services to you according to the [Meta Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) and other terms referenced therein.

WhatsApp cares about your privacy. Our general WhatsApp [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#privacy-policy) or WhatsApp Business Terms apply to your use of Payments, as applicable. Because additional information will be collected and processed when you use Payments, the WhatsApp [Payments Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal?eea=0#payments-privacy-policy) also applies to your use of Payments. The WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy, as supplemented by our WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy, describes additional information practices applicable to Payments, including the types of information we receive and collect from you when you use Payments and how we use and share this information.

You must access and use Payments only for legal, authorized, and acceptable purposes, according to our WhatsApp Terms or WhatsApp Business Terms, as applicable, and posted [policies](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/commerce-policy/), including merchant policies as may be published from time to time. We may impose limits on your ability to send or receive payments, including by setting transaction limits. Deleting WhatsApp or your payment method before a transaction is complete may result in that transaction failing. WhatsApp may also cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates the WhatsApp Terms, WhatsApp Business Terms, these WhatsApp Payments Terms, posted policies, Meta Companies’ terms or privacy policies, or the Payments Processor’s terms, or if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or fraud, or protect the security of our users and others. When registering for or using Payments, you must provide accurate, current, and complete information and keep your information updated.

If you send a payment to a user who has not registered for Payments, the Payments Processor may deduct or place a hold on your payment until the recipient registers and performs all the steps needed to receive funds, or until the payment expires, after which the Payments Processor will reverse the payment or release the hold. You may contact the recipient before sending payments to verify whether they are ready to receive payments.
