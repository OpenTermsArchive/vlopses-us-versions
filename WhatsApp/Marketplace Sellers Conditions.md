WhatsApp Merchant Terms of Service
==================================

Introduction
------------

WhatsApp LLC (“WhatsApp,” “our,” “we,” or “us”) provides apps, software, features, services, and APIs designed and developed for businesses that give businesses the ability to receive payment for the sale, lease, or rental of goods or services, (“Customer Payments”). Customer Payments is a “Business Service,” as defined in the WhatsApp [Business Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-terms/) (“WhatsApp Business Terms”). By using Customer Payments, you and the company or business that you are authorized to represent (“you,” “your,” or “Company”) agree to these WhatsApp Merchant Terms of Service (“WhatsApp Merchant Terms”).

**Our Role**. We provide a convenient platform for you to set up and use Meta Pay, a service provided by Meta Platforms, Inc., to receive payment for the sale, lease, or rental of goods or services. Once you have set up Meta Pay through WhatsApp, you are able to receive these payments from WhatsApp users who have set up Meta Pay on WhatsApp. Payments are processed by third-party payment processors with whom you have a direct relationship and in accordance with their terms of service. Payments are not processed by us or other Meta Companies. The ability to receive messages with a payment is a Business Service provided by WhatsApp.

We are not a licensed financial or payment institution; we do not receive, transfer, process, or store any funds in connection with Customer Payments; we do not act as service providers to payment processors; and we are not responsible for service interruptions or failures or acts or omissions of payment processors, payments systems, or financial or payment institutions, including the payment, settlement, and clearance of funds. If you have a deposit account at a financial or payment institution, you have a separate relationship with your financial or payment institution regarding that account, and WhatsApp has no affiliation with your financial or payment institution in this respect, even when your financial or payment institution is a payment processor.

We are not responsible for managing, paying for, or fulfilling any sales that result from your use of Customer Payments. We assume no responsibility for the underlying transaction of funds, or the actions or identity of any transfer recipient or sender.

**Meta Companies’ Role**. When you use Customer Payments, Meta Platforms, Inc. will provide services to you according to the Meta [Onsite Checkout Payments Features Terms and Conditions](https://transparency.fb.com/es-la/policies/other-policies/terms-of-service), and subject to the fees listed therein. In connection with Customer Payments, Meta Companies do not receive, transfer, process, or store your funds, or settle payments to your account.

**Payment Processors’ Role**. When you use Customer Payments, payment processors receive, transfer, process, or store funds; settle payments to your account; and provide services to you in accordance with their own terms.

Our Data Practices
------------------

**Your registration and payment information**. To enable Customer Payments, WhatsApp works with Meta Companies, who process certain registration information according to its own [terms](https://transparency.fb.com/es-la/policies/other-policies/terms-of-service) and [privacy policies](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/). You may also be required to provide your payments processor with certain registration data, such as card number and bank account, that will be processed according to their terms and privacy policies. When you request a payment from a WhatsApp user, we collect information such as the amount requested and timestamp of the payment, which is processed to enable the transaction.

**Other Information**. You understand and agree that under these WhatsApp Merchant Terms WhatsApp collects and stores: (a) usage, log, and functional information generated from your use of Customer Payments; (b) performance, diagnostics, and analytics information; (c) information related to your technical or other support requests; and (d) information about you from other sources such as WhatsApp users, businesses, third-party companies, and the Meta Companies.

**Data Use**. Unless restricted by law or agreements, we will process this information to develop, operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our services.

**Sharing data with Meta Companies.** You agree with and require WhatsApp to access and process certain information on your behalf, and such information may be shared with the Meta Companies. Unless restricted by law or agreements, the Meta Companies may process this information to develop, operate, provide, improve, understand, customize and support Meta Companies’ services.  

**Sharing data with third party service providers.** We also share information collected under these WhatsApp Merchant Terms and WhatsApp Business Terms with payment processors to provide you with payment processing services. These payment processors use the information you and we share with them to provide Customer Payments and may also use this information as described in their own terms and privacy policies.  

**Our Global Operations**. Regardless of where you use Customer Payments, you acknowledge the transfer and processing of information that we collect, store, and use under these WhatsApp Merchant Terms, to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, or partners. For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer and processing of information shall be compliant with applicable data processing laws and regulations. You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed may be different from those of your own country.

Use of Customer Payments
------------------------

**Acceptable Use**. You must access and use Customer Payments only for legal, authorized, and acceptable purposes, including in compliance with applicable anti-money laundering laws, according to our WhatsApp Business Terms and posted [policies](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/commerce-policy/). Deleting WhatsApp or Customer Payments before a transaction is complete may result in that transaction failing. WhatsApp may also cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these WhatsApp Merchant Terms, the WhatsApp Business Terms, the above Additional Terms and Policies, Meta Companies’ terms or policies, the payment processor’s terms, if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or fraud, to protect the safety or security of our users or others, or for any other reason. Other actions that may be taken on your account include: placing a delay on a payment for a period of time, limiting payment methods for a transaction, limiting your ability to make a sale, or deactivating your account. You will not ship or deliver products sold via Customer Payments to any country other than the country corresponding to the country code of the phone number linked to your WhatsApp account. When registering for or using Customer Payments, you must provide accurate, current, and complete information and keep your information updated.

You authorize us to access, use, and interact with the payment processors and Meta Companies about Customer Payments on your behalf, including with respect to authorizations, captures, refunds, cancellations, and the execution and monitoring of activity related to Customer Payments. You also authorize us to receive data from your payment processor to allow us to determine chargeback rates and refund rates for all of your transactions.

**Your Use of Customer Data**. You may only use any data, content, or other information about WhatsApp users that you receive in connection with your use of Customer Payments (a) in accordance with our terms and policies, (b) in accordance with a published privacy policy you make available to the WhatsApp users who use your services, and (c) in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

**No Less Favorable Treatment**. You shall use commercially reasonable efforts to offer or market Customer Payments to customers or prospective customers in a manner no less favorable than other comparable payment options.

**Service Providers**. You may only use others to provide services to you or to third parties on your behalf (“Service Providers”) in connection with Customer Payments if they act on your behalf and are bound by an agreement to protect transaction and user information at least as much as is required under these WhatsApp Merchant Terms, additional terms and policies referenced in these WhatsApp Merchant Terms, and all applicable laws and regulations. A breach of these WhatsApp Merchant Terms by any of your Service Providers will be deemed a breach by you.
