Content Ratings
===============

Content ratings on Google Play are provided by the [International Age Rating Coalition (IARC)](https://www.globalratings.com/)and are designed to help developers communicate locally relevant content ratings to users. Regional IARC authorities maintain guidelines which are used to determine the maturity level of the content in an app. We don’t allow apps without a content rating on Google Play. Note that any ads that appear in the app must not be significantly more mature in content than the primary content within the app itself. Refer to [Inappropriate Ads](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753#inappropriatem/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753)policy for more information.

#### How content ratings are used

Content ratings are used to inform consumers, especially parents, of potentially objectionable content that exists within an app. They also help filter or block your content in certain territories or to specific users where required by law, and determine your app’s eligibility for special developer programs.

#### How content ratings are assigned

To receive a content rating, you must fill out a [rating questionnaire on the Play Console](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/188189#questionnaire) that asks about the nature of your apps’ content. Your app will be assigned a content rating from multiple rating authorities based on your questionnaire responses. Misrepresentation of your app’s content may result in removal or suspension, so it is important to provide accurate responses to the content rating questionnaire.

To prevent your app from being listed as “Unrated”, you must complete the content rating questionnaire for each new app submitted to the Play Console, as well as for all existing apps that are active on Google Play. Apps without a content rating will be removed from the Play Store.

If you make changes to your app content or features that affect the responses to the rating questionnaire, you must submit a new content rating questionnaire in the Play Console.

The content rating assigned to your app is specific to the content within your app. It does not include other features and practices, such as consumer agreements or ads. You are responsible for informing your users of any additional age-based considerations, such as age-specific privacy practices.

For more information on the questionnaire, visit the [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859655) to learn about the different [rating authorities](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/188189#ratings)across regions and how to complete the content rating questionnaire.

#### Rating appeals

If you do not agree with the rating assigned to your app, you can appeal directly to the IARC rating authority using the link provided in your certificate email.

Requirements related to content ratings for apps, games and the ads served on both
==================================================================================

You can communicate familiar and locally relevant content ratings to your users and help improve app engagement by targeting the right audience for your content and for the ads that appear in it. To create a good experience for your users, make sure your app’s content ratings are locally relevant and familiar to the target audience.

How apps receive content ratings
--------------------------------

Your app’s content ratings are assigned by separate rating authorities and determined by your questionnaire responses. Because they are independent third parties, each rating authority uses its own methodology to assign ratings. (See [Rating authorities and descriptions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859655#ratings).)

To receive a rating for each of your apps and games, fill out a rating questionnaire in Google Play Console. Provide accurate, complete information about the nature of your app’s content. Your questionnaire responses determine the ratings assigned to your app. After you submit your information, you’ll receive a content rating from multiple rating authorities no matter where you’re located. Google Play will display that rating on your app.

You need to complete the content rating questionnaire for both your new and existing apps, including:

*   New apps submitted to Google Play Console
*   Existing apps that are active on Google Play but lack a rating
*   All app updates where there has been a change to your content or features that would affect the responses to the questionnaire

To benefit your users, include the assigned rating when advertising your app in each respective region, following these [display guidelines](https://www.globalratings.com/display.aspx).

How content ratings are used
----------------------------

App ratings are meant to do more than reflect the intended audience. They’re meant to help consumers, especially parents, identify whether the app is appropriate for what the consumers are looking for, along with other purposes, like:

*   Blocking or filtering your content in certain territories or to specific users where legally required
*   European Economic Area (EEA), UK, Switzerland, and Australia only: Blocking the acquisition and purchase of mature content for non-supervised accounts that are not confirmed adults
*   EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Australia only: Blocking or filtering mature content from Google Play search and browse pages for declared teens or "high confidence" teens, except through deep linking
*   Evaluating your app’s eligibility for special developer programs

All rating icons are protected trademarks of the respective rating authority, and their misuse may result in legal action. Find specifics about rating icon usage on each [rating authority’s website](https://www.globalratings.com/contact-us.aspx).

Understanding your target audience selection
--------------------------------------------

To better serve users, it’s important to provide accurate information about your app. In addition to filling out the [content rating questionnaire](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859655), you’ll also need to provide details about your app’s target audience and content. Depending on the target audience selections you make, your app may be subject to additional Google Play policies. For example:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Your app is designed primarily for children under 13 | You must comply with Google Play [Families](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877766#!?zippy_activeEl=families-policy#families-policy) policy requirements, including the requirement to use only [Families Self-Certified Ads SDKs](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12289447) to serve ads. |
| Your app is designed for everyone, including children | Any apps that have at least one target audience age group that includes children must comply with Google Play [Families](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877766#!?zippy_activeEl=families-policy#families-policy) policy requirements, including the requirement to use only [Families Self-Certified Ads SDKs](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12289447) to serve ads to children and users of unknown age. |
| Your app is not designed for children | You must still meet the requirements outlined in Google Play [Developer Program policies](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/) and [Developer Distribution Agreement](https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html). |

**Note**: For more insight on this topic, see [Managing target audience and app content settings](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9867159?hl=en).

How to manage target audience and app content settings
------------------------------------------------------

If you create a new app or publish an update to an existing app, you’ll be required to declare your app’s target age group. Any apps that include children in their target audience must comply with Google Play's [Families](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877766#!?zippy_activeEl=families-policy#families-policy) policy requirements. Before filling out the "Target audience and content" section, you must have [declared whether or not your app contains ads](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859455#ads) and [provided instructions for app access](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9815348#app_access). You must also [add a privacy policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859455).

For detailed instructions on how to declare your app’s target age group, read [Manage target audience and app content settings](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9867159?hl=en).

How to make sure ads are suitable for your app’s content rating
---------------------------------------------------------------

Ads and their associated offers (like an ad promoting the download of another app) must be appropriate for your app’s content rating. Even if all of your app-specific content complies with our policies and matches your app’s content rating, you also need to check the ads and offers shown in your app to make sure they’re appropriate for that rating. For examples of ads that don’t match an app’s content rating, review the [Inappropriate Ads](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753#inappropriate) policy. 

Setting your ad filters appropriately helps make sure ad services and ad content are appropriate for your app’s content rating. 

*   Check with your ad service provider to make sure the advertising campaigns you selected will only show content that matches your app’s content rating. 
*   If you use AdMob, review the [AdMob Help Center article](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/7562142?hl=en&ref_topic=7384665) for steps about how to use blocking controls and set the right ad content rating.

How to complete a rating questionnaire
--------------------------------------

Make sure to provide accurate responses to the content rating questionnaire. If you have questions about the rating assigned to your app, contact the rating authority directly using the link provided in your certificate email. Misrepresentation of your app’s content may result in its removal or suspension.

Unrated apps also may be removed from Google Play. To prevent your apps from being listed as Unrated, open Google Play Console, go to the **[App content](https://play.google.com/console/app/app-content/summary)** page, and fill out the questionnaire for each of your apps as soon as possible.

Follow these steps to take the rating questionnaire. It’s critical to provide complete and accurate responses to every question.

1.  Open Google Play Console and go to the [**App content**](https://play.google.com/console/app/app-content/summary) page (**Policy** > **App content)**.
2.  Click **Start**.
3.  Review the information about the questionnaire and enter your email address.
    *   Your email address will be used for correspondence with [International Age Rating Coalition (IARC)](https://www.globalratings.com/) .
4.  Select a category and click **Next**.
5.  Complete the questionnaire.
    *   To change any of your responses after you’ve completed a section, click **Edit**.
    *   If you’ve started taking the questionnaire and want to finish later, click **Save draft**. Each app can have one draft questionnaire at a time.
6.  Your responses will generate calculated ratings shown on the **Summary** page. Review the ratings and click **Submit**. If you don’t think the ratings accurately reflect your content, you can retake the questionnaire. Click **Start new questionnaire** on the **Content rating** page.

After you’ve submitted the calculated ratings, you can review them along with your questionnaires in the "Target audience and content" section of the **App content** page.

Understanding your content ratings results
------------------------------------------

Your app can earn different ratings in different territories because rating standards can have differences by territory, each rating authority uses its own logic when rating apps.

Rating authorities participating in IARC may change your app's rating after a review. If a rating authority overrides your app rating and you want to update your responses, you’ll need to complete the questionnaire again.

**Note**: The calculated rating shown on the **Summary** page may not be the rating shown to users on Google Play. App updates and submissions can be rejected for misrepresenting an app's content. Your questionnaire responses may be used to generate ratings for specific territories as required by local law.

How to appeal your content rating
---------------------------------

If you object to the rating assigned to your app by a participating IARC rating authority, you have the right to appeal directly using the link provided in your certificate email. If you have other questions for IARC, not related to appeals, you can [contact them on their website](https://www.globalratings.com/developer-contactus.aspx).

Exploring rating authorities and descriptions

| ![3](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/4CF58C8406621D9B1E14B3515D811E5777C8) | **PEGI 3**<br><br>The content of apps with this rating is considered suitable for all age groups. Some violence in a comical context (typically cartoonlike - Bugs Bunny or Tom & Jerry - forms of violence) is acceptable. A child should not be able to associate the character on the screen with real life characters, they should be distinctly fantasy. The app should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to scare young children. No bad language should be heard. |
| ![7](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/42A78F6DEF3A365800C035E329EB3B131F3E) | **PEGI 7**<br><br>Any app that would normally be rated at 3 but contains some scenes or sounds that can possibly be frightening for children may be considered suitable in this category. There can only be very mild violence in a PEGI 7 app, like implied violence or non-detailed, non-realistic violence. |
| ![12](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/F400AFAEE8720E3DAA2081BCADD1CE0BA94E) | **PEGI 12**<br><br>Games or apps that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters, or non-graphic violence towards human-looking characters or animals would fall in this age category, as well as nudity of a slightly more graphic nature and simulated gambling. Any bad language in this category must be mild and fall short of sexual expletives. |
| ![16](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/3F9E8FB9295A4793C5B3C0B9631D70C106CD) | **PEGI 16**<br><br>Once the depiction of violence or sexual activity reaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life, this rating is applied. Stronger inappropriate language, encouraging the use of tobacco or drugs and depicting criminal activities can be content of apps that are rated 16. |
| ![18](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/97501F873381FC5FFC86AC60E700E10E68CB) | **PEGI 18**<br><br>The adult classification is applied when the level of violence reaches a stage where it becomes a depiction of gross violence and/or includes elements of specific types of violence (motiveless killing, violence towards defenceless characters or sexual violence). It may also include graphic sexual content, discrimination or the glamorisation of illegal drugs use. |
| ![Guidance recommended](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/DC0B7C7D02F370DD5AE0E738A2D92EDF3308) | **PARENTAL GUIDANCE RECOMMENDED**<br><br>Apps do not always have predefined content that can be classified beforehand. Certain apps function as portals (e.g. to stream content), offering a broad, variable range of content from which consumers can choose. For these apps, we use the parental guidance icon, alerting parents that the app may provide access to content that is not appropriate for their child, although other, age-appropriate content may also be available, depending on the selection of the user. |

| ![0](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/5049013C84FF5F576C06FD6F6583444590DC) | **All ages**<br><br>Apps without age restriction feature contents without youth protection relevance. They can be directly aimed at children and young persons but also at an adult audience. For instance, utility programs, product catalogues or tool apps fall into this category as well as social networks in which all user-generated content is being thoroughly reviewed, filtered or moderated. |
| ![6](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/F14F9940B3A282AB9043767BB96210FAFCAC) | **USK: Ages 6 and above**<br><br>Apps in this category can contain elements that may not be appropriate for pre-school children. They may contain occasional scary moments, a low accumulation of mild cursing or subtle erotic innuendo. If violent imageries are present they remain abstract and are not decisive for the overall product. Games in this age category can still be categorized as family-friendly but involve more exciting and competitive aspects. |
| ![12](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/FF239E88BD5F0D950D3B5AA6C0725981E765) | **USK: Ages 12 and above**<br><br>Apps in this category can have an impairing effect on younger children through the inclusion of scary elements, shock effects, some explicit language, sexual contents or occasional violent imageries. Games in this category can feature much more of a competitive edge and hectic gameplay. Please keep in mind that in social networks or user-generated content might generally contribute to the youth protection relevance. |
| ![16](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/F21B37D6D9C011FC2C171E9AC3DE30A13302) | **USK: Ages 16 and above**<br><br>Some realistically designed displays of violence, an accumulation of shock and horror elements, consistently explicit language or apps with an erotic or sexual focus are summarized in this category. Games frequently feature armed combat, a framework story and military missions. The genres in this categorization also include action adventures, military strategy games and first person shooter. |
| ![18](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/21C66B99BD29B1CFDD97938EF880A6B1E4B9) | **USK: Ages 18 and above**<br><br>Among other aspects such as the unquestioned display of drug use for example, realistic and explicit violence is the most common reason for the 18+ classification of these apps. Games in this age category virtually always involve violent game concepts that are prominent in the majority of game objectives. |

Refused classification

On a limited basis, rating authorities can refuse classification for an app distributed in their territory. This means that the distribution of the app or game is not allowed in the rating authority's territory.

If an app or game is refused classification in a territory:

*   IARC will notify the app's developer of the decision by email.
*   In place of a rating from a rating authority, ![RC](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/l-rhNNgGTriLXvnsQn2UtA7FOQUAJtlFbU9F-Vm4RlA41WULob7pkq_NT5SNMw=w16) Refused classification will be displayed in Play Console instead.
*   Google Play will remove apps and games with the "Refused classification" designation in the applicable territory only.

If one of your apps or games receives this designation and you want to file an appeal, you can appeal using the URL provided in your email notification from IARC.
