Ratings & Review on the Play Store
==================================

On this page you can find information about ratings and reviews on Google Play, as well Google’s policies for posting reviews.

You can write reviews for anything you've purchased or rented from Google Play. Reviews are a great way to help others decide what to get by telling them about your experience. Google doesn't pay anyone to rate or review content on Play, and we expect reviewers to be honest and unbiased.

How ratings are calculated
--------------------------

Play Store ratings for apps, and the corresponding bar graphs showing the proportional number of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 star reviews, are calculated based on the app's current quality ratings from user reviews, rather than the lifetime average value of user reviews, unless the app has very few ratings. This gives users more insight into the app, and a better understanding of its current state, since apps can change over time, and often add and remove features. We show the total lifetime number of reviews as this provides users with valuable information about the app's use and longevity.

Ratings for other content on the Play Store (books, movies, tv shows) are calculated based on the lifetime average value of user reviews of that content.

What others will see when you leave a review
--------------------------------------------

Most reviews are visible to everyone, and the Play Store app will indicate whether your review will be public or private.

Public reviews will show your name and image from your Google account and past review edits to anyone who uses Play (including developers). Private reviews are usually for apps in early access or beta testing, and only the developer can see your review, including your name and, account image from your Google account, and past edits. For both public and private reviews, developers are also able to see your language, device and country and device information (such as language, model, and OS version). Developers can also reply to reviews and may use this information to reply to you. If you edit a review, other users and developers can still see past edits unless you delete the review.

Ratings and reviews posting policies
------------------------------------

Ratings and reviews are meant to be helpful and trustworthy. Reviewing content on Play is a great way to share helpful feedback and assist other Play users in finding great content and services.

Guidelines for writing a good review
------------------------------------

*   Make your reviews useful and informative.
*   Try to include both positives and drawbacks.
*   Keep it readable; check grammar and spelling, and don't use excessive capitalization and punctuation.
*   Be nice to others.

Google Play's policies for ratings and reviews are below. Reviews and comments that are offensive or violate these policies will be removed through a combination of automated and human review, and anyone who repeatedly or egregiously violates them may lose the ability to post on the Play store.

Spam and fake reviews
---------------------

Your reviews should reflect the experience you've had with the content or service you're reviewing.

*   Don't post fake or inaccurate reviews.
*   Don't post the same review multiple times.
*   Don't post reviews for the same content from multiple accounts.
*   Don't post reviews to mislead other users or manipulate the rating.
*   Don't post reviews on behalf of others.
*   Don't misrepresent your identity or your connection to the content you're reviewing.

Off-topic reviews
-----------------

Keep reviews on-topic and relevant to the content, service, or experience you're reviewing.

*   Don't post solicitations, political or social commentary, or anything else that is irrelevant to the content, service, or core of the consumer experience you're reviewing.

Advertising
-----------

We want reviews to be useful, and they aren't useful if they're promoting something other than the content or service you're reviewing.

*   Don't post promotional or commercial content for any products or services, including affiliate or referral-based promotions.
*   Don't post phone numbers, email addresses, or links to other websites.

Conflict of interest
--------------------

Reviews are most valuable when they're genuine and unbiased. They should be written by people who aren't motivated by financial gain.

*   Don't offer or accept money, products, or services in exchange for posting reviews.
*   Don't review content, services, or experiences if you own or work for the business that created it.

Copyrighted content
-------------------

Reviews should be your own and reflect your personal opinions.

*   Don't post reviews that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, including copyright.

[Learn how to remove copyrighted content](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905)

Personal and confidential information
-------------------------------------

Reviews are meant to share experiences, and you can express the way you feel about something without revealing sensitive personal information.

*   Don't post personal or confidential information, such as a physical address or driver's license number.

Illegal content
---------------

Your reviews must comply with the law and any terms or legal agreements you have agreed to.

*   Don't post reviews that contain or link to illegal content.

Sexually explicit content
-------------------------

Google Play is intended for a broad audience, and reviews should reflect that.

*   Don't post reviews that contain, promote, or solicit sexually explicit content.
*   Don't post reviews that depict children in sexual situations or address them in a sexual manner.

Hate speech
-----------

Google Play is intended for all people, and reviews should reflect that.

*   Don't promote violence, condone violence, or incite hatred toward an individual or group based on their race, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.

Offensive reviews
-----------------

Google Play is meant to entertain and inform, not attack and offend.

*   Don't post obscene, profane, or offensive language.
*   Don't post reviews that harass, bully, or attack others.

Child Endangerment
==================

Apps that do not prohibit users from creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children will be subject to immediate removal from Google Play. This includes all child sexual abuse materials. To report content on a Google product that may exploit a child, click **[Report abuse](https://support.google.com/googleplay/contact/rap_family)**. If you find content elsewhere on the internet, please contact [the appropriate agency in your country](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666) directly. 

We prohibit the use of apps to endanger children. This includes but is not limited to use of apps to promote predatory behavior towards children, such as:

*   Inappropriate interaction targeted at a child (for example, groping or caressing).
*   Child grooming (for example, befriending a child online to facilitate, either online or offline, sexual contact and/or exchanging sexual imagery with that child).
*   Sexualization of a minor (for example, imagery that depicts, encourages or promotes the sexual abuse of children or the portrayal of children in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children).
*   Sextortion (for example, threatening or blackmailing a child by using real or alleged access to a child’s intimate images).
*   Trafficking of a child (for example, advertising or solicitation of a child for commercial sexual exploitation).

We will take appropriate action, which may include reporting to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, if we become aware of content with child sexual abuse materials. If you believe a child is in danger of or has been subject to abuse, exploitation, or trafficking, please contact your local law enforcement and contact a child safety organization listed [here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666).

In addition, apps that appeal to children but contain adult themes are not allowed, including but not limited to:

*   Apps with excessive violence, blood, and gore.
*   Apps that depict or encourage harmful and dangerous activities.

We also don’t allow apps that promote negative body or self image including apps that depict for entertainment purposes plastic surgery, weight loss, and other cosmetic adjustments to a person's physical appearance.

#### **Child Safety Standards Policy**

Google Play requires Social and Dating apps to comply with our Child Safety Standards policy.

These apps must:

*   **Have Published Standards:** Your app must explicitly prohibit Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) in publicly accessible standards, such as your app’s terms of service, community guidelines or any other publicly available user policy documentation.
*   **Provide an In-App** **Mechanism for User Feedback:** You must self-certify that you provide a mechanism within your app for users to submit feedback, concerns, or reports in your app.
*   **Address CSAM:** You must self-certify that your app takes appropriate action, including but not limited to removing CSAM, after obtaining actual knowledge of it, in accordance with your published standards and relevant laws.
*   **Comply with Child Safety Laws:** You must self-certify that your app complies with applicable child safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to, having a process in place to report confirmed CSAM to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://report.cybertip.org/) or your [relevant regional authority](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/148666).
*   **Provide a Child Safety Point of Contact:** Your app must provide a designated point of contact to receive potential notifications from Google Play about CSAE content found in your app or on your platform. This representative must be positioned to speak to your enforcement and review procedures and to take action if required.

Learn more here about these requirements and how to comply in our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14747720) article.

Google Play's Target API Level Policy
=====================================

_**Disclaimer:** Policy summaries and Key Considerations are overviews only; always refer to the full policy for compliance. The full policy takes precedence in case of conflict._

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

Apps must target a recent Android API level to provide users with security and performance improvements. For new apps and app updates, you _must_ target an API level within one year of the latest major Android release; otherwise, Google Play will prevent your new app or app update submission. Existing apps that are not updated need to target an API level within two years of the latest major Android release to be visible to new users on newer Android versions. For exact timelines and exceptions, please refer to the [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11926878) article.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

To provide users with a safe and secure experience, Google Play requires the following target API levels for **all apps**:

**New apps and app updates MUST** target an Android API level within one year of the latest major Android version release. New apps and app updates that fail to meet this requirement will be prevented from app submission in Play Console.

**Existing Google Play apps that are not updated** and that do not target an API level within two years of the latest major Android version release, will not be available to new users with devices running newer versions of Android OS. Users who have previously installed the app from Google Play will continue to be able to discover, re-install, and use the app on any Android OS version that the app supports.

For technical advice on how to meet the target API level requirement, please consult the [migration guide](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html). 

For exact timelines and exceptions, please refer to this [Help Center article](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11926878).

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Target an Android API level within one year of the latest major Android release if you are submitting a new app or app update to Google Play. | Don't ignore target API level requirements; non-compliance blocks new apps and app updates submission to Google Play and discoverability for new users with devices targeting newer Android versions, if the app is existing on Google Play. |
| Ensure your existing app targets an Android API level within 2 years of the latest major Android release to stay discoverable to users on newer Android OS versions. | Don't delay updating your app's target API level; Start the migration process at least 3 months before the deadline to give yourself enough time to test for and address any compatibility issues. |
| Request target API level extensions through Play Console. |     |

Financial Services
==================

**Changes are coming to this article**

This article will be updated with recently [announced](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/announcements/13412212) changes.

For [personal loan apps in Thailand](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9876821#thailand), we’re updating the Google Play listing requirements to display additional information such as the loan service provider, maximum interest rates, and all fees. This applies immediately to new apps, and existing apps will have until March 4, 2026 to come into compliance. For more details, go to the [Policy Deadlines](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/12921780) page.

To preview the updated “Financial Services” article, visit [this page](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16597822).

We don't allow apps that expose users to deceptive or harmful financial products and services.

For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice.

If your app contains or promotes financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any region or country that your app targets—for example, include specific disclosures required by local law.

Any app that contains any financial features must complete the Financial features declaration form within [Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/app/app-content/financial-features).

#### Binary Options

We do not allow apps that provide users with the ability to trade binary options.

#### Loans

Personal Loans: We define personal loans as lending money from one individual, organization, or entity to an individual consumer on a nonrecurring basis, not for the purpose of financing purchase of a fixed asset or education. Personal loan consumers require information about the quality, features, fees, repayment schedule, risks, and benefits of loan products in order to make informed decisions about whether to undertake the loan.

*   Examples: Personal loans, payday loans, peer-to-peer loans, title loans
*   Examples not included: Mortgages, car loans, revolving lines of credit (such as credit cards, personal lines of credit)

Earned Wage Access: We define earned wage access loans (EWA) as a financial service that allows individuals to access a portion of their wages that have already been earned but not yet paid by their employer. Unlike traditional loans, EWA services are characterized by the following features:

*   Repayment Mechanism: Repayment occurs automatically via payroll deduction or through an autopay transaction linked to the user’s bank account. If the autopay transaction fails, no additional interest, penalties, or fees are charged.
*   Income-Based Access: The amount available to the user is strictly limited to wages they have already earned during the current pay period, ensuring no borrowing against future income.
*   Fee Structure: EWA services charge no interest and instead charge a low, flat fee or a percentage based transaction fee for usage. A reasonable fee would be minimal and transparent, reflecting the actual cost of providing the service without burdening the user, likely in the range of $1–$5 per transaction or 1–5% of the advance.
*   No Debt Creation: EWA services typically do not report transactions to credit bureaus, ensuring they do not impact the user’s credit score or contribute to long-term debt accumulation.

Apps that provide personal loans, including but not limited to apps which offer loans directly, lead generators, and those who connect consumers with third-party lenders, must have the App Category set to “Finance” in Play Console and disclose the following information in the app metadata:

*   Minimum and maximum period for repayment.
*   Maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which generally includes interest rate plus fees and other costs for a year, or similar other rate calculated consistently with local law.
*   A representative example of the total cost of the loan, including the principal and all applicable fees.
*   A privacy policy that comprehensively discloses the access, collection, use, and sharing of personal and sensitive user data, subject to the restrictions outlined in this policy.

We do not allow apps that promote personal loans which require repayment in full in 60 days or less from the date the loan is issued (we refer to these as "short-term personal loans").

Apps that provide Earned Wage Access loans, including but not limited to apps which offer these loans directly, lead generators, and those who connect consumers with third-party lenders, must have the app category set to “Finance” in Play Console and disclose the following information in the app metadata:

*   Repayment terms and conditions
*   All fees, including subscription fees, transaction fees, and all other fees related to providing the loan.
*   A representative example of the total cost of the loan, including all fees.
*   A privacy policy that comprehensively discloses the access, collection, use, and sharing of personal and sensitive user data, subject to the restrictions outlined in this policy.

We must be able to establish a connection between your developer account and any provided licenses or documentation proving your ability to service personal loans. Additional information or documents may be requested to confirm your account is in compliance with all local laws and regulations.

Personal loan apps, apps with the primary purpose of facilitating access to personal loans (for example, lead generators or facilitators) or lines of credit, accessory loan or credit apps (loan calculators, loan guides, etc.), and Earned Wage Access (EWA) apps are prohibited from accessing sensitive data, such as photos and contacts. The following permissions are prohibited:

*   Read\_external\_storage
*   Read\_media\_images
*   Read\_contacts
*   Access\_fine\_location
*   Read\_phone\_numbers
*   Read\_media\_videos
*   Query\_all\_packages
*   Write\_external\_storage

Apps that utilize sensitive information or APIs are subject to additional restrictions and requirements. Please see the [Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888170) for additional information.

#### **High APR personal loans**

In the United States, we do not allow apps for personal loans where the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is 36% or higher. Apps for personal loans in the United States must display their maximum APR, calculated consistently with the [Truth in Lending Act (TILA)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr1026_main_02.tpl).

This policy applies to apps which offer loans directly, lead generators, and those who connect consumers with third-party lenders.

#### **Country specific requirements**

Personal loan apps targeting the listed countries must comply with additional requirements and provide supplementary documentation as part of the Financial features declaration within [Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/app/app-content/finance-declaration). Apps that provide EWA loans are subject to these requirements to the extent applicable in the relevant jurisdictions. You must, upon Google Play's request, provide additional information or documents relating to your compliance with the applicable regulatory and licensing requirements.

#### Other Real-Money Games, Contests, and Tournament Apps

For all other apps which do not meet the eligibility requirements for gambling apps noted above and are not included in the “Other Real-Money Game Pilots” noted below, we don't allow content or services that enable or facilitate users’ ability to wager, stake, or participate using real money (including in-app items purchased with money) to obtain a prize of real world monetary value. This includes but is not limited to, online casinos, sports betting, lotteries, and games that accept money and offer prizes of cash or other real world value (except programs permitted under the Gamified Loyalty Programs requirements described below).

#### Examples of violations

*   Games that accept money in exchange for an opportunity to win a physical or monetary prize
*   Apps that have navigational elements or features (for example, menu items, tabs, buttons, [webviews](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView), etc.) that provide a “call to action” to wager, stake, or participate in real-money games, contests or tournaments using real money, such as apps that invite users to “BET!” or “REGISTER!” or “COMPETE!” in a tournament for a chance to win a cash prize.
*   Apps that accept or manage wagers, in-app currencies, winnings, or deposits in order to gamble for, or obtain a physical or monetary prize.

#### Other Real-Money Game Pilots

We may occasionally conduct limited time pilots for certain types of real money gaming in select regions. For details, refer to this [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12918670) page. The Online Crane Games pilot in Japan ended on July 11, 2023. Effective July 12, 2023, Online Crane Game apps may be listed on Google Play globally subject to applicable law and certain [requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12002615).

#### Gamified Loyalty Programs

Where permitted by law and not subject to additional gambling or gaming licensing requirements, we allow loyalty programs that reward users with real world prizes or monetary equivalent, subject to the following Play Store eligibility requirements:

#### For all apps ([games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/GAME) and non-games):

*   Loyalty program benefits, perks, or rewards must be clearly supplementary and subordinate to any qualifying monetary transaction within the app (where the qualifying monetary transaction must be a genuine separate transaction to provide goods or services independent of the loyalty program) and may not be subject to purchase nor tied to any mode of exchange otherwise in violation of the Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy restrictions.
    *   For example, no portion of the qualifying monetary transaction may represent a fee or wager to participate in the loyalty program, and the qualifying monetary transaction must not result in the purchase of goods or services above its usual price.

#### For [Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/GAME) apps:

*   Loyalty points or rewards with benefits, perks or rewards associated with a qualifying monetary transaction may only be awarded and redeemed on a fixed ratio basis, where the ratio is documented conspicuously in the app and also within the publicly available official rules for the program, and the earning of benefits or redemptive value may **not** be wagered, awarded or exponentiated by game performance or chance-based outcomes.

#### For non-Game apps:

*   Loyalty points or rewards may be tied to a contest or chance based outcomes if they fulfill the requirements noted below. Loyalty programs with benefits, perks or rewards associated with a qualifying monetary transaction must:
    *   Publish official rules for the program within the app.
    *   For programs involving variable, chance-based, or randomized reward systems: disclose within the official terms for the program 1) the odds for any reward programs which use fixed odds to determine rewards and 2) the selection method (for example, variables used to determine the reward) for all other such programs.
    *   Specify a fixed number of winners, fixed entry deadline, and prize award date, per promotion, within the official terms of a program offering drawings, sweepstakes, or other similar style promotions.
    *   Document any fixed ratio for loyalty point or loyalty reward accrual and redemption conspicuously in the app and also within the official terms of the program.

User Generated Content
======================

User-generated content (UGC) is content that users contribute to an app, and which is visible to or accessible by at least a subset of the app's users.

Apps that contain or feature UGC, including apps which are specialized browsers or clients to direct users to a UGC platform, must implement robust, effective, and ongoing UGC moderation that:

*   Requires users accept the app's terms of use and/or user policy before users can create or upload UGC;
*   Defines objectionable content and behaviors (in a way that complies with Google Play Developer Program Policies), and prohibits them in the app’s terms of use or user policies;
*   Conducts UGC moderation, as is reasonable and consistent with the type of UGC hosted by the app. This includes providing an in-app system for reporting and blocking objectionable UGC and users, and taking action against UGC or users where appropriate. Different UGC experiences may require different moderation efforts. For example:
    *   Apps featuring UGC that identify a specified set of users through means such as user verification or offline registration (for example, apps exclusively used within a specific school or company, etc.) must provide in-app functionality to report content and users.
    *   UGC features that enable 1:1 user interaction with specific users (for example, direct messaging, tagging, mentioning, etc.) must provide an in-app functionality for blocking users.
    *   Apps that provide access to publicly accessible UGC, such as social networking apps and blogger apps, must implement in-app functionality to report users and content, and to block users.
    *   In the case of augmented reality (AR) apps, UGC moderation (including the in-app reporting system) must account for both objectionable AR UGC (for example, a sexually explicit AR image) and sensitive AR anchoring location (for example, AR content anchored to a restricted area, such as a military base, or a private property where AR anchoring may cause issues for the property owner).
*   Provides safeguards to prevent in-app monetization from encouraging objectionable user behavior.

#### **Incidental Sexual Content**

Sexual content is considered “incidental” if it appears in a UGC app that (1) provides access to primarily non-sexual content, and (2) does not actively promote or recommend sexual content. Sexual content defined as illegal by applicable law and [child endangerment](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878809) content are not considered “incidental” and are not permitted.

UGC apps may contain incidental sexual content if all of the following requirements are met:

*   Such content is hidden by default behind filters that require at least two user actions in order to completely disable (for example, behind an obfuscating interstitial or precluded from view by default unless “safe search” is disabled).
*   Children, as defined in the [Families policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335), are explicitly prohibited from accessing your app using age screening systems such as a [neutral age screen](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9867159?visit_id=637661037575013539-1915084824&rd=1#neutral-agescreen) or an appropriate system as defined by applicable law.
*   Your app provides accurate responses to the content rating questionnaire regarding UGC, as required by the [Content Ratings policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9898843).

Apps whose primary purpose is featuring objectionable UGC will be removed from Google Play. Similarly, apps that end up being used primarily for hosting objectionable UGC, or that develop a reputation among users of being a place where such content thrives, will also be removed from Google Play.

Examples of common violations

*   Promoting sexually explicit user-generated content, including implementing or permitting paid features that principally encourage the sharing of objectionable content.
*   Apps with user generated content (UGC) that lack sufficient safeguards against threats, harassment, or bullying, particularly toward minors.
*   Posts, comments, or photos within an app that are primarily intended to harass or single out another person for abuse, malicious attack, or ridicule.
*   Apps that continually fail to address user complaints about objectionable content.

Blockchain-based Content
========================

As blockchain technology continues to rapidly evolve, we aim to provide a platform for developers to thrive with innovation and build more enriched, immersive experiences for users.

For the purposes of this policy, we consider blockchain-based content to be tokenized digital assets secured on a blockchain. If your app contains blockchain-based content, you must comply with these requirements.

#### Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Software Wallets

The purchase, holding, or exchange of cryptocurrencies should be conducted through certified services in regulated jurisdictions.

You must also comply with applicable regulations for any region or country that your app targets and avoid publishing your app where your products and services are prohibited. Google Play may request you to provide additional information or documents regarding your compliance with any applicable regulatory or licensing requirements.

To learn more about country-specific requirements, please review this [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16329703) article.

#### Cryptomining

We don't allow apps that mine cryptocurrency on devices. We permit apps that remotely manage the mining of cryptocurrency.

#### Transparency Requirements for Distributing Tokenized Digital Assets

If your app sells or enables users to earn Tokenized Digital Assets, you must declare this via the Financial features declaration form on the App Content page in Play Console.

When creating an in-app product, you must indicate in the product details that it represents a Tokenized Digital Asset. For additional guidance, see [Create an in-app product](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/1153481).

You may not promote or glamorize any potential earning from playing or trading activities.

#### Additional Requirements for NFT Gamification

As required by Google Play’s [Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032), gambling apps that integrate tokenized digital assets, such as NFTs, should complete the application process.

For all other apps which do not meet the eligibility requirements for gambling apps and are not included in [Other Real-Money Game Pilots](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032#rmg-pilots), anything of monetary value should not be accepted in exchange for a chance to obtain an NFT of unknown value. NFTs bought by users should be consumed or used in the game to enhance a user’s experience or aid users in advancing the game. NFTs must not be used to wager or stake in exchange for the opportunity to win prizes of real-world monetary value (including other NFTs).

Examples of violations

*   Apps that sell bundles of NFTs without disclosing the specific contents and values of the NFTs.
*   Pay-to-play social casino games, such as slot machines, that reward NFTs.

AI-Generated Content
====================

As generative AI models become more widely available to developers, you may be incorporating these models into your apps to increase engagement and improve user experience. Google Play wants to help ensure that AI-generated content is safe for all users and that user feedback is incorporated to enable responsible innovation.

#### **AI-Generated Content**

AI-generated content is content that is created by generative AI models based on user prompts. Examples of AI-generated content include:

*   Text–to-text conversational generative AI chatbots, in which interacting with the chatbot is a central feature of the app
*   Image or video generated by AI based on text, image, or voice prompts

To ensure user safety and in accordance with Google Play’s [Policy Coverage](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10146128), apps that generate content using AI must comply with existing Google Play Developer Policies, including by prohibiting and preventing the generation of [Restricted Content](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877466), such as [content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878809), and content that enables [Deceptive Behavior](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888077).

For resources on industry best practices in safeguarding generative AI apps, please see our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16353813) article.

Apps that generate content using AI must contain in-app user reporting or flagging features that allow users to report or flag offensive content to developers without needing to exit the app. Developers should utilize user reports to inform content filtering and moderation in their apps.

Device and Network Abuse
========================

_**Disclaimer:** Policy summaries and Key Considerations are overviews only; always refer to the full policy for compliance. The full policy takes precedence in case of conflict._

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

Google Play prohibits your app (or any third-party SDKs in your app) from unauthorized access or interference with the user's device, other devices, network, API, or service, other apps on the device, any Google service, or an authorized carrier’s network. This encompasses a range of harmful, high risk, or disruptive behaviors, such as performing self-updates outside the Play Store, downloading unauthorized executable code, exploiting security vulnerabilities, facilitating hacking, or creating game cheats that affect other apps. Protecting the integrity of the user's device and the broader ecosystem is paramount. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

We don’t allow apps that interfere with, disrupt, damage, or access in an unauthorized manner the user’s device, other devices or computers, servers, networks, application programming interfaces (APIs), or services, including but not limited to other apps on the device, any Google service, or an authorized carrier’s network.

Apps on Google Play must comply with the default Android system optimization requirements documented in the [Core App Quality guidelines for Google Play](http://developer.android.com/distribute/essentials/quality/core.html#listing).

An app distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself using any method other than Google Play's update mechanism. Likewise, an app may not download executable code (such as dex, JAR, .so files) from a source other than Google Play. This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine or an interpreter where either provides indirect access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a webview or browser).

Apps or third-party code, like SDKs, with interpreted languages (JavaScript, Python, Lua, etc.) loaded at run time (for example, not packaged with the app) must not allow potential violations of Google Play policies.

We don’t allow code that introduces or exploits security vulnerabilities. Check out the [App Security Improvement Program](https://developer.android.com/google/play/asi.html#campaigns) to find out about the most recent security issues flagged to developers.

#### Examples of common Device and Network Abuse violations:

*   Apps that block or interfere with another app displaying ads.
*   Game cheating apps that affect the gameplay of other apps.
*   Apps that facilitate or provide instructions on how to hack services, software or hardware, or circumvent security protections.
*   Apps that access or use a service or API in a manner that violates its terms of service.
*   Apps that are not [eligible for allowlisting](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#whitelisting-cases) and attempt to bypass [system power management](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html).
*   Apps that facilitate proxy services to third parties may only do so in apps where that is the primary, user-facing core purpose of the app.
*   Apps or third party code (for example, SDKs) that download executable code, such as dex files or native code, from a source other than Google Play.
*   Apps that install other apps on a device without the user's prior consent.
*   Apps that link to or facilitate the distribution or installation of malicious software.
*   Apps or third party code (for example, SDKs) containing a webview with added JavaScript Interface that loads untrusted web content (for example, http:// URL) or unverified URLs obtained from untrusted sources (for example, URLs obtained with untrusted Intents).
*   Apps that use the [full-screen intent permission](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/behavior-changes-14?hl=en#secure-fsi) to force user interaction with disruptive ads or notifications.
*   Apps that circumvent [Android sandbox protections](https://source.android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox) in order to derive user activity or user identity from other apps.

Permissions for Foreground Services (FGS)
-----------------------------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy Summary**  
The Foreground Service permission policy ensures user transparency, privacy, and optimal device performance.  For apps targeting Android 14+ you must declare valid Foreground Service (FGS) types in the manifest and Play Console, providing descriptions, user impact, and a demo video justifying their use based on user-initiated, perceptible actions. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

The Foreground Service permission ensures the appropriate use of user-facing foreground services. For apps targeting Android 14 and above, you must specify a valid foreground service type for each foreground service used in your app, and declare the [foreground service permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821) that is appropriate for that type. For example, if your app’s use case requires map geolocation, you must declare the [FOREGROUND\_SERVICE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION) permission in your app’s manifest.

Apps are only allowed to declare a foreground service permission if the use:

*   provides a feature that is beneficial to the user and relevant to the core functionality of the app
*   is initiated by the user or is user perceptible (for example, audio from playing a song, cast media to another device, accurate and clear user notification, user request to upload a photo to the cloud)
*   can be terminated or stopped by the user
*   can’t be interrupted or deferred by the system without causing a negative user experience or causing the user anticipated feature to not work as intended (for example, a phone call needs to start immediately and can’t be deferred by the system)
*   runs only for as long as necessary to complete the task

The following foreground service use cases are exempt from the above criteria:

*   foreground service types [systemExempted](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#system-exempted) or [shortService](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#short-service);
*   foreground service type dataSync only when using [Play Asset Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery) features

The use of foreground service is further explained [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821).

| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Run FGS only for as long as necessary to complete the task. | Don't use FGS if system management of your task doesn’t break the user experience in your app. Consider alternatives like WorkManager. |
| Ensure FGS provides a user-beneficial core app feature, is initiated by the user, is visible in notifications or is user perceptible (for example, audio from playing a song). | Don't declare invalid or inaccurate FGS types in your app’s manifest. |
| Submit a [declaration form](https://goo.gle/play-permission-decl-form) in your Play Console if targeting Android 14+ and describe the use case for each [Foreground Services (FGS)](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379?sjid=1631932611128229759-NC&visit_id=638822556734167291-4052248586&rd=1#foreground_service) permission used.

User-Initiated Data Transfer Jobs
---------------------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

To maintain user control and prevent prolonged background activity Google Play provides strict guidelines for Apps using the user-initiated data transfer jobs API. Data transfers must be directly prompted by the user, ensuring that the app executes a command rather than initiating transfers independently. These transfers are exclusively for network data transfer tasks and must only operate for the duration required to complete the requested action. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

Apps are only allowed to use the [user-initiated data transfer jobs](https://developer.android.com/partners/android-14/changes/user-initiated-data-transfers) API if the use is:

*   initiated by the user
*   for network data transfer tasks
*   runs only for as long as necessary to complete the data transfer

The usage of the user-initiated data transfer jobs API is further explained [here](https://developer.android.com/partners/android-14/changes/user-initiated-data-transfers).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |

Flag Secure Requirements
------------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

FLAG\_SECURE is an app-declared display flag indicating sensitive data in the UI should be limited to secure surfaces, preventing screenshots and non-secure display viewing and capturing. Developers use this when content shouldn't be broadcast or viewed outside the app/device. Google Play requires all apps to respect other apps' FLAG\_SECURE declarations and not bypass them for security and privacy. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

[FLAG\_SECURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_SECURE) is a display flag declared in an app’s code to indicate that its UI contains sensitive data intended to be limited to a secure surface while using the app. This flag is designed to prevent the data from appearing in screenshots or from being viewed on non-secure displays. Developers declare this flag when the app’s content should not be broadcast, viewed, or otherwise transmitted outside of the app or users’ device.

For security and privacy purposes, all apps distributed on Google Play are required to respect the FLAG\_SECURE declaration of other apps. Meaning, apps must not facilitate or create workarounds to bypass the FLAG\_SECURE settings in other apps.

Apps that qualify as an [Accessibility Tool](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491?hl=en) are exempt from this requirement, as long as they do not transmit, save, or cache FLAG\_SECURE protected content for access outside of the user's device.

Apps that Run On-device Android Containers
------------------------------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

To prevent security and privacy concerns, developers can use a \`REQUIRE\_SECURE\_ENV\` flag in their app manifest when on-device Android container apps lack the full security features of Android OS.  The flag indicates the app should not run in a simulated environment. Apps providing these containers are required to respect this flag by not loading apps that declare it and are prohibited from bypassing this security measure. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

On-device Android container apps provide environments that simulate whole or portions of an underlying Android OS. The experience within these environments may not reflect the full suite of [Android security features](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features), which is why developers can choose to add a secure environment manifest flag to communicate to on-device Android containers that they must not operate in their simulated Android environment.

**Secure Environment Manifest Flag**

[REQUIRE\_SECURE\_ENV](https://d.android.com/training/basics/intents/limit-play-loading) is a flag that can be declared in an app’s manifest to indicate that this app must not run in on-device Android container apps. For security and privacy purposes, apps that provide on-device Android containers must respect all apps that declare this flag and:

*   Review the manifests of apps they intend to load in their on-device Android container for this flag.
*   Not load the apps that declared this flag into their on-device Android container.
*   Not function as a proxy by intercepting or calling APIs on the device so that they appear to be installed in the container.
*   Not facilitate, or create workarounds to bypass the flag (such as, loading an older version of an app to bypass the current app’s REQUIRE\_SECURE\_ENV flag).

Learn more about this policy in our [Help Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13609005).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Apps that provide on-device containers must check for the `REQUIRE_SECURE_ENV` flag in other apps' manifests and not load them. | Don't ignore the flag. You cannot load an app into your container if it declares the `REQUIRE_SECURE_ENV` flag. |
| Avoid workarounds. You are prohibited from bypassing the flag, such as by loading older versions of an app. | Don't bypass security measures. Do not create workarounds to override an app's security preference. |
| Avoid proxying APIs. Do not function as a proxy by intercepting or calling APIs outside the container. | Don't make it appear that apps are running in a secure environment when they are not. |

Malware
=======

_**Disclaimer:** Policy summaries and Key Considerations are overviews only; always refer to the full policy for compliance. The full policy takes precedence in case of conflict._

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

To maintain a safe Android ecosystem, Google Play prohibits any malicious code, including third-party SDKs integrated into apps, that could put users, their data, or their devices at risk. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

Our Malware policy is simple, the Android ecosystem including the Google Play store, and user devices should be free from malicious behaviors (for example, malware). Through this fundamental principle we strive to provide a safe Android ecosystem for our users and their Android devices.

 Malware is any code that could put a user, a user's data, or a device at risk. Malware includes, but is not limited to, Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs), binaries, or framework modifications, consisting of categories such as trojans, phishing, and spyware apps, and we are continuously updating and adding new categories.

The requirements of this policy also apply to any third party code (for example, an SDK) that you include in your app.

Though varied in type and capabilities, malware usually has one of the following objectives:

*   Compromise the integrity of the user's device.
*   Gain control over a user's device.
*   Enable remote-controlled operations for an attacker to access, use, or otherwise exploit an infected device.
*   Transmit personal data or credentials off the device without adequate disclosure and consent.
*   Disseminate spam or commands from the infected device to affect other devices or networks.
*   Defraud the user.

An app, binary, or framework modification can be potentially harmful, and therefore can generate malicious behavior, even if wasn't intended to be harmful. This is because apps, binaries, or framework modifications can function differently depending on a variety of variables. Therefore, what is harmful to one Android device might not pose a risk at all to another Android device. For example, a device running the latest version of Android is not affected by harmful apps which use deprecated APIs to perform malicious behavior but a device that is still running a very early version of Android might be at risk. Apps, binaries, or framework modifications are flagged as malware or PHA if they clearly pose a risk to some or all Android devices and users.

The malware categories, below, reflect our foundational belief that users should understand how their device is being leveraged and promote a secure ecosystem that enables robust innovation and a trusted user experience.

Visit [Google Play Protect](https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect/potentially-harmful-applications) for more information.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Thoroughly vet all code in your app, including third-party SDKs, to ensure they do not exhibit malware-like behaviors such as spyware, trojans, or phishing, even unintentionally. | Integrate code that abuses elevated privileges to compromise system integrity, roots devices without explicit user consent and awareness, or employs maskware techniques to evade detection of malicious behavior. |
| Consider using tools to check for security vulnerabilities or backdoors that enable unwanted remote operations. | Use third-party SDKs that collect and transmit personal data for monitoring without proper user disclosure and consent (i.e. stalkerware). Incorporate code that will cause deceptive billing practices involving SMS, calls, or toll fraud. |
| Ensure third-party SDKs don’t collect and/or exfiltrate user data without policy-compliant functionality and/or adequate notice or consent (Spyware). | Use third-party SDKs that perform Denial of Service attacks or act as a Hostile Downloader. |
| Ensure your app does not include third-party SDKs that violate the Android permissions model by gaining elevated privileges through the access of device data for an undisclosed purpose. |     |

Backdoors
---------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

To protect your users, you must remove any code that acts as a backdoor, which is defined as code facilitating unwanted or harmful remote-controlled operations. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

Code that allows the execution of unwanted, potentially harmful, remote-controlled operations on a device.

These operations may include behavior that would place the app, binary, or framework modification into one of the other malware categories if executed automatically. In general, backdoor is a description of how a potentially harmful operation can occur on a device and is therefore not completely aligned with categories like billing fraud or commercial spyware. As a result, a subset of backdoors, under some circumstances, are treated by Google Play Protect as a vulnerability.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Thoroughly test your app's code and all third-party libraries for hidden remote control capabilities. | Don't include hidden features or capabilities that could be exploited to harm users. |
| Secure all remote execution endpoints against unauthorized access. | Don't obfuscate code to hide remote access functionality. |
| Patch known security vulnerabilities in your app immediately. | Don’t ignore warnings about potential vulnerabilities in your dependencies. |

Billing Fraud
-------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

To avoid billing fraud, you must remove any code that deceptively charges users without their explicit consent. This includes SMS fraud, Call fraud, and Toll fraud, which trick users into unwanted payments or subscriptions. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

Code that automatically charges the user in an intentionally deceptive way.

Mobile billing fraud is divided into SMS fraud, Call fraud, and Toll fraud.

_SMS Fraud_  
Code that charges users to send premium SMS without consent, or tries to disguise its SMS activities by hiding disclosure agreements or SMS messages from the mobile operator notifying the user of charges or confirming subscriptions.

Some code, even though they technically disclose SMS sending behavior, introduce additional behavior that accommodates SMS fraud. Examples include hiding parts of a disclosure agreement from the user, making them unreadable, and conditionally suppressing SMS messages from the mobile operator informing the user of charges or confirming a subscription.

_Call Fraud_  
Code that charges users by making calls to premium numbers without user consent.

_Toll Fraud_  
Code that tricks users into subscribing to or purchasing content via their mobile phone bill.

Toll Fraud includes any type of billing except premium SMS and premium calls. Examples of this include direct carrier billing, wireless application protocol (WAP), and mobile airtime transfer. WAP fraud is one of the most prevalent types of Toll fraud. WAP fraud can include tricking users to click a button on a silently loaded, transparent WebView. Upon performing the action, a recurring subscription is initiated, and the confirmation SMS or email is often hijacked to prevent users from noticing the financial transaction.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Obtain explicit and unambiguous consent from users before initiating any financial transactions. | Don't hide or disguise any information related to charges or subscriptions. |
| Ensure all billing disclosures are clear, transparent, and prominently visible to the user. | Don't use hidden web views, or automatically send premium SMS messages or make calls without consent. |
| Send all carrier billing notifications through to the user | Don't use methods like direct carrier billing to trick users into subscriptions. |

Apps must provide adequate prominent disclosure and obtain consent as required by the [User Data policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?hl=en).

**Guidelines for Monitoring Applications**

Apps exclusively designed and marketed for monitoring another individual, for example parents to monitor their children or enterprise management for the monitoring of individual employees, provided they fully comply with the requirements described below are the only acceptable monitoring apps. These apps cannot be used to track anyone else (a spouse, for example) even with their knowledge and permission, regardless if persistent notification is displayed. These apps must use the IsMonitoringTool metadata flag in their manifest file to appropriately designate themselves as monitoring apps.

Monitoring apps must comply with these requirements:

*   Apps must not present themselves as a spying or secret surveillance solution.
*   Apps must not hide or cloak tracking behavior or attempt to mislead users about such functionality.
*   Apps must present users with a persistent notification at all times when the app is running and a unique icon that clearly identifies the app.
*   Apps must disclose monitoring or tracking functionality in the Google Play store description.
*   Apps and app listings on Google Play must not provide any means to activate or access functionality that violate these terms, such as linking to a non-compliant APK hosted outside Google Play.
*   Apps must comply with any applicable laws. You are solely responsible for determining the legality of your app in its targeted locale.

Hostile Downloaders
-------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy Summary**

Google Play prohibits "hostile downloaders"—apps that download other Mobile Unwanted Software (MUwS). An app is flagged as a hostile downloader if it's believed to be designed to spread MUwS or if at least 5% of its downloads are determined to be MUwS. This policy does not apply to major browsers or file-sharing apps, as long as they only download software with the user's explicit consent and initiation. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

Code that isn't in itself potentially harmful, but downloads other PHAs.

Code may be a hostile downloader if:

*   There is reason to believe it was created to spread PHAs and it has downloaded PHAs or contains code that could download and install apps; or
*   At least 5% of apps downloaded by it are PHAs with a minimum threshold of 500 observed app downloads (25 observed PHA downloads).

Major browsers and file-sharing apps aren't considered hostile downloaders as long as:

*   They don't drive downloads without user interaction; and
*   All PHA downloads are initiated by consenting users.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Provide clear notice and obtain explicit user consent before any data collection or transmission. | Allow third-party SDKs in your app to record audio, calls, or obtain app data without explicit user consent and policy-compliant functionality. |
| Implement robust logging and auditing for all third-party SDKs data access and transmission to detect and address unauthorized data exfiltration. | Engage in hidden data collection, or collect more data than the app needs for its stated function. |
| Ensure SDKs integrated in your app only collect the minimum necessary data and that its purpose or behavior doesn’t cause your app to violate Google Play policies. | Include third-party SDKs in your app that transmit data in unexpected ways or without proper consent. |
|     | Assume third-party SDKs in your app data collection practices are compliant without your thorough review. |

Trojan
------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

A Trojan is code that contains a hidden, malicious component. This policy prohibits apps that perform undesirable actions against the user without their knowledge. As a developer, you must ensure your app's code is transparent and free of any hidden, harmful functionality. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

Code that appears to be benign, such as a game that claims only to be a game, but that performs undesirable actions against the user.

This classification is usually used in combination with other PHA categories. A trojan has an innocuous component and a hidden harmful component. For example, a game that sends premium SMS messages from the user's device in the background and without the user’s knowledge.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Ensure your app's code is transparent and serves its stated purpose. | Don't hide malicious functionality within a seemingly harmless app. |
| Confirm all app functionality is disclosed to the user. | Don't perform background actions without the user's explicit knowledge and consent. |
| Be certain any included third-party SDKs are safe and do not contain hidden behaviors. | Don't misrepresent your app's purpose to trick users. |

* * *

A Note on Uncommon Apps
-----------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

If Google Play Protect lacks sufficient information to verify your new app's safety, it may be classified as "uncommon." This status doesn't mean your app is harmful, but that it needs further review. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

New and rare apps can be classified as uncommon if Google Play Protect doesn't have enough information to clear them as safe. This doesn't mean the app is necessarily harmful, but without further review it can't be cleared as safe either.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Provide complete and accurate information in your app listing. | Don't hide functionality or use obfuscated code. |
| Ensure your app's code is clean and well-documented for review. | Don't use unverified third-party libraries. |

A Note on the Backdoor Category
-------------------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

A backdoor is code that enables malicious behavior. If dynamic code loading is used to perform harmful actions, your app will be in violation. You must ensure your app’s code does not enable any hidden, malicious functionality. If a vulnerability is found without malicious intent, you will be asked to patch it. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

The backdoor malware category classification relies on how the code acts. A necessary condition for any code to be classified as a backdoor is that it enables behavior that would place the code into one of the other malware categories if executed automatically. For example, if an app allows dynamic code loading and the dynamically loaded code is extracting text messages, it will be classified as a backdoor malware.

However, if an app allows arbitrary code execution and we don’t have any reason to believe that this code execution was added to perform a malicious behaviour then the app will be treated as having a vulnerability, rather than being backdoor malware, and the developer will be asked to patch it.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Rigorously test any code that enables dynamic execution. | Don't use dynamic code loading to perform hidden, malicious actions. |
| Ensure your app's code is free from vulnerabilities that could be exploited. | Don't allow arbitrary code execution without careful security checks. |
| Promptly patch any security vulnerabilities found in your app. | Don't use unverified third-party libraries that could enable a backdoor. |

Riskware
--------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

Riskware is an app that uses evasion techniques to hide malicious functionality. It masks itself as a legitimate app, using methods like obfuscation or dynamic code loading to reveal harmful content later. You must ensure your app is transparent and does not use such techniques to deceive reviewers or users. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9vOsGjf1MLJLdX41RAT7hMOW0TMAPDdE0cJD) **Full Policy**

An application that utilizes a variety of evasion techniques in order to serve the user different, or fake, application functionality. These apps mask themselves as legitimate applications or games to appear innocuous to app stores and users and use techniques such as obfuscation, dynamic code loading, or cloaking to reveal potentially harmful content.

Riskware is similar to other PHA categories, specifically Trojan, with the main difference being the techniques used to obfuscate the malicious activity.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Ensure your app's code is clear and easy to review. | Don't use obfuscation or cloaking to hide functionality. |
| Be transparent about all of your app's functions. | Don't use dynamic code loading to serve malicious content. |
| Disclose all functionality in the app description. | Don't make your app's behavior different for reviewers versus regular users. |

Impersonation
=============

We don’t allow apps that mislead users by impersonating someone else (for example, another developer, company, entity) or another app. Don’t imply that your app is related to or authorized by someone that it isn’t. Be careful not to use app icons, descriptions, titles, or in-app elements that could mislead users about your app’s relationship to someone else or another app.

Examples of common violations
-----------------------------

*   Developers that falsely imply a relationship to another company / developer / entity / organization.
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CTXDDQ5617TOtJ7SXt26hSid4qUaq_sXHYsOkRikG_I5irsQ3Qh8Y5vmcu9Nr8wYEg=w600-h1100)
    
    ① The developer name listed for this app suggests an official relationship with Google, even though such a relationship doesn’t exist.

Mobile Unwanted Software
========================

_**Disclaimer:** Policy summaries and Key Considerations are overviews only; always refer to the full policy for compliance. The full policy takes precedence in case of conflict._

Mobile Unwanted Software
------------------------

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

To ensure a safe and great user experience, this policy builds on the Google [Unwanted Software Policy](https://www.google.com/about/unwanted-software-policy.html) by outlining principles for the [Android ecosystem](https://www.android.com/mobile-unwanted-software-policy/) and the Google Play Store. Apps that violate these principles are potentially harmful to the user experience and we will take actions to protect users from them. Your app must deliver its promised value, be transparent about its functions and clearly disclose any bundled software. It must not misrepresent the device’s state, impersonate others or generate fake ad traffic. You must handle all user data securely and in compliance with our [User Data](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?visit_id=638967622926708071-1089367679&rd=1) policies. Apps that interfere with device usability, show disruptive ads or mimic system prompts are prohibited. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

At Google, we believe that if we focus on the user, all else will follow. In our [Software Principles](https://www.google.com/about/software-principles.html) and the [Unwanted Software policy](https://www.google.com/about/unwanted-software-policy.html), we provide general recommendations for software that delivers a great user experience. This policy builds on the Google Unwanted Software policy by outlining principles for the [Android ecosystem](https://www.android.com/mobile-unwanted-software-policy) and the Google Play store. Software that violates these principles is potentially harmful to the user experience, and we will take steps to protect users from it.

As mentioned in the [Unwanted Software policy](https://www.google.com/about/unwanted-software-policy.html), we’ve found that most unwanted software displays one or more of the same basic characteristics:

*   It is deceptive, promising a value proposition that it does not meet.
*   It tries to trick users into installing it or it piggybacks on the installation of another program.
*   It doesn’t tell the user about all of its principal and significant functions.
*   It affects the user’s system in unexpected ways.
*   It collects or transmits private information without users’ knowledge.
*   It collects or transmits private information without a secure handling (for example, transmission over HTTPS)
*   It is bundled with other software and its presence is not disclosed.

On mobile devices, software is code in the form of an app, binary, framework modification, etc. In order to prevent software that is harmful to the software ecosystem or disruptive to the user experience we will take action on code that violates these principles.

Below, we build on the Unwanted Software policy to extend its applicability to mobile software. As with that policy, we will continue to refine this Mobile Unwanted Software policy to address new types of abuse.

**Transparent behavior and clear disclosures**

_All code should deliver on promises made to the user. Apps should provide all communicated functionality. Apps should not confuse users._

*   Apps should be clear about the functionality and objectives.
*   Explicitly and clearly explain to the user what system changes will be made by the app. Allow users to review and approve all significant installation options and changes.
*   Software should not misrepresent the state of the user’s device to the user, for example by claiming the system is in a critical security state or infected with viruses.
*   Don’t utilize invalid activity designed to increase ad traffic and/or conversions.
*   We don’t allow apps that mislead users by impersonating someone else (for example, another developer, company, entity) or another app. Don’t imply that your app is related to or authorized by someone that it isn’t.

Example violations:

*   Ad fraud
*   Social Engineering

**Protect user data and privacy**

_Be clear and transparent about the access, use, collection, and sharing of personal and sensitive user data. Uses of user data must adhere to all relevant User Data policies, where applicable, and take all precautions to protect the data._

All apps must comply with all Google Play Developer Program Policies, including user and device data policies such as [User Data](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?sjid=3233661216398533600-NC), [Permissions and APIs that Access Sensitive Information](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888170?hl=en&ref_topic=9877467&sjid=3233661216398533600-NC), [Spyware](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888380?hl=en&ref_topic=9975838&sjid=15224346081630376820-EU#:~:text=email%20spam%20relay.-,Spyware,-Spyware%20is%20a), and [SDK Requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13323374?hl=en&ref_topic=9877467&sjid=3233661216398533600-NC).

*   Do not request or deceive users into turning off device security protections such as Google Play Protect. For example, you must not offer additional app features or rewards to users in exchange for turning off Google Play Protect.

**Do not harm the mobile experience**

_The user experience should be straightforward, easy-to-understand, and based on clear choices made by the user. It should present a clear value proposition to the user and not disrupt the advertised or desired user experience._

*   Don’t show ads that are displayed to users in unexpected ways including impairing or interfering with the usability of device functions, or displaying outside the triggering app’s environment without being easily dismissable and adequate consent and attribution.
*   Apps should not interfere with other apps or the usability of the device
*   Uninstall, where applicable, should be clear.
*   Mobile software should not mimic prompts from the device OS or other apps. Do not suppress alerts to the user from other apps or from the operating system, notably those which inform the user of changes to their OS.

Example violations:

*   Disruptive ads
*   Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality

Hostile Downloaders
===================

_**Disclaimer:** Policy summaries and Key Considerations are overviews only; always refer to the full policy for compliance. The full policy takes precedence in case of conflict._

### **Hostile Downloaders**

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

Google Play prohibits "hostile downloaders"—apps that download other Mobile Unwanted Software (MUwS). An app is flagged as a hostile downloader if it's believed to be designed to spread MUwS or if at least 5% of its downloads are determined to be MUwS. This policy does not apply to major browsers or file-sharing apps, as long as they only download software with the user's explicit consent and initiation. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

Code that isn't in itself unwanted software, but downloads other mobile unwanted software (MUwS).

Code may be a hostile downloader if:

*   There is reason to believe it was created to spread MUwS and it has downloaded MUwS or contains code that could download and install apps; or
*   At least 5% of apps downloaded by it are MUwS with a minimum threshold of 500 observed app downloads (25 observed MUwS downloads).

Major browsers and file-sharing apps aren't considered hostile downloaders as long as:

*   They don't drive downloads without user interaction; and
*   All software downloads are initiated by consenting users.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Ensure your app doesn’t include any code that spreads MUwS. | Don’t include any code in your app that spreads MUwS. |
| Monitor downloads to stay well below the 5% MUwS threshold. | Don’t Exceed the 5% MUwS threshold (25 MUwS per 500 downloads). |
| Ensure all app downloads are initiated by a consenting user, if your app's purpose is to download other files (like a browser or file-sharing). | Don’t include functionality that drives app downloads without explicit user interaction, if your app's purpose is to download other files (like a browser or file-sharing). |

Ad Fraud
========

_**Disclaimer:** Policy summaries and Key Considerations are overviews only; always refer to the full policy for compliance. The full policy takes precedence in case of conflict._

### Ad Fraud

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

To maintain the mobile ad ecosystem trust, Google Play strictly prohibits Ad Fraud, which is a form of [invalid traffic](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/3342054), and defined as any ad interaction that tricks an ad network into believing traffic is from real user interest. This includes showing hidden ads, auto-clicking ads, faking install attributions, showing ads outside the app, or misrepresenting your app's identity (like its package name or device type) to ad networks. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

Ad fraud is strictly prohibited. Ad interactions generated for the purpose of tricking an ad network into believing traffic is from authentic user interest is ad fraud, which is a form of [invalid traffic](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/3342054?hl=en&ref_topic=2745287). Ad fraud may be the byproduct of developers implementing ads in disallowed ways, such as showing hidden ads, automatically clicking ads, altering or modifying information and otherwise leveraging non-human actions (spiders, bots, etc.) or human activity designed to produce invalid ad traffic. Invalid traffic and ad fraud is harmful to advertisers, developers, and users, and leads to long-term loss of trust in the mobile Ads ecosystem.

Examples of common violations

*   An app that renders ads that are not visible to the user.
*   An app that automatically generates clicks on ads without the user's intention or that produces equivalent network traffic to fraudulently give click credits.
*   An app sending fake installation attribution clicks to get paid for installations that did not originate from the sender’s network.
*   An app that pops up ads when the user is not within the app interface.
*   False representations of the ad inventory by an app, for example, an app that communicates to ad networks that it is running on an iOS device when it is in fact running on an Android device; an app that misrepresents the package name that is being monetized.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Ensure all ads are visible to users and properly rendered within the app interface. | Don't render ads that are hidden, off-screen, or invisible to the user. |
| Ensure all ad clicks are a direct result of genuine, intentional user interactions. | Don't automatically generate clicks or use bots, scripts, or other non-human actions to create ad traffic. |
| Accurately represent your app's identity to ad networks, including its correct package name, device type (e.g., Android), and all ad inventory. | Don't implement ads in a way that tricks or incentivizes users into accidental clicks. |
| Ensure all traffic, clicks, and installation attributions are the result of authentic user interest. | Don't display ads (like pop-ups) when the user is not actively in your app. |

Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality
=====================================================

_**Disclaimer:** Policy summaries and Key Considerations are overviews only; always refer to the full policy for compliance. The full policy takes precedence in case of conflict._

### Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/mnzFjyenPky9CIQLLOjVINm80frPgduvyrWP)**Policy** **Summary**

Users trust system notifications and warnings to be timely, relevant, and important. Our policy protects this trust by prohibiting apps or ads from imitating or interfering with system functionality. Please review the full policy to ensure compliance.

We don’t allow apps or ads that mimic or interfere with system functionality, such as notifications or warnings. System level notifications may only be used for an app’s integral features, such as an airline app that notifies users of special deals, or a game that notifies users of in-game promotions.

Examples of common violations

*   Apps or ads that are delivered through a system notification or alert:
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/qm65Mxj1NoWF0Uby8ojiRLyf2O_0s5KCEghBcTswu-GP2WprEq08XZrcWKvfOzdJ25k=h1000)
    
    ① The system notification shown in this app is being used to serve an ad.

 

For additional examples involving ads, please refer to the [Ads policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753).

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/9B2Sqd9OZ9ln7qXLJLiNLhqLQTHRQZKDDRpa) **Key Considerations**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Do** | **Don't** |
| Use system notifications only for your app's integral features. | Don't mimic or interfere with system notifications or warnings. |
| Clearly attribute notifications to your app so users know the source. | Don’t trigger notifications to promote a different app or a third-party service. |
| Review the [Ads policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753) for more specific guidance on ad implementation. | Don’t create notifications or alerts that look like they are from the device’s operating system. |

③ The offer of the ad (promoting the download of a Mature app) is inappropriate for the content rating of the game app in which the ad was displayed (Everyone)

#### Families Ads Requirements

If you’re monetizing an app that targets children on Google Play, it’s important that your app follows the [Families Ads and Monetization Policy Requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335?hl=en&ref_topic=9877766&sjid=3024114548690050248-EU).

#### Deceptive Ads

Ads must not simulate or impersonate the user interface of any app feature, such as notifications or warning elements of an operating system. It must be clear to the user which app is serving each ad.

Examples of common violations

*   Ads that mimic an app's UI:
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/A3Y_qBYVWF2svMNxtSirEHSI-fW6gw0pZzASZgGFVthuyzpMH2nCZs9CMEr46Cg3rQ-_=w600-h1100)
    
    ① The question mark icon in this app is an ad that takes the user to an external landing page.
    
*   Ads that mimic a system notification:

    ① The example above illustrates a feature section that mimics other features but only leads the user to an ad or ads.
    

#### Disruptive Ads

Disruptive ads are ads that are displayed to users in unexpected ways, that may result in inadvertent clicks, or impairing or interfering with the usability of device functions.

Your app cannot force a user to click an ad or submit personal information for advertising purposes before they can fully use an app. Ads may only be displayed inside of the app serving them and must not interfere with other apps, ads, or the operation of the device, including system or device buttons and ports. This includes overlays, companion functionality, and widgetized ad units. If your app displays ads or other ads that interfere with normal use, they must be easily dismissible without penalty.

Examples of common violations

*   Ads that take up the entire screen or interfere with normal use and do not provide a clear means to dismiss the ad:
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/E0g8p7q4jqMMfYsn1OUnAi1Uogg5UsGXqStsTRdDPFCe3covkQl5CWOY4H2wcKaG0g=h1000)
    
    ① This ad does not have a dismiss button.
    
*   Ads that force the user to click-through by using a false dismiss button, or by making ads suddenly appear in areas of the app where the user usually taps for another function:
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ic6YPH3yIwN3IgvC0Ktcsq_mZTODpVUEHczJQkMj_r3qAZmuLio0VMdnOGTxe0ApGoI=h1000)
    
    ① This ad uses a false dismiss button.

    ② This ad suddenly appears in an area where the user is used to tapping for in-app functions.
    
*   Ads that display outside of the app serving them:
    
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/pvRi7rBu3Nfi2q8Pf4pj1fyCwaX5o7SnLtQU)
    
    ① The user navigates to the home screen from this app, and suddenly an ad appears on the homescreen.
    
*   Ads that are triggered by the home button or other features explicitly designed for exiting the app:
    
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/8lGGyFJs5DCTzYoyXID9gGCIPdWfpKmXzQzX)
    
    ① The user attempts to exit the app and navigate to the home screen, but instead, the expected flow is interrupted by an ad.
    

#### Better Ads Experiences

Developers are required to comply with the following ads guidelines to ensure high quality experiences for users when they are using Google Play apps. Your ads may not be shown in the following unexpected ways for users:

*   Full screen interstitial ads of all formats (video, GIF, static, etc.) that show unexpectedly, typically when the user has chosen to do something else, are not allowed. 
    *   Ads that appear during game play at the beginning of a level or during the beginning of a content segment are not allowed. 
    *   Full screen video interstitial ads that appear before an app’s loading screen (splash screen) are not allowed.
*   Full screen interstitial ads of all formats that are not closeable after 15 seconds are not allowed. Opt-in full screen interstitials or full screen interstitials that do not interrupt users in their actions (for example, after the score screen in a game app) may persist more than 15 seconds.

This policy does not apply to rewarded ads which are explicitly opted-in by users (for example, an ad that developers explicitly offer a user to watch in exchange for unlocking a specific game feature or a piece of content). This policy also does not apply to monetization and advertising that does not interfere with normal app use or game play (for example, video content with integrated ads, non-full screen banner ads).

These guidelines are inspired by the [Better Ads Standards - Mobile Apps Experiences](https://www.betterads.org/standards/#mobileapp) guidelines. For more information on Better Ads Standards, please refer to [Coalition of Better Ads](https://www.betterads.org/).

Examples of common violations

*   Unexpected ads that appear during game play or during the beginning of a content segment (for example, after a user has clicked on a button, and before the action intended by the button click has taken effect). These ads are unexpected for users, as users expect to begin a game or engage in content instead.  
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/rJ1QH4O7L9Y0M6oowyUp0lxJL4sYjhP0iUH7)  
    ① Unexpected static ad appears during game play at the beginning of a level.  
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/2w6koURCQNygQL43lkbCg3v6G8Nau8pdV46A)  
    ② Unexpected video ad appears during beginning of a content segment.
*   A full-screen ad that appears during game play and cannot be closed after 15 seconds.  
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/NBioy9uf8nqdAXXolKCR4q8u8EGxX02PSuwW)  
    ①  An interstitial ads appears during game play, and does not offer users an option to skip within 15 seconds.

#### Made for Ads

We don’t allow apps that display interstitial ads repeatedly to distract users from interacting with an app and performing in-app tasks.

Examples of common violations

*   Apps where an interstitial ad is placed after a user action (including but not limited to clicks, swipes, etc.) in a consecutive manner.
    
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/6N76HWDiB0xLD4mTNiQBkb6WozvInE0MffL9)
    
    ① The first in-app page has multiple buttons to interact with. When the user clicks **Start app** to use the app, an interstitial ad pops up. After the ad is closed, the user returns to the app and clicks **Service** to start using the service, but another interstitial ad appears.  
      
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/ewpzgReDq8OpLTyYmSJMp8Suu62UPpNYnC1D)
    
    ② On the first page, the user is led to click **Play** as it is the only button available to use the app. When the user clicks it, an interstitial ad shows up. After the ad is closed, the user clicks **Launch** as it is the only button to interact with, and another interstitial ad pops up.
    

#### Lockscreen Monetization

Unless the exclusive purpose of the app is that of a lockscreen, apps may not introduce ads or features that monetize the locked display of a device.

#### Ad Fraud

Ad fraud is strictly prohibited. For more information, refer to our [Ad Fraud policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9969955?hl=en&ref_topic=9969691).

#### Use of Location Data for Ads

Apps that extend usage of permission based device location data for serving ads are subject to the [Personal and Sensitive Information](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888076#personal_sensitive/) policy, and must also comply with the following requirements:

*   Use or collection of permission based device location data for advertising purposes must be clear to the user and documented in the app’s mandatory privacy policy, including linking to any relevant ad network privacy policies addressing location data use.
*   In accordance with [Location Permissions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888170#location_permissions/) requirements, location permissions may only be requested to implement current features or services within your app, and may not request device location permissions solely for the use of ads.

#### Usage of Android Advertising ID

Google Play Services version 4.0 introduced new APIs and an ID for use by advertising and analytics providers. Terms for the use of this ID are below.

*   **Usage**. The Android advertising identifier (AAID) must only be used for advertising and user analytics. The status of the “Opt out of Interest-based Advertising” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting must be verified on each access of the ID.
*   **Association with personally-identifiable information or other identifiers**.
    *   Advertising use: The advertising identifier may not be connected to persistent device Identifiers (for example: SSAID, MAC address, IMEI, etc.) for any advertising purpose. The advertising identifier may only be connected to personally-identifiable information with the explicit consent of the user.
    *   Analytics use: The advertising identifier may not be connected to personally-identifiable information or associated with any persistent device identifier (for example: SSAID, MAC address, IMEI, etc.) for any analytics purpose. Please read the [User Data policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?hl=en&ref_topic=9877467)for additional guidelines on persistent device identifiers.
*   **Respecting users' selections**.
    *   If reset, a new advertising identifier must not be connected to a previous advertising identifier or data derived from a previous advertising identifier without the explicit consent of the user.
    *   You must abide by a user’s “Opt out of Interest-based Advertising” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting. If a user has enabled this setting, you may not use the advertising identifier for creating user profiles for advertising purposes or for targeting users with personalized advertising. Allowed activities include contextual advertising, frequency capping, conversion tracking, reporting and security and fraud detection.
    *   On newer devices, when a user deletes the Android advertising identifier, the identifier will be removed. Any attempts to access the identifier will receive a string of zeros. A device without an advertising identifier must not be connected to data linked to or derived from a previous advertising identifier.
*   **Transparency to users**. The collection and use of the advertising identifier and commitment to these terms must be disclosed to users in a legally adequate privacy notification. To learn more about our privacy standards, please review our [User Data](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888076) policy.
*   **Abiding by the terms of use**. The advertising identifier may only be used in accordance with the Google Play Developer Program Policy, including by any party that you may share it with in the course of your business. All apps uploaded or published to Google Play must use the advertising ID (when available on a device) in lieu of any other device identifiers for any advertising purposes.

For more information, refer to our [User Data policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?hl=en&ref_topic=9877467&sjid=6999504764305276050-NA).

App Promotion
=============

We don’t allow apps that directly or indirectly engage in, or benefit from promotion practices (such as ads) that are deceptive or harmful to users or the developer ecosystem. Promotion practices are deceptive or harmful if their behavior or content violate our Developer Program Policies.

Examples of common violations
-----------------------------

*   Using [deceptive](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888077) ads on websites, apps, or other properties, including notifications that are similar to system notifications and alerts.
*   Using [sexually explicit](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878810) ads to direct users to your app’s Google Play listing for download.
*   Promotion or installation tactics that redirect users to Google Play or download apps without informed user action.
*   Unsolicited promotion via SMS services.
*   Text or image in the app title, icon, or developer name that indicate store performance or ranking, price or promotional information, or that suggests relations to existing Google Play programs.

It is your responsibility to ensure that any ad networks, affiliates, or ads associated with your app comply with these policies.

Metadata
========

Users depend on descriptions of your app to help them understand its functionality and purpose. We don't allow apps with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive, irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but not limited to the app's description, developer name, title, icon, screenshots, and promotional images. Developers must provide a clear and well-written description of their app. We also don't allow unattributed or anonymous user testimonials in the app's description.

Your app title, icon, and developer name are particularly helpful for users to find and learn about your app. Don’t use emojis, emoticons, or repeated special characters in these metadata elements. Avoid ALL CAPS unless it is part of your brand name. Misleading symbols in app icons are not allowed, for example: new message dot indicator when there are no new messages and download/install symbols when the app is not related to downloading content. Your app title must be 30 characters or less. Don’t use text or image in the app title, icon, or developer name that indicate store performance or ranking, price or promotional information, or that suggests relations to existing Google Play programs.

In addition to the requirements noted here, specific Google Play Developer Policies may require you to provide additional metadata information.

Examples of common violations

#### Here are some examples of inappropriate text, images, or videos within your listing:

*   Imagery or videos with sexually suggestive content. Avoid suggestive imagery containing breasts, buttocks, genitalia, or other fetishized anatomy or content, whether illustrated or real.
*   Using profane, vulgar, or other language that is inappropriate for a general audience in your app’s Store listing. 
*   Graphic violence prominently depicted in app icons, promotional images, or videos.
*   Depictions of the illicit usage of drugs. Even EDSA (Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic) content must be suitable for all audiences within the store listing.

#### Here are a few best practices:

*   Highlight what's great about your app. Share interesting and exciting facts about your app to help users understand what makes your app special.
*   Make sure that your app’s title and description accurately describe your app’s functionality.
*   Avoid using repetitive or unrelated keywords or references.
*   Keep your app’s description succinct and straightforward. Shorter descriptions tend to result in a better user experience, especially on devices with smaller displays. Excessive length, detail, improper formatting, or repetition can result in a violation of this policy.
*   Remember that your listing should be suitable for a general audience. Avoid using inappropriate text, images or videos in your listing and adhere to the guidelines above.

User Ratings, Reviews, and Installs
===================================

Developers must not attempt to manipulate the placement of any apps on Google Play. This includes, but is not limited to, inflating product ratings, reviews, or install counts by illegitimate means, such as fraudulent or incentivized reviews and ratings, or incentivizing users to install other apps as the app’s main functionality.

Examples of common violations in ratings and reviews
----------------------------------------------------

*   Asking users to rate your app while offering an incentive:
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/YE3Ni1kHIBr9NCMbR8MHb6d25GeqZSExgXpX7Mun7OQKn54asHNxDzkiAskdc4TLItQ=w600-h1100)  
        ① This notification offers users a discount in exchange for a high rating.  
     
*   Repeatedly submitting ratings posing as users to influence an app’s placement on Google Play.  
     
*   Submitting or encouraging users to submit reviews containing inappropriate content, including affiliates, coupons, game codes, email addresses, or links to websites or other apps:
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oinE3IemifnHTMi0UhqU9rz1H7Yti08fhcQpmUktbNdkMijfrcMn-SuceK4fOZjAUjM=w600-h1100)
    
        ② This review encourages users to promote the RescueRover app by making a coupon offer.
    

**Ratings and reviews are benchmarks of app quality. Users depend on them to be authentic and relevant. Here are some best practices when responding to user reviews:**

*   Keep your reply focused on the issues raised in the user's comments and don’t ask for a higher rating.  
     
*   Include references to helpful resources such as a support address or FAQ page.

News & Magazines
================

All News & Magazine apps must declare themselves in the Google Play Console and complete a self-declaration. 

A news & magazine app is an app that:

*   Declares itself as a "News" or “Magazine” app in the Google Play Console, or
*   Lists itself within the “News and Magazine” category on the Google Play store and describes itself as “news” or “magazine” in its app title, icon, developer name, or description.

For further guidance on what qualifies as a “News” or “Magazine” app, see [Requirements for news and news-related apps](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10523915).

In addition, News & Magazine apps must:

*   Provide the source of news & magazine articles including, but not limited to, the original publisher or author of each article.
*   Update regularly its content (no static content).
*   Provide users with clear and easy access to up-to-date contact information about the news & magazine app. 
*   Provide users with clear information about the publishing sources of third-party content (such as when provided by news & magazine aggregators apps). 
*   Provide users with an in-app content preview prior to purchase (if membership or subscription is required).
*   Not have affiliate marketing or ad revenue as its primary purpose.

Spam
====

We don't allow apps that spam users or Google Play, such as apps that send users unsolicited messages or apps that are repetitive or low-quality.

#### [COLLAPSE ALL](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9899034) [EXPAND ALL](#1&2&3&4&5&6&7&87&9)

#### Message Spam

We don’t allow apps that send SMS, email, or other messages on behalf of the user without giving the user the ability to confirm the content and intended recipients.

Examples of common violations

*   When the user presses the ‘Share’ button, the app sent messages on the user’s behalf without giving them the ability to confirm the content and intended recipients:  
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ba4qjNQZ7-IgV4QhGps-OVgNA7cQpgWRb348SxYlgw05cv3tZqFvrNrNlYuzku88Z788=h839)

#### Webviews and Affiliate Spam

We don’t allow apps whose primary purpose is to drive affiliate traffic to a website or provide a webview of a website without permission from the website owner or administrator.

Examples of common violations

*   An app whose primary purpose is to drive referral traffic to a website to receive credit for user sign-ups or purchases on that website.
*   Apps whose primary purpose is to provide a webview of a website without permission:

         ① This app is called “Ted’s Shopping Deals” and it simply provides a webview of Google Shopping.
    

#### Repetitive Content

We don't allow apps that merely provide the same experience as other apps already on Google Play. Apps should provide value to users through the creation of unique content or services.

Examples of common violations

*   Copying content from other apps without adding any original content or value.
*   Creating multiple apps with highly similar functionality, content, and user experience. If these apps are each small in content volume, developers should consider creating a single app that aggregates all the content.

Functionality, Content, and User Experience
===========================================

Apps should provide a stable, responsive, and engaging user experience. Apps that crash, do not have the basic degree of adequate utility as mobile apps, lack engaging content, or exhibit other behavior that is not consistent with a functional and engaging user experience are not allowed on Google Play.

Google Play Families Policies
=============================

The use of technology as a tool for enriching families' lives continues to grow, and parents are looking for safe, high-quality content to share with their children. You may be designing your apps specifically for children or your app may just attract their attention. Google Play wants to help you make sure your app is safe for all users, including families.

The word "children" can mean different things in different locales and in different contexts. It is important that you consult with your legal counsel to help determine what obligations and/or age-based restrictions may apply to your app. You know best how your app works so we are relying on you to help us make sure apps on Google Play are safe for families.

All apps that comply with Google Play Families policies can opt in to be rated for the [Teacher Approved program](https://playacademy.exceedlms.com/sl/91535e27), but we cannot guarantee that your app will be included in the Teacher Approved program. 

#### [COLLAPSE ALL](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335) [EXPAND ALL](#1&2&3&4&5&6&7&87&9)

#### Play Console Requirements

**Target Audience and Content**

In the [Target Audience and Content](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9285070) section of the Google Play Console you must indicate the target audience for your app, prior to publishing, by selecting from the list of age groups provided. Regardless of what you identify in the Google Play Console, if you choose to include imagery and terminology in your app that could be considered targeting children, this may impact Google Play's assessment of your declared target audience. Google Play reserves the right to conduct its own review of the app information that you provide to determine whether the target audience that you disclose is accurate.

You should only select more than one age group for your app's target audience if you have designed your app for and ensured that your app is appropriate for users within the selected age group(s). For example, apps designed for babies, toddlers, and preschool children should only have the age group "Ages 5 & Under" selected as the age group target for those apps. If your app is designed for a specific level of school, choose the age group that best represents that school level. You should only select age groups that include both adults and children if you truly have designed your app for all ages.

**Updates to Target Audience and Content Section**

You can always update your app's information in the Target Audience and Content section in the Google Play Console. An [app update](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113476) is required before this information will be reflected on the Google Play store. However, any changes you make in this section of the Google Play Console may be reviewed for policy compliance even before an app update is submitted.

We strongly recommend that you let your existing users know if you change the target age group for your app or start using ads or in-app purchases, either by using the "What's New" section of your app's store listing page or through in-app notifications.

**Misrepresentation in Play Console**

Misrepresentation of any information about your app in the Play Console, including in the Target Audience and Content section, may result in removal or suspension of your app, so it is important to provide accurate information.

### Families Policy Requirements

If one of the target audiences for your app is children, you must comply with the following requirements. Failure to satisfy these requirements may result in app removal or suspension.

1.  **App content:** Your app's content that is accessible to children must be appropriate for children. If your app contains content that is not globally appropriate, but that content is deemed appropriate for child users in a particular region, the app may be available in that region ([limited regions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9899234)) but will remain unavailable in other regions.
2.  **App functionality:** Your app must not merely provide a webview of a website or have a primary purpose of driving affiliate traffic to a website without permission from the website owner or administrator.
3.  **Play Console answers:** You must accurately answer the questions in the Play Console regarding your app and update those answers to accurately reflect any changes to your app. This includes but is not limited to, providing accurate responses about your app in the Target Audience and Content section, Data safety section, and IARC Content Rating Questionnaire.
4.  **Data practices:** You must disclose the collection of any [personal and sensitive information](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888076#personal_sensitive) from children in your app, including through APIs and SDKs called or used in your app. Sensitive information from children includes, but is not limited to, authentication information, microphone and camera sensor data, device data, Android ID, and ad usage data. You must also ensure that your app follows the [data practices](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11043825) below:
    *   Apps that solely target children must not transmit Android advertising identifier (AAID), SIM Serial, Build Serial, BSSID, MAC, SSID, IMEI, and/or IMSI.
        *   Apps solely targeted to children should not request AD\_ID permission when targeting Android API 33 or higher.
    *   Apps that target both children and older audiences must not transmit AAID, SIM Serial, Build Serial, BSSID, MAC, SSID, IMEI, and/or IMSI from children or users of unknown age.
    *   Device phone number must not be requested from TelephonyManager of the Android API.
    *   Apps that solely target children may not request location permission, or collect, use, and transmit [precise location](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?hl=en#zippy=%2Cdata-types).
    *   Apps must use the [Companion Device Manager (CDM)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/companion/CompanionDeviceManager) when requesting Bluetooth, unless your app is only targeting device Operating System (OS) versions that are not compatible with CDM.
5.  **APIs and SDKs:** You must ensure that your app properly implements any APIs and SDKs.
    *   Apps that solely target children must not contain any APIs or SDKs that are not approved for use in primarily child-directed services.
        *   For example, an API Service using OAuth technology for authentication and authorization whose terms of service states that it is not approved for use in child-directed services.
    *   Apps that target both children and older audiences must not implement APIs or SDKs that are not approved for use in child-directed services unless they are used behind a [neutral age screen](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9285070#neutral-agescreen) or implemented in a way that does not result in the collection of data from children. Apps that target both children and older audiences must not require users to access app content through an API or SDK that is not approved for use in child-directed services.
6.  **Augmented Reality (AR)****:** If your app uses Augmented Reality, you must include a safety warning immediately upon launch of the AR section. The warning should contain the following:
    *   An appropriate message about the importance of parental supervision.
    *   A reminder to be aware of physical hazards in the real world (for example, be aware of your surroundings).
    *   Your app must not require the usage of a device that is advised not to be used by children (for example, Daydream, Oculus).
7.  **Social Apps & Features:** If your apps allows users to share or exchange information, you must accurately disclose these features in the [content rating questionnaire](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859655?visit_id=637679283344610643-1951945832&rd=1#questionnaire) on the Play Console.
    *   Social Apps: A social app is an app where the main focus is to enable users to share freeform content or communicate with large groups of people. All social apps that include children in their target audience must provide an in-app reminder to be safe online and to be aware of the real world risk of online interaction before allowing child users to exchange freeform media or information. You must also require adult action before allowing child users to exchange personal information.
    *   Social Features: A social feature is any additional app functionality that enables users to share freeform content or communicate with large groups of people. Any app that includes children in their target audience and has social features, must provide an in-app reminder to be safe online and to be aware of the real world risk of online interaction before allowing child users to exchange freeform media or information. You must also provide a method for adults to manage social features for child users, including, but not limited to, enabling/disabling the social feature or selecting different levels of functionality. Finally, you must require adult action before enabling features that allow children to exchange personal information.
    *   Adult action means a mechanism to verify that the user is not a child and does not encourage children to falsify their age to gain access to areas of your app that are designed for adults (that is, an adult PIN, password, birthdate, email verification, photo ID, credit card, or SSN).
    *   Social apps where the main focus of the app is to chat with people they do not know must not target children. Examples include: chat roulette style apps, dating apps, kids-focused open chat rooms, etc.
8.  **Legal compliance:** You must ensure that your app, including any APIs or SDKs that your app calls or uses, is compliant with the [U.S. Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA)](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children's-privacy), [E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679), and any other applicable laws or regulations.

Examples of common violations

*   Apps that promote play for children in their store-listing but the app content is only appropriate for adults.
*   Apps that implement APIs with terms of service that prohibit their use in child-directed apps.
*   Apps that glamorize the use of alcohol, tobacco or controlled substances.
*   Apps that include real or simulated gambling.
*   Apps that include violence, gore, or shocking content not appropriate for children.
*   Apps that provide dating services or offer sexual or marital advice.
*   Apps that contain links to websites that present content that violates Google Play’s [Developer Program policies](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/).
*   Apps that show mature ads (for example, violent content, sexual content, gambling content) to children. 

### Ads and Monetization

If you’re monetizing an app that targets children on Google Play, it’s important that your app follows the following Families Ads and Monetization Policy Requirements.

The policies below apply to all monetization and advertising in your app, including ads, cross-promotions (for your apps and third party apps), offers for in-app purchases, or any other commercial content (such as paid product placement). All monetization and advertising in these apps must comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including any relevant self-regulatory or industry guidelines).

Google Play reserves the right to reject, remove or suspend apps for overly aggressive commercial tactics.

**Ads requirements**

 If your app displays ads to children or to users of unknown age, you must:

*   Only use [Google Play Families Self-Certified Ads SDKs](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9900633) to display ads to those users;
*   Ensure ads displayed to those users do not involve interest-based advertising (advertising targeted at individual users who have certain characteristics based on their online browsing behavior) or remarketing (advertising targeted at individual users based on previous interaction with an app or website); 
*   Ensure ads displayed to those users present content that is appropriate for children;
*   Ensure ads displayed to those users follow the Families ad format requirements; and
*   Ensure compliance with all applicable legal regulations and industry standards relating to advertising to children.

**Ads format requirements**

Monetization and advertising in your app must not have deceptive content or be designed in a way that will result in inadvertent clicks from child users.

If the sole target audience for your app is children, the following are prohibited. If the target audiences of your app is children and older audiences, the following are prohibited when serving ads to children or users of unknown age:

*   Disruptive monetization and advertising, including monetization and advertising that take up the entire screen or interfere with normal use and do not provide a clear means to dismiss the ad (for example, [Ad walls](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753#disruptive-ads)).
*   Monetization and advertising that interfere with normal app use or game play, including rewarded or opt-in ads, that are not closeable after 5 seconds.
*   Monetization and advertising that do not interfere with normal app use or game play may persist for more than 5 seconds (for example, video content with integrated ads).
*   Interstitial monetization and advertising displayed immediately upon app launch.
*   Multiple ad placements on a page (for example, banner ads that show multiple offers in one placement or displaying more than one banner or video ad is not allowed).
*   Monetization and advertising that are not clearly distinguishable from your app content, such as offerwalls and other immersive ads experiences.
*   Use of shocking or emotionally manipulative tactics to encourage ads viewing or in-app purchases.
*   Deceptive ads that force the user to click-through by using a dismiss button to trigger another ad, or by making ads suddenly appear in areas of the app where the user usually taps for another function.
*   Not providing a distinction between the use of virtual game coins versus real-life money to make in-app purchases.

Examples of common violations

*   Monetization and advertising that move away from a user's finger as the user tries to close it
*   Monetization and advertising that do not provide a user with a way to a exit the offer after five (5) seconds as depicted in the example below:  
    ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/Yney83HbD6X1WyFsKQfZSu3R3dZRYRRe24aq)  
     
*   Monetization and advertising that take up the majority or the device screen without providing the user a clear way to dismiss it, as depicted in the example below:
    
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/x_00itIxYS9KEaMpKssADj_fX0dSUff6o6Nt04ASG4pey542vycDMIyFXX5clJE_fDSb=w895-h503)
    

*   Banner ads showing multiple offers, as depicted in the example below: ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/FsWSkB1jUDZN6U3q53gxfYNee-Y5D1QeoVH3bdJ-2uuvIf9iZLM0mDV3fMZSdd18yxM=w895-h503)

*   Monetization and advertising that could be mistaken by a user for app content, as depicted in the example below:  
    ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/JZk0x1JU5sP9YnXXMF4LJ8HDOfFJXJr1ssLSRxAD1UjHhvuGRmDBE2VhR3wzwgAJpgE=w895-h503)

*   Buttons, ads, or other monetization that promote your other Google Play store listings but that are indistinguishable from app content, as depicted in the example below: ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/RcNH80fh9w-1FFSzywqZ_GiXKlSPxzcua03TA_TdfQUqX42klFu0SmCw47j0Fd7onMex=w895-h503)

**Here are some examples of inappropriate ad content that should not be displayed to children.**

*   **Inappropriate Media Content**: Ads for TV shows, movies, music albums, or any other media outlet that are not appropriate for children.
*   **Inappropriate Video Games & Downloadable Software**: Ads for downloadable software and electronic video games that are not appropriate for children.
*   **Controlled or Harmful Substances**: Ads for alcohol, tobacco, controlled substances, or any other harmful substances.
*   **Gambling**: Ads for simulated gambling, contests or sweepstakes promotions, even if free to enter.
*   **Adult and Sexually Suggestive Content**: Ads with sexual, sexually suggestive and mature content.
*   **Dating or Relationships**: Ads for dating or adult relationship sites.
*   **Violent Content**: Ads with violent and graphic content that is not appropriate for children.

**Ads SDKs**

If you serve ads in your app and your target audience only includes children, then you must use only [Families self-certified ads SDK](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9900633/) versions. If the target audience for your app includes both children and older users, you must implement age screening measures, such as a [neutral age screen](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9285070#neutral-agescreen), and make sure that ads shown to children come exclusively from Google Play self-certified ads SDK versions. 

Please refer to the [Families Self-Certified Ads SDK Program policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9900633/) page for more details on these requirements and refer [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9283445) to see the current list of Families Self-Certified ads SDK versions.

If you use AdMob, refer to the [AdMob Help Center](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6223431) for more details on their products.

It is your responsibility to ensure your app satisfies all requirements concerning advertisements, in-app purchases, and commercial content. Contact your ads SDK provider(s) to learn more about their content policies and advertising practices.

Policy Coverage
===============

Our policies apply to any content your app displays or links to, including any ads it shows to users and any user-generated content it hosts or links to. Further, they apply to any content from your developer account which is publicly displayed in Google Play, including your developer name and the landing page of your listed developer website.

We don't allow apps that let users install other apps to their devices. Apps that provide access to other apps, games, or software without installation, including features and experiences provided by third parties, must ensure that all the content they provide access to adheres to all [Google Play policies](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11044265) and may also be subject to additional policy reviews.

Defined terms used in these policies have the same meaning as in the [Developer Distribution Agreement](https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html) (DDA). In addition to complying with these policies and the DDA, the content of your app must be rated in accordance with our [Content Rating Guidelines](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/188189).

We don’t allow apps or app content that undermine user trust in the Google Play ecosystem. In assessing whether to include or remove apps from Google Play, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, a pattern of harmful behavior or high risk of abuse. We identify risk of abuse including, but not limited to, items such as app- and developer-specific complaints, news reporting, previous violation history, user feedback, and use of popular brands, characters, and other assets.

#### How Google Play Protect works

Google Play Protect checks apps when you install them. It also periodically scans your device. If it finds a potentially harmful app, it might:

*   Send you a notification. To remove the app, tap the notification, then tap Uninstall.
*   Disable the app until you uninstall it.
*   Remove the app automatically. In most cases, if a harmful app has been detected, you will get a notification saying that the app was removed.

#### How malware protection works

To protect you against malicious third-party software, URLs and other security issues, Google may receive information about:

*   Your device's network connections 
*   Potentially harmful URLs 
*   Operating system, and apps installed on your device through Google Play or other sources.

You may get a warning from Google about an app or URL that may be unsafe. The app or URL may be removed or blocked from installation by Google if it is known to be harmful to devices, data or users.

You can choose to disable some of these protections in your device settings. But Google may continue to receive information about apps installed through Google Play, and apps installed on your device from other sources may continue to be checked for security issues without sending information to Google.

#### How Privacy alerts work

Google Play Protect will alert you if an app is removed from the Google Play Store because the app may access your personal information and you’ll have an option to uninstall the app.

Enforcement Process
===================

When reviewing content or accounts to determine whether they are illegal or violate our policies, we take various information into consideration when making a decision, including app metadata (for example, app title, description), in-app experience, account information (for example, past history of policy violations), any third-party code in apps, and other information provided through reporting mechanisms (where applicable) and own-initiative reviews. Note that you are responsible for ensuring that any third-party code (for example, an SDK) used in your app, and such third party’s practices with respect to your app, are compliant with all Google Play Developer Program policies.

If your app or developer account violates any of our policies, we’ll take appropriate action as outlined below. In addition, we’ll provide you with relevant information about the action we’ve taken via email along with instructions on how to appeal if you believe we’ve taken action in error.

Please note that removal or administrative notices may not indicate each and every policy violation present in your account, app, or broader app catalog. Developers are responsible for addressing any policy issue and conducting extra due diligence to ensure that the remainder of their app or account is fully policy compliant. Failure to address policy violations in your account and all of your apps may result in additional enforcement actions.

Repeated or serious violations (such as malware, fraud, and apps that may cause user or device harm) of these policies or the [Developer Distribution Agreement](https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html) (DDA) will result in termination of individual or related Google Play Developer accounts.

#### Enforcement Actions 

Different enforcement actions can impact your apps in different ways. We use a combination of human and automated evaluation to review apps and app content to detect and assess content which violates our policies and is harmful to users and the overall Google Play ecosystem. Using automated models helps us detect more violations and evaluate potential issues faster, which helps keep Google Play safe for everyone. The policy-violating content is either removed by our automated models or, where a more nuanced determination is required, it is flagged for further review by trained operators and analysts who conduct content evaluations, for example because an understanding of the context of the piece of content is required. The results of these manual reviews are then used to help build training data to further improve our machine learning models.

The following section describes the various actions Google Play may take, and the impact to your app and/or your Google Play Developer account.

Unless otherwise noted in an enforcement communication, these actions affect all regions. For example, if your app is suspended, it will be unavailable in all regions. In addition, unless otherwise noted, these actions will remain in effect unless you appeal the action and the appeal is granted.

#### Rejection

*   A new app or app update submitted for review will not be made available on Google Play. 
*   If an update to an existing app was rejected, the app version published prior to the update will remain available on Google Play.
*   Rejections don’t impact your access to a rejected app’s existing user installs, statistics, and ratings. 
*   Rejections don’t impact the standing of your Google Play Developer account.

Note: Do not attempt to resubmit a rejected app until you’ve fixed all the policy violations.

#### Removal

*   The app, along with any previous versions of that app, are removed from Google Play and will no longer be available for users to download.
*   Because the app is removed, users will not be able to see the app’s store listing. This information will be restored once you submit a policy-compliant update for the removed app.
*   Users may not be able to make any in-app purchases, or utilize any in-app billing features in the app until a policy-compliant version is approved by Google Play.
*   Removals don’t immediately impact the standing of your Google Play Developer account, but multiple removals may result in a suspension.

Note: Don't attempt to republish a removed app until you’ve fixed all policy violations.

#### Suspension

*   The app, along with any previous versions of that app, are removed from Google Play and will no longer be available for users to download.
*   Suspension can occur as the result of egregious or multiple policy violations, as well as repeated app rejections or removals.
*   Because the app is suspended, users will not be able to see the app’s store listing. 
*   You can no longer use a suspended app’s APK or app bundle.
*   Users will not be able to make any in-app purchases, or utilize any in-app billing features in the app.
*   Suspensions count as strikes against the good standing of your Google Play Developer account. Multiple strikes can result in the termination of individual and related Google Play Developer accounts.

#### Limited Visibility

*   Your app’s discoverability on Google Play is restricted. Your app will remain available on Google Play and can be accessed by users with a direct link to the app’s store listing. 
*   Having your app placed in a Limited Visibility state doesn’t impact the standing of your Google Play Developer account. 
*   Having your app placed in a Limited Visibility state doesn’t impact users’ ability to see the app’s existing store listing.

#### Limited Regions

*   Your app can only be downloaded by users through Google Play in certain regions.
*   Users from other regions will not be able to find the app on the Play Store.
*   Users who previously installed the app can continue to use it on their device but will no longer receive updates.
*   Region limiting does not impact the standing of your Google Play Developer account.

#### Restricted Developer Account

*   When your developer account is in a restricted state, all apps in your catalog will be removed from Google Play and you will no longer be able to publish new apps or republish existing apps. You will still be able to access the Play Console.
*   Because all apps are removed, users will not be able to see your app’s store listing and your developer profile.
*   Your current users will not be able to make any in-app purchases or utilize any in-app billing features of your apps.
*   You can still use the Play Console to provide more information to Google Play and amend your account information.
*   You will be able to republish your apps once you have fixed all policy violations.

#### Account Termination

*   When your developer account is terminated, all apps in your catalog will be removed from Google Play and you will no longer be able to publish new apps. This also means that any related Google Play developer accounts will also be permanently suspended.
*   Multiple suspensions or suspensions for egregious policy violations may also result in the termination of your Play Console account.
*   Because the apps within the terminated account are removed, users will not be able to see your apps’ store listing and your developer profile.
*   Your current users will not be able to make any in-app purchases, or utilize any in-app billing features of your apps.

Note: Any new account that you try to open will be terminated as well (without a refund of the developer registration fee), so please do not attempt to register for a new Play Console account while one of your other accounts are terminated.

#### Dormant Accounts

Dormant accounts are developer accounts that are inactive or abandoned. Dormant accounts are not in good standing as required by the [Developer Distribution Agreement](https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html).

Google Play Developer Accounts are intended for active developers who publish and actively maintain apps. To prevent abuse, we close accounts that are dormant or not used or otherwise significantly engaged (for example, for publishing and updating apps, accessing statistics, or managing store listings) on a regular basis.

[Dormant account closure](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11605267) will result in your account being closed. Any reports, statistics, insights, or other information within Play Console will no longer be available to you unless your dormant account is reinstated. Your registration fee is not refundable and will be forfeited. Before we close your dormant account, we will notify you using the contact information that you provided for that account.

Closure of a dormant account will not limit your ability to create a new account in the future if you decide to publish on Google Play.

App Discovery and Ranking
=========================

Our goal is to help users easily discover apps and games they will enjoy from the millions on Google Play. 

Users can learn about and install apps in many different ways on Google Play, on many different types of devices, including phones, tablets and TVs. For example, users can browse the homepage or sub navigation pages, search for an app, find details on app detail pages, or read through editorial selections. 

We want users to see content that is relevant to them and have a positive experience with the apps they download. We generally favor apps that are high quality and relevant to a broad audience. The best thing a developer can do to increase discoverability is to build an app that people enjoy and recommend to others.

We constantly test and optimize the discovery experience on Google Play, from adding new discovery pages, to experimenting with different visual formats and layouts, and enhancing our ranking algorithms.

### **Understanding apps**

Google Play needs to understand the content and functionality of an app in order to help users discover the right app at the right time. 

When a developer submits an app to Google Play, the developer provides information about the app and its characteristics (for example app title, description, category and graphic assets) and information about the app’s content and functionality.  In addition, Google identifies additional characteristics from the app (for example, that the app is a “multiplayer” game) and analyzes user feedback (for example, through ratings, reviews and engagement). This information informs Google’s approach to ranking and helps Google organize apps and present them to users whether they are browsing for something new or searching for a specific title.

### **Organizing and ranking apps**

Users have many options for how to discover apps on Google Play. Our goal in organizing apps in Play is to determine which apps to display, how many to display, and how to display those apps in a user-friendly way.  Many factors are involved when organizing apps, including:

*   **User relevance**: The most relevant apps to a user depends on where they are browsing or the query they use in a search. 
*   **Quality of the app experience**: Apps that have strong technical performance and a good user experience are generally favored over lower quality apps.
*   **Editorial value**: Google Play provides curated recommendations to help users find content that is noteworthy and interesting.  
*   **Ads**: Some developers choose to advertise on Google Play similar to other Google properties. These ads are well marked and shown alongside other content. 
*   **User experience:** Google Play endeavors to ensure users have a positive experience in navigating the wide range of available apps.

These main factors impacting ranking are weighted differently based on where on Google Play a user is looking, the device they are on, and their personal preferences. For example, apps shown on Top Charts are heavily influenced by popularity, whereas apps shown in search results are heavily influenced by relevance to the user’s query. Additionally, some apps are optimized for different devices and could be ranked higher when searched on a TV than on mobile for example, or may only be available on certain devices (for example, a car). 

Detailed information on the main factors influencing ranking:

#### **A. User relevance**

We want to show people content that is relevant to them.  The starting point is to determine which Google Play surface the user is on, and ensure apps are relevant and available.  For example, some apps are only available in certain countries or compatible with certain devices (including specific form factors), such as Android TV.

To return relevant content to users, we also need to establish what they are looking for.  We may determine user intent by implicit or explicit signals.  For example, if a user visits a specific destination, such as the “Kids” tab (learn more about [our Teacher Approved program](https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/teacher-approved-apps)), they are expressing an interest in seeing only apps for kids, and by visiting the “Editors’ Choice” tab, they are expressing an interest in seeing only apps recommended by Google Play’s editors.  

When the user is using the search functionality, we need to establish the intent behind their query. We do this by deciphering the words typed and trying to determine if the user is looking for a specific app (by typing what we detect as the name of the app) or a category of apps (for example, racing games). This may include identifying other words, such as synonyms, to consider the appropriate set of results.  Once we establish intent, metadata (for example, title, description, category) and other signals are used to determine which apps best address the user’s query. When an intent is narrow (such as an exact title search), we try to return that title. However, as an intent becomes broader (for example, a search for “photo editing”), many apps may be relevant. Google Play may factor in other signals which we believe will help users find apps that they will have better experiences with, such as the other factors described below (for example, app quality) or how users respond to results for a given query.  We may also include Play Movies and Books content if we believe users are looking for such content while using the search feature.

We need to cater to billions of users, from over 190 countries, and across age groups. For that reason, across Google Play, we also consider whether an app can be relevant to and appropriate for a broad audience. If the app is more narrow in its relevance or audience, we may only give prominence to the app if we can determine with high confidence (e.g. through  the search query or browsing state) that the user is specifically looking for these kinds of apps that are more narrow in relevance or audience.  We may also show personalized recommendations to users. For example, we may use information we have collected (such as the apps a user previously installed) to generate recommendations for apps in a “For You” cluster. The [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) provides more information on how Google personalizes its services and users’ privacy controls.

**Manage your personalization settings**

To turn off personalization using order history and Google activity:

1.  Sign in to your Google Account.
2.  Go to [Activity controls](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols).
3.  Turn off Web & App Activity.

To find and delete past activity, and remove from personalization:

1.  Sign in to your Google Account.
2.  Go to [Activity controls](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols).
3.  Go to Manage activity.

For more detailed information, read [Delete your activity](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/465#delete-manually).

Tip: If you delete past activity, it may impact your experience in other Google services like Google Search and Google Assistant. You can always turn your Web & App Activity setting back on, delete it, or change your settings at [account.google.com](http://account.google.com/).

[Learn more about Web & App Activity](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/54068).

#### **B. Quality of the app experience**

Android users expect high-quality apps, i.e. apps that deliver an overall good user experience and provide value to users beyond basic device capabilities.  We also value high-quality apps as we believe that when users have positive experiences with apps they install, they are more likely to trust in the quality of apps on Google Play, which benefits the entire ecosystem.

We combine both manual signals and algorithmic methods to ensure that the apps we recommend to users are high quality.  “App quality” is not only a function of the experience within the app itself but also key elements of the pre-install experience, such as the app’s icon, title, screenshots, videos, description and links. These should aid the user decision-making experience and provide a good representation of the app and its characteristics. The customer support experience the developer provides can also be relevant.  Other factors that may help indicate that an app is high-quality include whether the app: 

*   provides standard visual design and user interaction patterns for a consistent and intuitive user experience; 
*   If ad-supported, has a good ads experience inside the app;
*   provides the expected functional behavior, content, and features; and
*   provides the compatibility, performance, stability, and responsiveness expected by users. 

Determining whether an app is high- or low-quality is important in helping to ensure that apps that provide low value to users or that don’t perform as users’ expect do not appear on surfaces where users seek to discover new app recommendations or rise to the top in search results. Since app quality will help determine how apps are organized on Google Play, we work hard to provide developers with guidance and tools to help them improve their app quality. We provide testing [guidelines](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/core-app-quality) to developers to help them assess the core aspects of quality in their app; additional guidelines to make sure developers provide an excellent user experience and gain additional exposure available for Wear OS, TV, and Auto apps; and a [checklist](https://developers.google.com/games/services/checklist) for developers using Google Play Games Services.  We enable developers to iterate on ideas and improve the quality of their apps before launch by gathering feedback from testers in [internal, closed and open tracks](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/test-tracks). We also provide developers with [tips on improving app quality](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/store-listing) and [resources in the Academy for App Success](https://playacademy.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=1788-learn-about-improving-app-quality). Within the Google Play Console, developers can utilize tools such as [app statistics](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/139628), [Android vitals](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7385505) for technical performance analysis, [ratings and reviews analysis](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/engage/user-reviews). The Play Console allows developers to compare their app’s performance to peer sets to help better understand where they can improve their own app’s performance. Developers also have access to user feedback in the form of public ratings and reviews, which are helpful in identifying quality or support concerns from users.

#### **C. Editorial value**

Users also rely on Google Play’s perspective on what content is noteworthy and interesting, and we provide curated recommendations from the Google Play team to help them find it.  

This includes manual selection of content for featuring & promotion and creation of custom manual placements by a team of Google Play editors and merchandisers. These placements can be ongoing (for example, articles, labels or descriptions) or limited duration (for example, seasonal moments), and may be presented using a variety of visual layouts.

When selecting content, the editorial and merchandising teams focus on the quality of the app experience (see above), as well as criteria such as the novelty, design, usefulness of the content, and breadth of appeal.  We use the “Editors’ Choice” label to highlight what we deem the very best apps for a given topic. We may also provide additional written descriptions on what we think makes the content interesting (e.g. “why we love this” bullets).

We may also do merchandising campaigns.  The team may consider timeliness and local relevance when creating a campaign, and such campaigns can include promotions (e.g. Black Friday sale), local events (e.g. Halloween), or content moments (e.g. a new release or a major update).  For some campaigns, the team may also consider monetization potential when selecting content.

#### **D. Ads**

Developers can pay to be displayed in clearly marked sections of Google Play through advertising. Ads are always marked with a label like 'ads' or 'sponsored'. Learn more about how to [create a Google Ads campaign for your app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6262700).

#### E. User experience on Google Play

We want to ensure users have a positive experience when navigating Google Play and can discover the apps they want, as well as new and undiscovered titles, and useful information about those apps.  We therefore consider the user experience when designing all aspects of Google Play, for example, how we group apps, where and how many ads to show in results, and the formats we use to present apps to users. The more helpful and engaging the user experience is on Google Play, the more often users will return to discover and install new apps.

Availability of Features and Services
=====================================

Google Play strives to treat developers fairly and equitably whether [](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/cluster?clp=igM4ChkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDEhkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDGAA%3D:S:ANO1ljLC8CY&gsr=CjuKAzgKGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMSGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMYAA%3D%3D:S:ANO1ljKF24s&hl=en_US)big or small, third party apps or [first party Google apps.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/cluster?clp=igM4ChkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDEhkKEzU3MDAzMTM2MTg3ODYxNzc3MDUQCBgDGAA%3D:S:ANO1ljLC8CY&gsr=CjuKAzgKGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMSGQoTNTcwMDMxMzYxODc4NjE3NzcwNRAIGAMYAA%3D%3D:S:ANO1ljKF24s&hl=en_US) For example, all apps are subject to the same set of rules and policies and all apps are promoted in the Play store according to the same principles.

Google Play has millions of developers with different needs and goals. In order to meet those needs, sometimes Google Play will make available features and functionality to some but not all developers.

For example, just like how Google Play offers developers the ability to [beta test their apps](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7003180) with a subset of users, in some cases, we add new features or capabilities to Google Play that are available to a subset of developers, third party and first party.  For example, we may run an early access program to test and get feedback on special app release features or custom store listing targeting features.

Further, our ability to share some data outside of Google or make features widely available to all developers may be limited due to legal, privacy, security concerns, to protect Google’s confidential, proprietary information, or other business considerations. 

For example, in limited cases, some Google apps may have access to information not shared with all developers. 

*   Some Google apps may have direct access to their own apps’ aggregate data (such as installs, uninstalls, store listing visits) to undertake custom analysis. We endeavour to make as much of this data available to developers via the Google Play Console, in downloadable formats, or via APIs, but it may not be in the same format, or to the same granularity.
*   Some Google apps may have direct access to their own user-identifiable app data, or from other Google apps, in accordance with the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). For instance, this data may be used to provide subscription services across multiple devices for a single user, or to provide a seamless experience for users across multiple Google apps.  
*   Some Google apps may also have access to aggregate data about the Google Play ecosystem that cannot be shared with all developers due to the fact that such data is Google’s confidential, proprietary business information and is thus commercially sensitive. For example, Google apps may have access to total spend in a specific market or total installs for a given category of apps. We are constantly working to extend the number of ecosystem insights available to third parties in the Google Play Console and through programs run by our business development teams.
*   Lastly, some Google apps may have access to Google Play features that differ from what is available to other developers due to a variety of business considerations and security concerns. For example, in a few limited instances, some features of Google Play’s billing system are only available to a small number of Google apps. Movies and TV content as well as books sold on Google Play and in the Google Play Movies & TV and Google Play Books apps, for instance, can be pre-ordered, but such capability is not available to all developers due to scalability challenges. Google Stadia subscriptions can be billed to a family form of payment in the Google Stadia app, but since the definition of a family/group may differ from app to app, this capability has not been extended to other developers. Further, Google streamlines the distribution and updates of Google Play Services for AR and certain payments libraries when users install apps whose features may depend on this software.  User trust concerns limit our ability to make such capability widely available. Finally, Google Play allows some Google apps to access new unreleased Google software or test their apps with Google employees in ways that are not available for third party apps because of security concerns or commercial sensitivities.  

In all instances, Google listens and works hard to ensure that all developers have the tools and capabilities they need to successfully grow their businesses.
