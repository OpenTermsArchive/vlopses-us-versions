Our Policies


================

YouTube’s mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world — and openness and free expression are at the heart of this. Our platform is a place where a broad range of perspectives are encouraged, and we don’t shy away from disagreement and debate.

How Community & Ad-Friendly Guidelines work
-------------------------------------------

Our policies help us maintain a responsible business that viewers, creators, and advertisers can rely on in order to continue to thrive on YouTube.

As with any system, we sometimes make mistakes. That’s why [appeals](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/185111?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&sjid=9395522532112275037-NC) are an important part of our processes. Creators are notified when their videos are removed due to policy violations or when they may be suspended from YPP, and can appeal if they disagree with our decision.

Our [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) and [Advertiser-Friendly Content Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278) are what enable us to strike this balance.

[Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567)

Content that violates our community guidelines is flagged by a mix of **automated detection and human reporting** — most is automatically detected — and we go to great lengths to make sure violative content isn’t widely viewed, or even viewed at all, before it’s taken down.

Exceptions can be made when content has a clear educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic [(EDSA)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162?ref_topic=9282435&sjid=277005303270439027-NA) context.

[Advertiser-Friendly Content Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278)

Brands rely on us to protect their business interests when they’re advertising on YouTube.

To help support this, we have a set of Ad-Friendly guidelines creators in the [YouTube Partner Program (YPP)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en) need to follow in order to have Ads served on their channel content and earn a share of the revenue.

How we support creators
-----------------------

Since 2007, we’ve been paying eligible creators every month through our revenue-sharing model, the [YouTube Partner Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851).

For a creator to be eligible for YPP, they must meet a higher bar for what they share on YouTube. Creators have to follow [YouTube monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392) and we review each applicant’s channel before admitting them to YPP. We also demonetize videos that violate our Advertiser Friendly Guidelines, and suspend creators from YPP for repeat offenses. With this model, creators have a long-term incentive to reinforce YouTube’s safety and follow our policies.

We also provide Creators with an array of tools to manage their content & communities:

Manage Experiences

Channel Guidelines help creators set what kind of conversations they want to have on their channel.

Creators can hold potentially inappropriate comments for review, hide certain individuals, block words, assign moderation privileges, and more.

How YouTube Partners with Industry Experts to Combat Abuse
----------------------------------------------------------

Content that’s meant to praise, promote, or aid violent extremist or criminal organizations is not allowed on YouTube. We rely on many factors — like certain government and international organization designations — to determine what constitutes criminal or terrorist organizations.

We’re also a founding member of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism [(GIFCT)](https://gifct.org/), where we work with other tech companies to keep terrorist content off the web — and provide training and other resources to smaller companies facing similar challenges.

This content covers how to appeal Community Guidelines strikes and removals. If your video was removed for copyright reasons, learn about your options for [copyright strikes](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000).

When we remove your content for a Community Guidelines violation, you may be issued a strike. Strikes are issued when content on YouTube is flagged for review, either by members of the YouTube community or our smart detection technology, and our review teams decide that it does not follow our Community Guidelines. If your channel gets a strike, you'll get an email, notifications on mobile and desktop, and an alert in your channel settings the next time you sign in to YouTube.

Before you start, review the [policy related to the strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/2803176). We also list examples of content that result in a Community Guidelines strike. For warnings and strikes, you can appeal for 6 months after the warning or strike was issued. For content removals, you have up to 1 year after your content was removed to submit an appeal. This 1 year window applies to all types of content removals including videos, posts, playlists, thumbnails and URLs.

If you've received a Community Guidelines strike for links in your content, make sure you're familiar with our [policy and appeals process for links in your content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257).

Appeal a Community Guidelines strike
------------------------------------

When we remove your content for a Community Guidelines violation, you may be issued a strike. Strikes are issued when content on YouTube is flagged for review, either by members of the YouTube community or our smart detection technology, and our review teams decide that it does not follow our Community Guidelines. If your channel gets a strike, you'll get an email, notifications on mobile and desktop, and an alert in your channel settings the next time you sign in to YouTube.

Before you start, review the [policy related to the strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/2803176). We also list examples of content that result in a Community Guidelines strike. You can appeal for 6 months after the warning or strike was issued. 

#### Appeal a strike 

1. Go to your Dashboard in YouTube Studio.
2. Select the Channel violations card.
3. Select **APPEAL.**

**Note**: Deleting the video will not resolve the strike. If you delete your video, the strike will remain on your channel and you won't be able to appeal again.

If you've received a Community Guidelines strike for links in your content, make sure you're familiar with our [policy and appeals process for links in your content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257).

**If it’s a playlist or thumbnail:**  
You’ll receive an email if your playlist or thumbnail was removed for violating our Community Guidelines. If you think that your content doesn't violate the Community Guidelines and was removed in error, use the form provided in the email to appeal.

**Note**: Videos can be taken down for many reasons. If you're having trouble appealing a video removal, it may have been removed for reasons other than a Community Guidelines violation. You can troubleshoot video takedowns in this [Help Center article](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024). 

### After you submit an appeal

You'll get an email from YouTube letting you know the result of your appeal request. One of the following will happen:

* If we find that your content followed our Community Guidelines, we'll reinstate it and remove the strike from your channel. If you appeal a warning and the appeal is granted, the next offense will be a warning.
* If we find your content followed our Community Guidelines, but isn’t appropriate for all audiences, we’ll apply an age-restriction. If it’s a video, it won’t be visible to users who are signed out, are under 18 years of age, or have [Restricted Mode](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/174084?hl=en) turned on. If it’s a custom thumbnail, it will be removed.
* If we find that your content was in violation of our Community Guidelines, the strike will stay and the video will remain down from the site. There's no additional penalty for appeals that are rejected.

You may appeal each strike only once.

When you use YouTube, you join a community of people from all over the world. The guidelines below help keep YouTube fun and enjoyable for everyone.

If you see content that you think violates these guidelines, [report it](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may stay on YouTube when it has [Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162). In these cases, the content gets an EDSA exception.

These policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including, for example, unlisted and private content, comments, [links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257), posts, and thumbnails. This list isn’t complete.

_**Please take these rules seriously**. If a YouTube creator’s on- and/or off-platform behavior harms our users, community, employees or ecosystem, we may respond based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the egregiousness of their actions and whether a pattern of harmful behavior exists. Our response will range from suspending a creator’s privileges to account termination._

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

Violent or gory content intended to shock or disgust viewers, or content encouraging others to commit violent acts, are not allowed on YouTube.

If you believe anyone is in imminent danger, you should get in touch with your local law enforcement agency to report the situation immediately.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

**Violent or graphic content**:

* Inciting others to commit violent acts against individuals or a defined group of people.
* Fights involving minors.
* Footage, audio, or imagery involving road accidents, terrorist attack aftermath, street fights, physical attacks, immolation, torture, corpses, robberies, or other such scenarios with the intent to shock or disgust viewers.
* Footage or imagery showing bodily fluids, such as blood or vomit, with the intent to shock or disgust viewers.
* Footage of corpses with massive injuries, such as severed limbs.

**Animal abuse content**:

* Content where humans coerce animals to fight.
* Content where a human maliciously mistreats an animal and causes them to experience distress outside of traditional or standard practices. Examples of traditional or standard practices include hunting or food preparation.
* Content where a human unnecessarily puts an animal in poor conditions outside of traditional or standard practices. Examples of traditional or standard practices include hunting or food preparation.
* Content that glorifies or promotes serious neglect, mistreatment, or harm toward animals.
* Content that shows animal rescue that is staged and puts the animal in harmful scenarios.
* Graphic content that features animals and intends to shock or disgust.

**Dramatized or fictional content**:

* Dramatized or fictional footage of content prohibited by these guidelines where the viewer is not given enough context to understand that the footage is dramatized or fictional.

Note that we may not allow the following kinds of content even if there's educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context provided:

* Violent physical sexual assaults (video, still imagery, or audio).
* Footage filmed by the perpetrator during a deadly or major violent event, in which weapons, violence, or injured victims are visible or audible.

Please note that this is not a complete list.

Keep in mind that this policy also applies to videos, video descriptions, thumbnails, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

Educational content

We may allow the kinds of violent or graphic content noted above in some cases in educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content. This is not a pass to upload content meant to shock or disgust, or encourage others to commit violent acts, and we may not make these exceptions for certain kinds of content, like footage of violent physical sexual assault. For educational content containing the kinds of violent or graphic content noted above, this context must appear in the images or audio of the video itself. Providing it in the title or description is insufficient.

For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party industry ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.

Age-restricted content and EDSA exceptions

We may apply an age-restriction rather than remove violent or graphic content if that content provides enough context to understand it. For example, content showing victims’ injuries in a road accident may be removed, but we may age-restrict that same content if presented with news coverage that explains the situation and context. For educational use of violent or graphic content, this context must appear in the images or audio of the video itself. You can learn more about the [importance of context here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162).

We also consider public interest when deciding whether content should be allowed, age-restricted, or removed. For example, we may allow or age-restrict graphic or violent content documenting warzones, civil unrest, humanitarian crises, or natural disasters with adequate educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context in the images or audio of the video, the video title, or the video description.

We may age-restrict dramatized violence when it contains graphic scenes, such as people being tortured, dismembered, or decapitated. We may also age-restrict content that focuses on human corpses with these severe injuries or violent deaths of a person that show blood. We make a distinction between dramatized violence featuring real human actors and content featuring animations or video games. Dramatized violence featuring real human actors may be more likely to face age-restrictions, especially if the content is particularly graphic or realistic. Generally, we do not remove dramatized violence when the content or metadata lets us know that the content is fictional, or when it’s apparent from the content itself, such as with animated content or video games.

We consider the following when deciding whether to allow, age-restrict or remove content. Note that this isn’t a complete list:

* Whether violent or gory imagery is the focus of the video. For example, the video focuses solely on the most graphically violent part of a film or video game.
* Whether the title, description, tags, or other data show an intent to shock or disgust viewers.
* Whether violent imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured.
* The amount of time the violent images or audio is in the content.
* Whether there’s context that lets viewers know that the imagery is dramatized or fictional. For example, through info in the video, title, or description.
* Whether the violence is part of a religious or cultural practice, and the uploader gives viewers that context.
* Whether the content shows the killing of an animal via traditional or standard practices for hunting, religious practice, or food preparation.
* Whether the dramatized violence is depicted with real human actors or animation including video games.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

* Encouraging others to go to a particular place to commit violence, to perform violence at a particular time, or to target individuals or groups with violence.
* Actual schoolyard fights between minors. We may allow content if minors are only play fighting and that is evident to viewers.
* Beatings or brawls outside the context of professional or professionally supervised sporting events.

More examples
-------------

Violent or graphic content

The following types of content are not allowed on YouTube. This is not a complete list.

* Content that shows medical procedure footage with the intent to shock or disgust viewers.
* Footage of crimes such as violent robberies that provide no education or explanation to viewers.
* Cell phone, dash cam, or closed circuit TV footage showing the injured or killed in a road accident accompanied by titles such as “Crazy accident” or “Warning: Lots of blood.”
* Videos of beheadings.
* One-sided assaults with titles like "Watch this guy get beat-up!".

Animal abuse content

Animal abuse refers to content that shows the malicious infliction of serious physical or psychological harm that causes an animal to suffer. We may make exceptions for content that shows widely accepted practices, like hunting, trapping, pest abatement, food preparation, medical treatment, or animal slaughter that shows harm to an animal or group of animals.

Here are more examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube:

* Dog fighting, cockfighting, or other coerced animal fighting where humans force animals to attack each other. We do allow content that shows animals fighting in the wild, like in a nature documentary.
* Content that shows animal suffering, neglect, or mistreatment to shock the viewer or glorify the abuse, and doesn’t give enough educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context.
* Bullfighting with bulls being harmed, like swords in the bull.
* Hunting using non-standard practices, like bombs or poison.
* The staged rescue of animals where the animals are intentionally harmed or placed in dangerous scenarios for dramatic effect.

The above list isn’t complete.

Remember these examples are just some examples, and don’t post content if you think it might violate this policy.

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

  

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

Content intended to praise, promote, or aid violent extremist or criminal organizations is not allowed on YouTube. These organizations are not allowed to use YouTube for any purpose, including recruitment.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

If you believe anyone is in immediate danger, you should reach out to your local law enforcement agency to report the situation immediately.

What this means for you
-----------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

* Content produced by violent extremist, criminal, or terrorist organizations
* Content praising or memorializing prominent terrorist, extremist, or criminal figures in order to encourage others to carry out acts of violence
* Content praising or justifying violent acts carried out by violent extremist, criminal, or terrorist organizations
* Content aimed at recruiting new members to violent extremist, criminal, or terrorist organizations
* Content depicting hostages or posted with the intent to solicit, threaten, or intimidate on behalf of a criminal, extremist, or terrorist organization
* Content that depicts the insignia, logos, or symbols of violent extremist, criminal, or terrorist organizations in order to praise or promote them
* Content that glorifies or promotes violent tragedies, such as school shootings

YouTube relies on many factors, including government and international organization designations, to determine what constitutes criminal or terrorist organizations. For example, we terminate any channel where we have reasonable belief that the account holder is a member of a designated terrorist organization, such as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (U.S.), or organization identified by the United Nations.

If posting content related to terrorism or crime for an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose, be mindful to provide enough information in the video or audio itself so viewers understand the context. Graphic or controversial footage with sufficient context may be subject to age-restrictions or a warning screen.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

* Raw and unmodified reuploads of content created by terrorist, criminal, or extremist organizations
* Celebrating terrorist leaders or their crimes in songs or memorials
* Celebrating terrorist or criminal organizations in songs or memorials
* Content directing users to sites that espouse terrorist ideology, are used to disseminate prohibited content, or are used for recruitment
* Footage filmed by the perpetrator during a deadly or major violent event, in which weapons, violence, or injured victims are visible or audible
* Links to external sites that contain manifestos of violent attackers
* Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) to glorify a violent event, its perpetrators, or support violent criminal or terrorist organizations
* Glorifying violence against civilians
* Fundraising for violent criminal, extremist, or terrorist organizations

Please remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

If your content violates this policy, we'll remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. You can learn more about our strikes system [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

Violations may result in monetization being disabled on any of your accounts in accordance with our [YouTube channel monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392). This can include warnings. If you feel this is a mistake, you can appeal. If the violation is overturned, you can apply for monetization once you're eligible in YouTube Studio.

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

Hate speech is not allowed on YouTube. We don’t allow content that promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on any of the following attributes, which indicate a protected group status under YouTube’s policy:

* Age
* Caste, Ethnicity, or Race
* Disability
* Immigration Status
* Nationality
* Religion
* Sex, Gender, or Sexual Orientation
* Veteran Status
* Victims of a major violent event and their kin

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if the purpose of that content is to do one or more of the following:

* Encourage violence against individuals or groups based on their protected group status. We don’t allow threats on YouTube, and we treat implied calls for violence as real threats. You can learn more about our policies on [threats and harassment](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268).
* Incite hatred against individuals or groups based on their protected group status.

Other types of content that violates this policy
------------------------------------------------

* Dehumanization of individuals or groups by calling them subhuman, comparing them to animals, insects, pests, disease, or any other non-human entity based on their protected group status.
* Praise or glorification of violence against individuals or groups based on their protected group status.
* Use of racial, religious, or other slurs and stereotypes that incite or promote hatred based on protected group status. This can take the form of speech, text, or imagery promoting these stereotypes or treating them as factual.
* Claim that individuals or groups are physically or mentally inferior, deficient, or diseased based on their protected group status. This includes statements that one group is less than another, calling them less intelligent or less capable. This also includes calls for the subjugation or domination over individuals or groups based on their protected group status.
* Promotion of hateful supremacism by alleging the superiority of a group over those with protected group status to justify violence, discrimination, segregation, or exclusion. This includes content containing hateful supremacist propaganda, such as the recruitment of new members or requests for financial support for their ideology, and music videos promoting hateful supremacism in the lyrics, metadata, or imagery.
* Conspiratorial claims that individuals or groups are evil, corrupt, or malicious based on their protected group status.
* Denial or minimization of a well-documented, major violent event or the victimhood of such an event.

Educational, documentary, scientific, and artistic content
----------------------------------------------------------

We may allow content that includes hate speech if that content includes additional educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context. Additional context may include condemning, refuting, including opposing views, or satirizing hate speech. This is not a pass to promote hate speech. Examples include:

* **A documentary about a hate group:** Educational content that isn’t supporting the group or promoting ideas would be allowed. A documentary promoting violence or hatred wouldn’t be allowed.
* **A documentary about the scientific study of humans:** A documentary about how theories have changed over time, even if it includes theories about the inferiority or superiority of specific groups, would be allowed because it’s educational. We won’t allow a documentary claiming there's scientific evidence today that an individual or group is inferior or subhuman.
* Historical footage of an event, like WWII, which doesn't promote violence or hatred.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that includes hate speech, this context must appear in the images or audio of the video itself. Providing it in the title or description is insufficient.

Monetization and other penalties
--------------------------------

In some rare cases, we may remove content or issue other penalties when a creator:

* Repeatedly encourages abusive audience behavior.
* Repeatedly targets, insults, and abuses a group based on protected group status across multiple uploads.
* Exposes a group with protected group status to risks of physical harm based on the local social or political context.
* Creates content that harms the YouTube ecosystem by persistently inciting hostility against a group with protected group status for personal financial gain.

Examples
--------

Here are examples of hate speech not allowed on YouTube.

* “I’m glad this \[violent event\] happened. They got what they deserved \[referring to people with protected group status\].”
* “\[People with protected group status\] are dogs” or “\[people with protected group status\] are like animals.”

More examples
-------------

* “Get out there and punch a \[person with protected group status\].”
* “\[Person with protected group status\] is scum of the earth.”
* “\[People with protected group status\] are a disease.”
* “\[People with protected group status\] are less intelligent than us because their brains are smaller.”
* “\[Group with protected group status\] have an agenda to run the world and get rid of us.”
* “\[Person with protected group status\] shouldn't be educated in schools because they shouldn't be educated at all.”
* “All of the so-called victims of this violent event are actors. No one was hurt, and this is just a false flag.”
* “People died in the event, but a truly insignificant number.”
* Shouting “\[people with protected group status\] are pests!” at someone regardless of whether the person does or does not have the alleged protected group status.
* Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) to promote violence or hatred against a group with any of the attributes noted above.

Please remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

* Content that contains prolonged insults or slurs based on someone's intrinsic attributes. These attributes include their [protected group status](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939), physical attributes, or their status as a survivor of sexual assault, non-consensual intimate imagery distribution, domestic abuse, child abuse and more.
* Content uploaded with the intent to shame, deceive or insult a minor. This means intending to make a minor feel unpleasant emotions, like distress, shame, or worthlessness; intending to trick them to behave in ways that may harm themselves or their property; or engaging in name-calling toward them. We also prohibit content that incites bullying against a minor. A minor is someone under 18 years old.

Other types of content that violate this policy

* Content that shares, threatens to share, or encourages others to share non-public personally identifiable information (PII).
    * PII includes, but isn’t limited to, home addresses; email addresses; sign-in credentials, like a username or password; phone numbers; passport numbers; medical records; bank account information; or the name of a school a minor attends.
    * This doesn't include posting widely available public information, like an official’s office phone number or the phone number of a business.
    * This policy applies to sharing your own PII, sharing someone else’s PII, and situations where you accidentally share PII.
    * Content must clearly indicate when fake PII is shared. For example, using fake login credentials as part of a training.
* Content that encourages abusive behavior, like brigading. Brigading is when an individual encourages the coordinated abuse of an identifiable individual on or off YouTube.
* Content that promotes harmful conspiracy theories or that targets someone by claiming they’re a part of a harmful conspiracy theory. A harmful conspiracy theory is one that has been linked to direct threats or violent acts.
* Content that threatens an identifiable individual or their property. This includes implicit threats that don’t specify a time or place but may feature a weapon, for example.
* Content that depicts a staged meet-up that is used to accuse an identifiable individual of egregious misconduct with a minor, without the presence of law enforcement.
* Content that depicts vigilantes restraining or assaulting individuals, or engaging in a dangerous or reckless vehicle pursuit to apprehend an individual.
* Content reveling in or mocking the death or serious injury of an identifiable individual.
* Content that realistically simulates deceased or abused individuals describing their death or violence experienced.
* Content that depicts creators simulating acts of serious violence against others. For example, executions, torture, maimings, beatings, and more.
* Content that contains stalking of an identifiable individual.
* Content that denies or minimizes someone’s role as a victim of a well-documented, major violent event.
* Content that contains unwanted sexualization of an identifiable individual. This includes:
    * Content that describes someone in a lewd, degrading, and sexually explicit manner
    * Content that shares, requests or shows how to distribute non-consensual intimate imagery
    * Content that fantasizes about, threatens, or supports sexual assault

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Note that these policies also apply to [external links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video and other forms.

Exceptions
----------

If the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic in nature, we may allow content that includes harassment. These exceptions are not a pass to harass someone. Some examples include:

* **Debates related to high-profile officials or leaders:** Content featuring debates or discussions of topical issues concerning individuals who have positions of power, like high-profile government officials or CEOs of major multinational corporations.
* **Scripted performances:** Insults made in the context of an artistic medium such as scripted satire, stand up comedy, or music (such as a diss track). Note: This exception is not a pass to harass someone and claim “I was joking.”
* **Harassment education or awareness:** Content that features actual or simulated harassment for documentary purposes or with willing participants (such as actors) to combat cyberbullying or raise awareness.

Note: We take a harder line on content that maliciously insults someone based on their [protected group status](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en), regardless of whether or not they are a high-profile individual.

Monetization and other penalties
--------------------------------

In some rare cases, we may remove content or issue other penalties when a creator:

* Repeatedly encourages abusive audience behavior.
* Repeatedly targets, insults and abuses an identifiable individual based on their intrinsic attributes across several uploads.
* Exposes an individual to risks of physical harm based on the local social or political context.
* Creates content that harms the YouTube community by persistently inciting hostility between creators for personal financial gain.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube:

* Repeatedly showing pictures of someone and then making statements like “Look at this creature’s teeth, they’re so disgusting!”, with similar commentary targeting intrinsic attributes throughout the video.
* Targeting an individual based on their membership in a [protected group](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939), such as by saying: “Look at this \[slur targeting a protected group\]!”
* Using an extreme insult to dehumanize an individual based on their intrinsic attributes. For example: “Look at this dog of a woman! She's got the face of an animal and her body is mangy, just like a dog's!”
* Targeting an individual and expressing a wish for their death or serious injury: “I hate her so much. I wish she’d just get hit by a truck and die.”
* Depicting an identifiable individual being murdered or seriously injured. For example: A video includes a clip from a movie, where one character is brutally shot and killed. The video is edited so that a real individual’s photo is placed over the actor’s face.
* Threatening someone’s physical safety. This includes explicit threats like, “When I see you on Saturday, I’m going to kill you.” This also includes implying violence by making statements like, “You better watch out, I’m coming for you” while brandishing a weapon.
* Posting an individual’s non-public personally identifiable information, like a phone number, home address, or email address, to direct abusive attention or traffic toward them. For example, saying, “I got a hold of their phone number. Call and leave messages until they pick up!”
* “Raiding” or directing malicious abuse to identifiable individuals through in-game voice chat or messages during a stream.
* Directing users to leave abusive comments in another creator's comment section.
* Linking to off platform sites that host or feature non-consensual intimate imagery.
* Requesting that other users get in touch to share non-consensual intimate imagery.
* “Swatting” or other prank calls to emergency or crisis response services, or encouraging viewers to act in this or any other harassing behavior.

**Educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content**
-------------------------------------------------------------

We may allow content that violates the misinformation policies noted on this page if that content includes additional context in the video, audio, title, or description.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. You can learn more about [our strikes system here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate this policy is allowed to stay on YouTube when it has Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a pass to promote misinformation. Additional context may include countervailing views, or if the content condemns, disputes, or satirizes misinformation that violates our policies.

**Note:** YouTube reviews all its Community Guidelines as a normal course of business.  In our [2023 blog post](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/a-long-term-vision-for-medical-misinformation-policies/) we announced ending several of our COVID-19 policies and we have now retired the remaining standalone COVID-19 policies given the reduced burden of disease. Our broader Medical Misinformation framework continues to apply to content related to infectious diseases including influenza and measles.

* Prevention misinformation
* Treatment misinformation

**Note:** YouTube’s medical misinformation policies are subject to change in response to changes to guidance from health authorities. There may be a delay between new guidance and policy updates, and our policies may not cover all LHA guidance related to specific health conditions and substances.

**Treatment misinformation:** We do not allow content that promotes information that contradicts health authority guidance on treatments for specific health conditions, including promotion of specific harmful substances or practices that have not been approved by local health authorities as safe or effective, or that have been confirmed to cause severe harm.

These policies apply to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

**Educational, documentary, scientific or artistic content**
------------------------------------------------------------

We may allow content that violates the misinformation policies noted on this page if that content includes additional context in the video, audio, title, or description. This is not a pass to promote misinformation. Additional context may include countervailing views from local health authorities or medical experts. We may also make exceptions if the purpose of the content is to condemn, dispute, or satirize misinformation that violates our policies. We may also make exceptions for content discussing the results of a specific medical study, or showing an open public forum, like a protest or public hearing, provided the content does not aim to promote misinformation that violates our policies.

YouTube also believes people should be able to share their own experiences, including personal experiences with vaccinations, for example. This means we may make exceptions for content in which creators describe firsthand experiences from themselves or their family. At the same time, we recognize there is a difference between sharing personal experiences and promoting misinformation. To address this balance, we will still remove content or channels if they include other policy violations or demonstrate a pattern of promoting medical misinformation.

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

Familiarize yourself with the rest of our [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567).

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

YouTube doesn’t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community. We also don’t allow content where the main purpose is to trick others into leaving YouTube for another site.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

Content intended to impersonate a person or channel is not allowed on YouTube. YouTube also enforces trademark holder rights. When a channel, or content in the channel, causes confusion about the source of goods and services advertised, it may not be allowed.

If you see content that violates this policy, [report it](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

* If you feel that yours or another creator's channel is being impersonated, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

What these policies mean for you
--------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below. 

* **Channel impersonation:** A channel that copies another channel's profile, background, or overall look and feel in such a way that makes it look like someone else's channel. The channel does not have to be 100% identical, as long as the intent is clear to copy the other channel.
* **Personal impersonation:** Content intended to look like someone else is posting it.

If you operate a fan channel, make sure you state so explicitly in your channel name or [handle](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11585688). It should be obvious to your viewers that your channel doesn't represent the original creator, artist or entity your channel is celebrating.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

* Channels with the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image as another channel, with the only difference being a space inserted into the name or a zero replacing the letter O.
* Using someone else's real name, user name, image, brand, logo, or other personal information to trick people into believing you are that person. 
* Setting up a channel using the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image of a person, and then pretending that person is posting content to the channel.
* Setting up a channel using the name and image of a person, and then posting comments on other channels as if they were posted by the person.
* Channels claiming to be a 'fan account' in the channel description, but not stating so clearly in the channel name or handle, or posing as another’s channel and reuploading their content.
* Channels impersonating an existing news channel.

Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

Links can take any form that would direct a user to a site off YouTube. These links include: clickable URLs, showing text of URLs in videos or images, and obfuscated URLs (such as writing “dot com” instead of “.com”). These links can also include verbally directing users to other sites, encouraging viewers to visit creator profiles or pages on other sites, or promising violative content on other sites. This list is not complete.

**Note:** Affiliate content doesn't violate YouTube’s Terms of Use. Excessively posting affiliate content in dedicated accounts may violate our policies around spam. You can learn more about what's allowed in our [Spam, deceptive practices & scams policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973).

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

YouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.

Content and channels that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.

**Important:**  If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.

We consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.  

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

* Links to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers
* Content linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services
* Offering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)
    * **Note**: You're allowed to encourage viewers to subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment
* Content featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

How engagement is measured
--------------------------

Subscriber numbers displayed in the following places update in real time:

* Your channel homepage
* Account switcher
* Video watch page
* Third-party sites and apps using the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)

The number of subscribers in YouTube Analytics may be different than the subscriber count on your YouTube channel. The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are accurate.

Page traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Terminated accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.

If you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/tou_removal_appeal) in the Help Center to learn more.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

* A video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party
* A video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”
* A video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)
* Channels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose

Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued.

If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

Playlists are a great way to combine videos that your community may want to watch as a series. We know it’s not often intentional, but there may be times when playlists contain content that’s not allowed on the platform and can cause harm to our community. This means that playlists that violate our Community Guidelines are not allowed on YouTube.

Here’s a simple way to think of it: if you were to combine all the playlists’ videos into one single video, and that video were to violate our Community Guidelines, then the playlist may violate Community Guidelines as well.

If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you find many videos, comments, or a creator's entire channel that you wish to report, visit our [reporting tool](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

#### If you're creating playlists 

Don’t post playlists on YouTube if they fit any of the descriptions noted below.

* Playlists with thumbnails, titles or descriptions that violate our community guidelines, such as those that are pornographic, or that consist of images that are intended to shock or disgust.
* Playlists with titles or descriptions that mislead viewers into thinking they’re about to view videos different than what the playlist contains.
* Playlists with videos that don’t individually violate our policies, but are collected in a way that violates the guidelines. This includes but is not limited to: 
    * Educational content featuring nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification 
    * Non-sexual content but focus on specific body parts or activities for sexual gratification 
    * Documentary videos of graphic violence for the purpose of glorifying or shocking
* Playlists that include multiple videos that have been removed for violating our guidelines. If you notice that multiple videos in your public playlists have been removed or deleted, please take some time to remove those videos from your playlists as well. If you notice that some videos in your public playlists violate our Community Guidelines, please flag them and remove them from your playlist.
* Playlists that depict physical, sexual, or emotional mistreatment of minors.

Please note this is not a complete list.

* A playlist of videos featuring minors accompanied by a title such as “sexy".

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

Additional policies
===================

Encouraging Terms of Service violations
---------------------------------------

If you post content that encourages other users to violate our Terms of Service, the content may be removed, your account may be penalized, and in some cases your account may be terminated.

Posting previously removed content, or content from terminated or restricted creators
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posting content previously removed for violating our Terms of Service, content from creators with a current [channel restriction](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032), or content from creators who have been terminated is considered circumvention under our Terms of Service.

If you post such content, it may be removed, and your YouTube channel may also be penalized or [terminated](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168). This may also apply to other channels you own.

Age requirements on Google products
-----------------------------------

We may ask you to confirm your age if we think that you are not old enough to use YouTube. You can learn more about this process [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1333913).

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

Explicit content meant to be sexually gratifying is not allowed on YouTube. Posting pornography may result in content removal or channel termination. Videos containing fetish content will be removed or age-restricted. In most cases, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes are not allowed on YouTube.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors is not allowed on YouTube. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

#### If you're posting content

Explicit content that violates this policy could result in channel termination. This policy applies to real-world, dramatized, illustrated, and animated content, including sex scenes, video games, and music.

Don’t post content on YouTube if it shows:

* The depiction of clothed or unclothed genitals, breasts, or buttocks that are meant for sexual gratification.
* Pornography, the depiction of sexual acts, or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification.

Other types of content that violate this policy
-----------------------------------------------

* Masturbation
* Fondling or groping of genitals, breasts, or buttocks
* Using sex toys to give viewers sexual gratification
* Nudity or partial nudity that’s meant for sexual gratification
* Non-consensual sex acts or the promotion or glorification of non-consensual sex acts, such as sexual assault, incest, bestiality, or zoophilia
* Unwanted sexualization such as non-consensually shared imagery or voyeurism
* Wardrobe accidents or nude photo leaks
* Non-consensual zooming in or prolonged focused or emphasis on the breasts, buttocks or genital area for the purpose of sexual gratification
* Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
* Aggregating content that’s meant for sexual gratification
* Any sexual content involving minors—see our [Child Safety on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801999) page for more information

**Note:** The above list isn't complete.

Age-restricted content

We may age-restrict content if it includes nudity or other sexual content but doesn’t depict anything described above. We consider the following when deciding whether to age-restrict or remove content.

* Whether clothed or unclothed breasts, buttocks or genitals are the focal point of the video
* Whether the subject is depicted in a pose that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
* Whether the language used in the video is graphic or lewd
* Whether the subject's actions in the video encourage sexual arousal, such as by touching of breasts or genitals, or revealing undergarments
* Whether the clothing would be generally unacceptable in public contexts, such as lingerie
* Whether sexual imagery or audio has been blurred, masked, or obscured
* Whether sexual imagery or audio is fleeting or prolonged in the content
* Whether the content invites others to participate in a challenge involving sexual acts

**Note:** The above list isn’t complete.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

Educational content
-------------------

We may allow sexual content when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, a documentary on breast cancer that shows nude breasts would be appropriate, but posting clips out of context to sexually gratify from the same documentary is not. Out of context nudity in indigenous communities, during medical procedures, during childbirth, during artistic performances, or during breastfeeding may not meet our documentary exception.

The same applies to depictions of sex scenes in artistic content such as films, audio stories, music or video games. For example, a film with a sex scene may be allowed if it included details such as the name of the film, director, actors in the video content and in the video description. Remember that [giving context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162) in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.

For educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content that has adult material or graphic violence, we may take into account official third-party ratings to decide whether the content may remain on YouTube. Content that follows our policies but isn’t appropriate for all audiences is [age-restricted](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167). Age-restricted content isn’t viewable to anyone who’s under 18 years of age or signed out.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

* Clips extracted from non-pornographic films, shows, or other content in order to isolate sexual content (real world or artistic)
* Groping, kissing, public masturbation, “upskirting”, voyeurism, predatory exhibitionism, or any other content that depicts someone in a sexualized manner without their consent
* Content that depicts sexual acts, behaviors, or sex toys that’s meant for sexual gratification

**Note:** The above are just some examples. If you think content might violate this policy, don’t post it.

More examples
-------------

* Playlists that aggregate content containing nudity or sexual themes for the purpose of sexual gratification
* Provocative dancing that is focused on the dancer’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or that includes fondling or groping
* Content that sexualizes rape in any form, or content that aggregates clips of dramatized rape scenes
* Audio or textual depictions of sexual acts for the purpose of sexual gratification
* Content showing bodily fluids or excretion, such as urine, for the purpose of sexual gratification
* Content using otherwise everyday objects or scenarios, such as injections or eating, for the purpose of sexual gratification
* Video game content which has been developed or modified (“modded”) for sexual gratification, or focuses on themes of unwanted sexualization
    

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

If your content contains pornography, we may terminate your channel.

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

Thumbnails and other images that violate our [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) aren’t allowed on YouTube. Images include banners, avatars, posts, and any other YouTube feature that has images.

If you find thumbnails or other images that violate this policy, [report them](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you find a few videos or comments that you want to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

Don’t post a thumbnail or other image on YouTube if it shows:

* Pornographic imagery
* Sexual acts, the use of sex toys, fetishes, or other sexually gratifying imagery
* Nudity, including genitals
* Imagery that depicts unwanted sexualization
* Violent imagery that intends to shock or disgust
* Graphic or disturbing imagery with blood or gore
* Vulgar or lewd language
* A thumbnail that misleads viewers to think they’re about to view something that’s not in the video

**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.

Age-restricted thumbnails and thumbnail removal
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes, a thumbnail may not be appropriate for all audiences, but it doesn’t violate our Community Guidelines. When that happens, we may age-restrict the video, or we may remove the thumbnail, but we don’t issue a strike on your channel. If we remove a thumbnail, we let you know, and you can upload another thumbnail.

Here’s what we consider when we remove or age-restrict these kinds of thumbnails:

* Whether breasts, buttocks, or genitals are the focal point of the thumbnail
* Whether the subject is depicted in a pose or clothing that is intended to sexually arouse the viewer
* Whether violent or gory imagery is the focal point of the thumbnail
* Whether written text is intended to be vulgar or shock or disgust viewers
* Whether the title, description, tags, or other data indicate an intent to shock or disgust viewers

What happens when thumbnails violate our policies
-------------------------------------------------

If your thumbnail contains pornography, we may terminate your channel. If your thumbnail violates other policies, we remove the thumbnail and may issue a strike against your account. If it's the first time you’ve posted content that violates our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. However, if one of your thumbnails violates the same policy within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get three strikes in 90 days or your channel is dedicated to violative content, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about our [strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

**Update:** Content that targets young minors and families but contains sexual themes, violence, obscene, or other mature themes not suitable for young audiences, is not allowed on YouTube. In addition to your titles, descriptions, and tags, ensure your [audience selection](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076) matches the audience your content is suitable for.

YouTube doesn’t allow content that endangers the emotional and physical well-being of minors. A minor is someone under 18 years old.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. If you believe that a child is in danger, you should get in touch with your local law enforcement to report the situation immediately.

Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions below.

* **Sexualization of minors:** Sexually explicit content featuring minors and content that sexually exploits minors including minor nudity posted with comedic intent. We report content containing child sexual abuse imagery to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.com/home), who work with global law enforcement agencies.
* **Harmful or dangerous acts involving minors:** Content showing a minor participating in dangerous activities or encouraging minors to do dangerous activities, particularly if someone watching could imitate the dangerous act or if the content encourages or praises the dangerous act. Never put minors in harmful situations that may lead to injury, including dangerous stunts, challenges, dares, or pranks. Dangerous acts include, but are not limited to, any act in the categories listed under Extremely Dangerous challenges, such as asphyxiation or electrocution.
    * Examples include content that shows minors:
        * Drinking alcohol
        * Using vaporizers, e-cigarettes, tobacco, or marijuana
        * Misusing fireworks
        * Using firearms unsupervised
* Inflicting or advocating for the infliction of physical, sexual or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child, including inflicting emotional distress on minors.
    * Content that contains infliction of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of a child within an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context and with blurring may receive an exception.
    * Content that could cause minor participants or viewers emotional distress, including:
        * Exposing minors to mature themes
        * Simulating parental abuse
        * Coercing minors
        * Violence
* **Misleading family content:** Content that targets young minors and families, but contains:
    * Sexual themes
    * Violence
    * Obscenity or other mature themes not suitable for young audiences
    * Medical procedures
    * Self harm
    * Use of adult horror characters
    * Other inappropriate themes intended to shock young audiences
    * Content that targets young minors and families with age-inappropriate themes within an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context may receive an exception. This is not a pass to target young minors and families with mature themes intended to shock young audiences.
    * Family friendly cartoons that target young minors and contain adult or age-inappropriate themes such as violence, sex, death, drugs, and more. We don’t allow content labeled as suitable for kids in the video's title, description, tags, or in the audience selection if it contains age-inappropriate themes.
    * Make sure your titles, descriptions, and tags match the audience you're targeting. In addition, ensure your [audience selection](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076) accurately represents the audience your content is suitable for. You can also age restrict your content upon upload if it’s intended for [mature audiences](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2950063).
* **Cyberbullying and harassment involving minors:** Content that:
    * Intends to shame, deceive or insult a minor
    * Reveals personal information like email addresses or bank account numbers
    * Contains sexualization
    * Encourages others to bully or harass

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, posts, live streams, playlists, and any other YouTube product or feature. Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

Please note these policies also apply to [external links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

Age-restricted content

We may add an age restriction to content that includes any of the following.

* **Harmful or dangerous acts that adults or minors could imitate:** Content containing adults participating in dangerous activities that adults or minors could easily imitate.
    * **Note:** Simply saying, “Don’t try this at home” may not result in an exception. Learn more about [age restricted Harmful or Dangerous content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801964#age_restricted_removal).
* **Adult themes in family content:** Content meant for adult audiences but could easily be confused with family content. This includes cartoons that contain adult themes such as violence, sex, or death. Remember you can age restrict your content upon upload if it’s intended for [mature audiences](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2950063).
* **Vulgar language:** Some language is not appropriate for younger audiences. Content using sexually explicit language or excessive profanity may lead to age restriction.

Content featuring minors

To protect minors on YouTube, content that doesn’t violate our policies but depicts children or is uploaded by minors may have some features disabled at both the channel and content level. These features may include:

* Comments
* Live chat
* Live streaming
* Video recommendations (how and when your video is recommended)
* Posts
* Shorts Video remixing

**Note:**

* We may also apply stricter display standards to comments, posts, and live chat messages on channels owned by minors or associated with content depicting or uploaded by minors.
* Live streams with minors under 16 who are not visibly accompanied by an adult may be removed or have their live chat disabled. Channels not in compliance with this policy may temporarily or permanently lose their ability to live stream or access to other features. 

**How to protect minors in your content**

Before posting content of yourself, your family, or friends, think carefully about whether it may put anyone at risk of negative attention. Minors are a vulnerable population, and YouTube has policies to protect them from unwanted attention.

* Make sure the minor is supervised by an adult and is performing age-appropriate activities such as demonstrating hobbies, educational content or public performances.
* Make sure the attire worn is age-appropriate. Avoid attire that overexposes the minor or is form-fitting.
* Use YouTube's [privacy settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177) to limit who can see the videos you post.

**Don’t post content on YouTube that features minors and meets one or more of the following:**

* Filmed in private spaces at home such as bedrooms or bathrooms.
* Features minors soliciting contact from strangers, dares or challenges online, or discussing adult topics.
* Shows activities that could draw undesired attention to the minor, such as performing body contortions or ASMR.
* Reveals personal details about a minor.

These are just some examples, you can get more best practices for [child safety here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9229229). If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority in your country, [Be internet awesome](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/) can help you be safe online.

Here are some examples of content not allowed on YouTube.

* Videos or posts featuring minors involved in provocative, sexual, or sexually suggestive activities, challenges and dares, such as kissing or groping.
* Showing minors involved in dangerous activities. For example, physical stunts, using weapons or explosives, or using a controlled substance like alcohol or nicotine including use of vapes or e-cigarettes.
* A video with tags like "for children", or whose audience is set to “Yes, it’s made for kids”, featuring family friendly cartoons engaging in inappropriate acts like injecting needles.

Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

More examples
-------------

* Offering money, praise, likes, or any other incentive to a minor to participate in physical contact with someone else.
* A video or post that advertises sexual content featuring minors or abusive content featuring minors.
* Predatory behavior involving communications with or about minors.
* Aggregating innocent content of minors for the purposes of sexual gratification.
* Fight or bullying content featuring kids without educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context and blurring.
* Challenges, pranks, or stunts that pose the risk of physical injury or serious emotional distress. You can learn more about what’s not allowed in our policies [around challenges and pranks](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801964).
* Encouraging minors to participate in dangerous activities, even if there are no minors in the content.
* Content simulating parental abuse or abandonment, simulating exposure to death or violence, or causing minors intense shame or humiliation.
* Using cartoons, puppets, or family entertainment characters to appeal to children where content features adult themes like violence and sex.

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

We have zero tolerance for predatory behavior on YouTube. If we think a child is in danger based on reported content, we’ll help law enforcement investigate the content.

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

At YouTube, we take the health and well-being of all our creators and viewers seriously. Awareness and understanding of mental health is important and we support creators sharing their stories, such as posting content discussing their experiences with depression, self-harm, eating disorders, or other mental health issues.

However, we do not allow content on YouTube that promotes suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders, that is intended to shock or disgust, or that poses a considerable risk to viewers.

What to do if you find this content
-----------------------------------

If you believe someone is in danger:

* Get in touch with local emergency services for help
* [Flag the video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027) to bring it to our attention

If you find yourself being negatively affected by any mental health, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related content you come across, know that there is support available and you’re not alone. In the next section you can find a list of resources and contact information for organizations that can offer advice.

For general guidance on how to talk to someone who you may be concerned about, contact local helplines.

What to do if you need support
------------------------------

If you are depressed, having thoughts of suicide, self-harming, or experiencing an eating disorder, know there is help and you’re not alone. While coping with painful emotions, many people might experience these issues. Talking to a mental health care provider can help determine if you have a mental illness that requires care. It can also help you identify healthy, effective coping strategies and develop skills to manage difficult feelings.

Community Guidelines for posting suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder-related content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.

However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.

To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/9387060).

This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list. Please note these policies also apply to [external links](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9054257) in your content. This can include clickable URLs, verbally directing users to other sites in video, as well as other forms.

#### Don't post the following content:

* Content promoting or glorifying suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders
* Instructions on how to die by suicide, engage in self-harm, or engage in eating disorders (including how to conceal them)
* Content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders that is targeted at minors
* Graphic images of self-harm
* Visuals of bodies of suicide victims unless blurred or covered so they are fully obscured
* Videos showing the lead-up to a suicide, or suicide attempts and suicide rescue footage without [sufficient context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162)
* Content showing participation in or instructions for suicide and self-harm challenges (e.g. Blue Whale or Momo challenges)
* Suicide notes or letters without [sufficient context](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6345162)
* Content that features weight-based bullying in the context of eating disorders

In some cases we may restrict, rather than remove, suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder content if it meets one or more of the following criteria (for example, by placing an [age-restriction](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167), a warning, or a [Crisis Resource Panel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10726080) on the video).

### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:

* Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801895).
* Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
* Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
* Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
* Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
* Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9057652).

We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:

* Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
* Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
* Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

What happens if content violates this policy
--------------------------------------------

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032).

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168).

Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en)

### **Warnings and supportive resources**

YouTube may show features or resources to users when content contains suicide or self-harm topics. For example:

* A warning on your video before it starts playing, indicating that it contains content relating to suicide and self-harm
* A [panel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10726080) under the video containing supportive resources such as phone numbers of suicide prevention organizations

The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority. We look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community. It’s important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe. Take the time to carefully read the policy below. You can also check out [this page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567) for a full list of our guidelines.

Some language may not be appropriate for viewers under 18.

If you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines [are available here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). If you've found a few videos or comments that you would like to report, you can [report the channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027#report_channel).

What this policy means for you
------------------------------

**If you're posting content**

Explicit content that violates this policy could result in [age restriction](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167), content removal, or a [strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032). We may consider the following factors when deciding whether to age-restrict, remove content, or issue a strike.

* Use of sexually explicit language or narratives
* Use of excessive profanity in the content 
* Use of heavy profanity or sexually suggestive terms in the content’s title, thumbnail, or associated metadata
* Use of excessive sexual sounds

**Note**: The above list isn’t complete.

Age-restricted content
----------------------

Here are some examples of content that may be age-restricted:

* A video focused on the use of profanities, like a compilation, song, or clip taken out of context
* A video that uses heavy profanities in the title 
* A video that repeatedly uses vulgar or sexual language

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, audio, and any other YouTube product or feature. Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.

We may allow vulgar language when the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic, and it isn’t gratuitous. For example, the title of a song with a curse word or a song that contains large amounts of profanity. Remember that giving context in the content, title, and description will help us and your viewers determine the primary purpose of the video.
