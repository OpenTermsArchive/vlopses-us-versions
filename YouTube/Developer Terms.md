Accordingly, you agree that YouTube will be entitled to seek temporary or permanent injunctive relief against any violation or threatened violation of such limitations or restrictions in any court of competent jurisdiction.
     
23.  23\. Non-assert
     ---------------
     
     **Non-assert.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, during the Agreement, and for three (3) years after any termination or expiration of the Agreement by you or YouTube, you agree not to assert, or authorize, assist or encourage any third party to assert, any patent infringement claim against YouTube, its Affiliates, or any Related Parties, to the extent such claims relate to any of the YouTube API Services that you or your API Client(s) accessed or used. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should YouTube or Google Inc. first file a patent infringement claim in a lawsuit against you (excluding a patent infringement claim brought by YouTube or Google Inc. in response to a lawsuit, for example, as a cross-claim or counterclaim), then the non-assert provision in the first sentence of this Section will be suspended only for the duration of YouTube’s or Google Inc’s first patent infringement claim against you (for example, until such patent infringement claim is settled, withdrawn, dismissed, or otherwise disposed of).
     
24.  24\. Termination
     ----------------
     
     **Termination.**
     
     24.1 **Termination by You.** You may terminate your legal agreement with YouTube by terminating your access to and use of the YouTube API Services (including discontinuing access to and use by your API Client(s) and those acting on your behalf) at any time. You do not need to specifically inform YouTube when you stop using and accessing the YouTube API Services unless otherwise required by YouTube.
     
     24.2 **Termination by YouTube.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, YouTube reserves the right to (i) suspend or terminate access to, or use of, any aspects of the YouTube API Services by you, your API Client(s) and those acting on your behalf), and (ii) terminate the Agreement (or any portion thereof), as applied to any specific user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients at any time. For example, we may need to exercise such rights in instances of your breach of this Agreement, court order, when we believe there to have been misconduct or conduct which may create potential liability for YouTube or its Affiliates. Although we will try to give you reasonable notice, we have no obligation to do so.
     
     24.3 **Effect of Termination.** Upon any suspension, notice of any discontinuance, or termination (whether by you or YouTube), you will immediately stop accessing and using all YouTube Property and delete all YouTube API Services (including all API Data) and YouTube Confidential Information in your possession or control, including from your servers. At YouTube’s request, you will certify your deletion of all YouTube API Services (including all API Data) and YouTube Confidential Information in your possession or control in writing that is signed by your authorized representative who has the authority to bind you. YouTube may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with credentials assigned to you or your API Client(s) to provide notice of both the suspension or termination of your access to, or use of, the YouTube API Services and the display of any advertisements associated with your API Client(s) (where applicable).
     
     24.4 **Termination of Support or Modification Efforts.** If YouTube elects to provide you or your API Client(s) with support or modification for the YouTube API Services, this support or modification may be suspended or terminated by YouTube at any time without notice to you, as applied to any specific YouTube API Services user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients.
     
     24.5 **No Obligation to Provide.** YouTube is under no obligation to provide the YouTube API Services. It is solely your responsibility at all times to be prepared to conduct your business and operate your API Client(s) without access to any aspect of the YouTube API Services.
     
     24.6 **Survival.** The following Sections of these Terms of Service will continue to apply indefinitely even upon any termination or expiration of the Agreement as applied to any specific user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients at any time: 1 (Definitions), 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (The Agreement), 3.3 (Permitted Access and Use of the YouTube API Services), 8 (Security) to the extent applicable data is in the process of deletion upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, 10.2 (Brand Features and Attribution), 13 (Publicity), 16 (No Implied Rights), 17 (Non-exclusive), 18 (Confidentiality), 19 (Exclusion of Warranties), 20 (Limitation of Liability), 21 (Indemnification), 22 (Injunctive Relief), 24 (Termination), and 25 (General Legal Terms).
     
25.  25\. General Legal Terms
     ------------------------
     
     **General Legal Terms.**
     
     25.1 **Entire Agreement.** The Agreement controls the relationship between you and YouTube and constitutes the entire agreement between such parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     
     25.2 **Third-Party Beneficiary.** Each Affiliate of YouTube is a third-party beneficiary under the Agreement and is entitled to directly rely on and enforce any right or benefit provided to it under the Agreement. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement.
     
     25.3 **No Waiver.** YouTube will not be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under the Agreement. A waiver will be effective only if YouTube expressly states in writing signed by an authorized representative that YouTube is waiving a specified term of the Agreement.
     
     25.4 **Severability.** If it turns out that a particular provision of the Agreement is found to be not enforceable, that provision will be modified by the court of competent jurisdiction to the extent necessary to create an enforceable provision that reflects the parties' intention as closely as possible. If that is not possible, it will be deemed deleted and the rest of the Agreement will continue in force unaffected.
     
     25.5 **Requesting Agreement Modifications.** You may grant approvals, permissions and consents to YouTube by email, but any modifications requested by you to the Agreement must be made in writing (not including email) and signed by both YouTube and your authorized representative who has the authority to bind you (and only if YouTube agrees to such modification).
     
     25.6 **Notices.** All notices to YouTube must be in the English language, in writing, and sent to our corporate headquarters address listed on our website via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt.
     
     25.7 **Assignment of the Agreement.** YouTube may transfer or assign the Agreement, including any rights and licenses granted under it, to a third party, but you may not.
     
     25.8 **Relationship of the Parties.** You are not YouTube’s legal partner or agent; the parties are independent contractors.
     
     25.9 **Change of Control.** If you or any party operating your API Client(s) on your behalf experience a change of control (for example, through a stock purchase or sale, merger or other form of corporate transaction), you will provide to YouTube a written notice detailing the change of control within 15 calendar days after the change of control via [this form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_change_of_control_form). YouTube will review the completed form and if it is not approved within 45 calendar days after the change of control, your project ID will automatically terminate.
     
     25.10 **YouTube Approvals.** YouTube may deny or grant any consents, approvals, or permissions that are expressly contemplated under the Agreement or otherwise requested by you at our discretion.
     
     25.11 **Governing Law and Venue.** The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services. Subject to Section 22 (Injunctive Relief), all claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., and you and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
     
     25.12 **Limitation on Actions.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE YOUTUBE API SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
     
     25.13 **Translations.** Any local language translation (where applicable) exists for reference purposes only, and only the English version will be legally binding. If there is any inconsistency between the two versions, the English version shall control.

*   These policies govern the use of YouTube API Services, requiring developers to build stable, user-friendly applications that add value to YouTube while adhering to quality, honesty, and user privacy principles.
    
*   API clients must prioritize transparency regarding data usage, ensuring users understand how their information will be used and maintained, as well as properly identifying their purpose for data access, and providing clear methods for consent revocation.
    
*   Developers must adhere to strict guidelines on API access, usage, quotas, and compliance, including using the Google Developers Console, protecting API credentials, and requesting quota extensions through an API Compliance Audit.
    
*   The handling of YouTube data and content requires developers to obtain user consent, limit data storage durations, and avoid unauthorized activities like downloading content, modifying user data without permission, or aggregating data in prohibited ways.
    
*   API clients are prohibited from actions such as disrupting YouTube API Services, defrauding others, infringing copyrights, or selling ads on YouTube content, and child-directed API clients must comply with specific laws and restrictions like COPPA and GDPR.
    

**Note:** [Complying with the YouTube Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide) provides guidance and examples to help you ensure that your API clients follow specific portions of the YouTube API Services [Terms](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) and [Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) (API TOS). The guide offers insight into how YouTube enforces certain aspects of the API TOS, but it does not replace any existing documents.

This document (the "**YouTube API Services Policies**" or "**Policies**") sets out the policies that you need to follow when accessing or using [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) in your service, product, or application. These Policies help you access and use [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) in ways that are consistent with YouTube's interests and that respect and foster the growth of YouTube's community of creators, viewers, content rights holders, and advertisers.

In addition to defining policies, this document explains some of the underlying principles that YouTube followed in creating these Policies. It also offers examples that demonstrate how these Policies would apply in practice.

Please note that this is a legal document and that these Policies are a component of the [Agreement](#definition-agreement), so you must comply with them. YouTube reserves the right to change these Policies, and your continued access to, or use of, [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) constitutes your agreement to and acceptance of any such changes. Policy changes, like changes to the YouTube API Services [Terms of Service](#definition-terms-of-service), will be documented in the [Terms of Service Revision History](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/revision-history), and you can subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://developers.google.com/static/youtube/terms/feeds/api-services-terms-of-service-revision-history.xml) for that revision history to be notified of any such changes.

I. Terminology and style
------------------------

This is a legal document that specifies policies about allowed or prohibited actions. As such, it uses certain terms to specifically indicate whether you can or cannot do something. With that in mind, the following terms are used to explain your requirements as related to these Policies:

1.  The terms **must** and required refer to absolute requirements.
2.  The term **must not** refers to an absolute prohibition.
3.  The terms **should**, **should not**, **recommend**, and **recommended** indicate that the statement describes a general best practice. While these terms suggest certain actions or behaviors, they acknowledge that you might decide to follow a different course based on specific aspects of your use case.
4.  The term **may** indicates that an action is optional and left entirely to your discretion or, depending on the context in which it is used, to YouTube's discretion.

In addition, the [Definitions](#iv.-definitions) section that concludes this document identifies other terms that have a very specific meaning when used in this document. For your convenience, this document uses a special style for those terms to so that you can easily identify them in context and link to their definitions.

II. Software Development Principles
-----------------------------------

These principles underlie many of the policies in this document. Even though they might not cover every policy, if you violate or your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) violate any of these principles, you are likely also violating the terms of the [Agreement](#definition-agreement). That said, if local law requires you to do something other than what is stated in these policies -- for example, to store data for a particular length of time -- you should comply with that law.

1.  **Build high-quality applications and maintain them.**
    
    Build stable, easy-to-use, feature-rich [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that bring significant additional value to the YouTube ecosystem and its users. Promptly update [API Clients](#definition-api-client) as the features offered in [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) change.
    
2.  **Be honest and transparent.**
    
    This principle applies to all facets of [API Clients](#definition-api-client) and the way that they interact with users as well as with YouTube. In keeping with this principle, be clear about who you are and what your [API Client](#definition-api-client) does. Don't engage in any deceptive activity or messaging related to your identity, your data collection, storage, sharing, use and deletion practices, actions that your [API Client](#definition-api-client) takes on users' behalf, or anything else. Be honest and do not mislead or confuse users in the way you use and present data.
    
3.  **Give users control.**
    
    Building on the importance of transparency, this principle dictates that users must be aware of and have actively consented to the actions that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) takes on their behalf. It means that users know about and have final authority over any actions the [API Client](#definition-api-client) takes to insert, share, update, or delete their data. It also means that each [API Client](#definition-api-client) must provide a privacy policy that clearly informs users about the information that the [API Client](#definition-api-client) accesses, collects, stores, shares, and otherwise uses.
    
4.  **Respect users' privacy.**
    
    Make sure that your data collection, storage, use, security, and deletion policies and practices protect users. Don't allow unauthorized access to, or use of, user data. Don't store user data indefinitely, and provide a clear, straightforward process for them to delete data in your possession. Finally, don't, and do not make attempts to, request, collect, or store users' YouTube login credentials.
    
5.  **Be a good citizen.**
    
    Don't create [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that encourage or enable people to abuse, threaten, or harass each other. Don't use, distribute, or promote viruses, spyware, malware, or other bad stuff. Don't break the law or encourage or enable others to do so. Hopefully, this is all common sense.
    

III. General Developer Policies
-------------------------------

### A. API Client Terms of Use and Privacy Policies

1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must display a link to YouTube's Terms of Service ([https://www.youtube.com/t/terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms)), and they must also state in their own terms of use that, by using those [API Clients](#definition-api-client), users are agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service.
    
2.  Each [API Client](#definition-api-client) must require users to agree to a privacy policy before users can access the [API Client's](#definition-api-client) features and functionality. The privacy policy must:
    
    1.  be prominently displayed and easily accessible to users at all times,
        
    2.  notify users that the [API Client](#definition-api-client) uses [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services),
        
    3.  reference and link to the Google Privacy Policy at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy,
        
    4.  clearly and comprehensively explain to users what user information, including [API Data](#definition-api-data) relating to users, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) accesses, collects, stores and otherwise uses,
        
    5.  clearly and comprehensively explain how the [API Client](#definition-api-client) uses, processes, and shares the user information described in section (III.A.2.e), including how the information is shared with either internal or external parties,
        
    6.  disclose, if it does so, that the [API Client](#definition-api-client) allows third parties to serve content, including advertisements,
        
    7.  disclose, if it does so, that the [API Client](#definition-api-client) stores, accesses or collects (or allows third parties to do so) information directly or indirectly on or from users' devices, including by placing, accessing or recognizing cookies or similar technology on users' devices or browsers,
        
    8.  if the [API Client](#definition-api-client) accesses or uses [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data), explain that, in addition to the [API Client's](#definition-api-client) normal procedure for deleting stored data, users can revoke that [API Client's](#definition-api-client) access to their data via the Google security settings page at [https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions), and
        
    9.  if the [API Client](#definition-api-client) uses [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data), explain how users can contact the [API Client](#definition-api-client) owner or developer with questions or complaints about the [Client's](#definition-api-client) privacy practices.
        

### B. Maintainability and Deprecation

1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must use the most recent versions of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services). This means that you must be able to update [API Clients](#definition-api-client) when newer versions of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) are released. Non-website [API Clients](#definition-api-client), like mobile apps or installed applications, must be capable of being remotely updated to use the most recent versions of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services). You must update your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) to the most recent versions of the [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) within a specified time period if required by YouTube from time to time (e.g. for critical updates).
    
2.  When YouTube intends to make backward incompatible changes to the [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services), such changes will be documented in the [Terms of Service Revision History](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/revision-history), and you can subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://developers.google.com/static/youtube/terms/feeds/api-services-terms-of-service-revision-history.xml) for that revision history to be notified of any such changes.
    
3.  You must promptly update non-deprecated [API Clients](#definition-api-client) to use newer versions of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) as those versions are released.
    
4.  You must update deprecated versions of your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) to clearly indicate to users that some functions or features of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) might stop working due to the [API Clients'](#definition-api-client) deprecated status.
    

### C. Implementing YouTube Features

1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must also comply with the [Requirements for Minimum Functionality for YouTube API Services](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/required-minimum-functionality) ("**RMF**"). In addition, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not place any limitations on the YouTube functionality required by the RMF.
    
    For example, the RMF states that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) that enables users to upload videos to YouTube must enable those users to set a title for each uploaded video. YouTube's video title field has a maximum length of 100 characters, and an [API Client](#definition-api-client) must not set a shorter maximum length for that field.
    
2.  Any [API Client](#definition-api-client) feature that initiates a user action related to a YouTube resource must be:
    
    1.  clearly and unequivocally identifiable as a YouTube action,
    2.  distinct and not mixed with your [API Client's](#definition-api-client) functionality, and
    3.  clearly initiated by the user.
    
    Examples of YouTube resources include videos, channels, playlists, playlist items, and subscriptions. Examples of actions include playing a video, liking a video, adding a video to a playlist, and subscribing to a channel.
    
3.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that perform write operations may suggest parameter or property values, but users must have final control over the data that will be published to [YouTube Applications](#definition-youtube-applications). Similarly, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not modify user-provided values before sending them to YouTube by truncating, appending, or otherwise altering those values unless the user has explicitly consented to such changes.
    
    [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that suggest values for text fields, like video titles or descriptions, must incorporate relevant keywords into those values. For example an [API Client](#definition-api-client) that suggests video titles should not generate the same default titles for all users.
    
    These examples illustrate how this policy would apply to an [API Client](#definition-api-client) that uploads videos to YouTube:
    
    1.  The [API Client](#definition-api-client) may suggest a video description or pre-populate the video description. However, it must not add information to the video description after it is submitted by the user and before it is sent without the user's prior consent. For example, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) must not append the recording date, [API Client](#definition-api-client) name, or any other text unless the user has explicitly consented to such changes.
        
    2.  An [API Client](#definition-api-client) may provide an option to translate a video title to other languages. However, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) must not add any such translations without the user's consent. In addition, if the [API Client's](#definition-api-client) default behavior is to enable the option to translate the video title, it must clearly present to the user an easy way to disable that behavior.
        
4.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must clearly indicate how user-provided data will be used on YouTube.
    
    This policy is particularly relevant for [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that interface with multiple services and platforms since there may be functional or labeling differences between those services and platforms.
    
    For example, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) enables users to add comments about videos to multiple platforms, including YouTube. Each platform uses a different name to refer to the comment text. So, if the [API Client](#definition-api-client) labels the field "Feedback" in its comment form, it needs to clearly indicate that that value corresponds to the comment text on YouTube.
    
5.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that use search functionality provided by [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) must not modify or replace the text, images, information, or other content of, the search results returned by those Services.
    
    For example, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not merge or intermix results from sources other than YouTube and present them as YouTube search results.
    
6.  An [API Client](#definition-api-client) should not limit or reduce the functionality of a YouTube feature unless that limitation is a core aspect (as described in the examples below) of the [API Client](#definition-api-client) itself and that YouTube feature is not required by the RMF ("**Permitted Feature Limitation**").
    
    1.  **Example 1: Permitted Feature Limitation**
        
        The YouTube Data API service allows a video uploader to provide translations of a video's title. Generally speaking, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) that implements this feature should allow uploaders to translate video titles to any language that YouTube supports. However, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) that is specifically designed to teach users to speak French and that offers a range of features specific to French translations might be justified in only offering users the option to upload French translations of video titles.
        
    2.  **Example 2: Non-permitted Feature Limitation**
        
        A second [API Client](#definition-api-client) supports video uploading to YouTube and two other platforms, and all of those platforms allow the uploader to provide translations of the video's title. However, while YouTube supports more than 70 languages, the other two platforms each support half that number, and the three platforms support 25 languages in common. If the [API Client](#definition-api-client) supports only those 25 languages for translation, then that is a non-permitted feature limitation because the limited set of language options is not a core aspect of the [API Client](#definition-api-client). Instead, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) must offer the full range of languages that YouTube supports.
        
7.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) with Permitted Feature Limitations must explain to users why each limitation is in place and make clear that the limitation is not imposed by YouTube. In many, if not all, cases, there are different ways that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) could provide that information, and you should choose an appropriate method for your [API Client](#definition-api-client). Within this explanation, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) should provide a mechanism for users to access the full feature (such as linking to YouTube Creator Studio or providing an expandable menu within the API Client).
    
    In the example 1 above, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) could explain that video uploaders can add translations for other languages in the YouTube Creator Studio and provide a link to that functionality.
    
8.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that offer features sourced from multiple services and platforms should offer feature parity to the extent that it exists across those sources, providing user choice. When [API Clients](#definition-api-client) include features that are supported on YouTube and on other platforms, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not consistently present YouTube features in a detrimental way (e.g., by only providing those features from other platforms).
    
    For example, suppose an [API Client](#definition-api-client) allows users to upload videos to YouTube and three other platforms, and all of those platforms support the ability to upload captions. If the [API Client](#definition-api-client) also supports caption uploading, then it must support that feature for YouTube.
    

### D. Accessing YouTube API Services

1.  API Credentials
    
    To access or use some [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services), you must first use the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) ([https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)) to create [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) for your [API Project](#definition-api-project). Those credentials enable Google and YouTube to link API activity to a particular [API Project](#definition-api-project) and [API Client](#definition-api-client).
    
    In addition to creating [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials), the Developers Console might require you to provide certain other information, such as identification or contact details, before you can access or use the [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) associated with those credentials. YouTube reserves the right to require you to provide additional information to continue to access or use [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services).
    
    If you need to create [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) to access or use a specific YouTube API service, the documentation for that service explains how to create those credentials. For example, the [YouTube Data API service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application), [YouTube Reporting API service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/reporting/guides/registering_an_application), [YouTube Analytics API service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/reporting/guides/registering_an_application), and [YouTube embedded player](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/required-minimum-functionality#embedded-player-api-client-identity) all document steps for creating [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials). Those steps generally differ slightly from one API service to another. For example:
    
    *   Some services only support authorized API requests, while others support authorized and non-authorized requests.
        
    *   Services often support multiple access scopes. Each scope specifies the resources that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) can retrieve, insert, update, or delete on the user's behalf. Scopes enable [API Clients](#definition-api-client) to only request access to the resources they need, and scopes also enable users to control the amount of access that they grant to those Clients.
        
    
    The following policies also apply to access and use of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services):
    
    1.  You must not mask or misrepresent your identity or your [API Client's](#definition-api-client) identity when accessing or using [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) or when creating an [API Project](#definition-api-project) or [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials).
        
    2.  You must only use [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) assigned to you and to your [API Project](#definition-api-project) to access [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services). Similarly, you must not use any other means to mask or misrepresent your [API Client's](#definition-api-client) access to, or usage of, [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services).
        
    3.  If your [API Client](#definition-api-client) needs to create [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) to access or use [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services), you must create exactly one (1) [API Project](#definition-api-project) for that [API Client](#definition-api-client). Those [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) are intended to be used exclusively by the associated API Client, which means that you must not use that one (1) [API Project](#definition-api-project) for multiple [API Clients](#definition-api-client).
        
    4.  You may share your [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) with agents operating solely on your behalf and under a written duty of confidentiality. However, you must not share or disclose your [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) to any other third party, allow access to or use of your [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) by any other third party, or embed your [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) in open source projects.
        
2.  User Authentication and Authorization
    
    Authentication and authorization refer to the process by which users identify themselves and consent to allow an [API Client](#definition-api-client) to access certain user-specific data. Some [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) do not support access to user-specific data and therefore, do not require any authorization, others require authorization for some requests or data, and still others require authorization for all requests. For example:
    
    *   The YouTube IFrame Player API service, which lets you embed videos in a website, does not require authorization just as users do not need to log in to the YouTube website to watch a video.
    *   The YouTube Data API service requires authorization for some actions. For example, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) can search for public videos but does not need user authorization to do so. However, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) does need user authorization to upload a video to the user's YouTube channel.
    *   The YouTube Analytics API service and YouTube Reporting API service require authorization for all actions.
    
    1.  Authentication
        
        1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not (and must not attempt to) obtain, proxy, request, collect, modify, cache, store, or use any information that the user provides or that YouTube displays to the user during authentication processes, including YouTube user account login credentials like usernames and passwords.
            
        2.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must obtain user consent in accordance with the applicable laws and only request access to authorization scopes that they currently use. The access that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) requests should have a direct and transparent benefit to users of that Client. Do not try to future-proof your access to data by asking for permissions that would enable features that you have not yet built.
            
            For example, the YouTube Data API service supports one authorization scope that grants access to read data and another that grants access to read and write data. If a user granted an [API Client](#definition-api-client) access to the first scope, that [API Client](#definition-api-client) would be able to retrieve information about the current user's YouTube channel. However, if a user granted the [API Client](#definition-api-client) access to the second scope, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) could also upload a video to that channel.
            
            In this scenario, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) that does not support YouTube uploads (or other write-based actions) only needs to request access to the first authorization scope, which is more limited in the privileges it grants. Even if the [API Client's](#definition-api-client) developer plans to eventually introduce support for write-based actions, the developer cannot future-proof the [API Client](#definition-api-client) by requesting access to the authorization scope for writing data before the [Client](#definition-api-client) actually supports features that require that scope.
            
        3.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) should request access to authorization scopes in context whenever possible. By requesting access to user data in context, via incremental authorization, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) enables users to more easily understand why it needs access to that data.
            
    2.  API Client Identification and Representation
        
        1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must clearly and accurately identify to the user the entity or product that is requesting access to user data and the reason for requesting that access;
            
        2.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not mislead users when requesting access to data so that users can make an informed decision about whether to grant access to those Clients. Users should be able to readily understand both the value of providing the data that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) requests access to and the consequences of sharing that data.
            
        3.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must clearly and comprehensively identify to users the purposes for which they access and use user data. [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not use user data for secondary purposes that are not clearly disclosed to users.
            
            Users should not be surprised to learn that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) contains hidden features, services, or actions that are inconsistent with the [Client's](#definition-api-client) marketed purposes.
            
    3.  Revocation
        
        1.  Every [API Client](#definition-api-client) must provide a clearly explained and easy way for users to revoke any authorization consent they have provided to an [API Client](#definition-api-client) to access [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services).
            
            When a user revokes consent through this mechanism, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) must programmatically revoke that token right away to communicate the change in permissions to Google. For example, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) could use a Google API Client Library to revoke the token.
            
            In addition, following revocation of consent through this mechanism, you and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must delete all [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data) that was accessed or stored pursuant to that consent. That deletion should happen as soon as possible and must take place within 7 calendar days of the revocation.
            
        2.  As noted in section (III.A.2.i), every [API Client](#definition-api-client) must include in its Privacy Policy a link to Google's security settings page ([https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions)). When a user revokes consent through that page, you and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must also delete all [API Data](#definition-api-data) related to that user that was accessed or stored pursuant to such consent. To comply with this policy, your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) will need to periodically reconfirm that its authorization tokens are still valid and delete [API Data](#definition-api-data) associated with users whose authorization tokens cannot be refreshed.
            
            Based on the requirements defined in section (III.E.4) regarding stored data, all such deletions should happen as soon as possible and must take place within 30 calendar days of that revocation.
            
3.  Usage and Quotas
    
    YouTube may use quotas and place use restrictions to ensure that [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) are accessed and used as intended and that you and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) do not reduce service quality or limit access for others.
    
    If your [API Client](#definition-api-client) reaches the quota limit for a service, you can apply for a quota extension by completing an [API Compliance Audit](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form) where you must specify the use case for which you need the extension. If you have been audited in the past 12 months and have been marked compliant by YouTube API Services team, you can apply for an [additional quota extension](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_audited_developer_requests_form).
    
    If YouTube approves the application, you must use the additional quota granted only for the approved use case. If your [API Client's](#definition-api-client) use case changes, to use any allocated quota for the new use case, you must notify YouTube of the change by resubmitting an [API Compliance Audit](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form) and receive approval for the application.
    
    If YouTube rejects the application, you can [file an appeal](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_appeals).
    
4.  Inactivity
    
    YouTube reserves the right to disable or curtail your access to, or use of, specific [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) if your [API Project](#definition-api-project) has been inactive for 90 consecutive days. For example, YouTube could revoke your [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials), or reduce (or eliminate) your [API Project's](#definition-api-project) quotas for specific [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services). If your [API Client's](#definition-api-client) quota is reduced or eliminated, you may reapply for quota or a quota extension, and YouTube will review that application based on YouTube's determination of your expected use of the [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services).
    
5.  Contact Information
    
    YouTube's primary means of contacting you about your [API Project](#definition-api-project) or [API Client](#definition-api-client) is the email address that is associated with the Google Account that you use to log in to the Google Developers Console. You must comply to any communication that YouTube sends you regarding compliance issues relating to your [API Clients](#definition-api-client).
    
    If users of your [API Client](#definition-api-client) have questions about your privacy practices, and you do not have a contact address in your [API Client's](#definition-api-client) privacy policy as discussed in section (A.2.i), YouTube may share your primary email address with those users.
    
6.  Prohibited Access
    
    You are prohibited from accessing or attempting to access [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) via any means if your [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) are suspended, revoked, or terminated, or if the Google Account you used to create those credentials is suspended or terminated, for any reason. In that case, you must not access or attempt to access [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) via any means, including by creating or using a proxy to create new Google Accounts, [API Credentials](#definition-api-credentials) or [API Projects](#definition-api-project).
    
7.  Undocumented Services
    
    You must not use undocumented APIs without express permission. You must access data from YouTube API services only according to the means stipulated in the authorized documentation of that YouTube API service.
    
    You must not reverse engineer undocumented YouTube API services or otherwise attempt to derive the underlying source code of these API services.
    

### E. Handling YouTube Data and Content

Aside from the permissions and rights granted in this section, you and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) have no further permissions or rights to [API Data](#definition-api-data), including to temporarily stored [API Data](#definition-api-data).

1.  Audiovisual Content
    
    You and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to:
    
    1.  download, import, backup, cache, or store copies of YouTube audiovisual content without YouTube's prior written approval,
    2.  make content available for offline playback, or
    3.  use any aspect of the [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) to facilitate or promote copyright infringement or the exploitation of copyright-infringing materials.
2.  Data Aggregation
    
    1.  Do not aggregate [API Data](#definition-api-data) except that you may only aggregate [API Data](#definition-api-data) relating to YouTube channels that are under the same content owner as recognized by YouTube pursuant to content licensing agreement(s) between YouTube and such content owner. Such aggregated [API Data](#definition-api-data) must only be viewable by that content owner.
        
    2.  Do not aggregate [API Data](#definition-api-data) or otherwise use [API Data](#definition-api-data) or [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) to gain insights into YouTube's usage, revenue, or any other aspects of YouTube's business.
        
        For example, suppose that two different content owners recognized by YouTube have each authorized an [API Client](#definition-api-client) to retrieve [API Data](#definition-api-data) on their behalf for their respective viewing. That [API Client](#definition-api-client) may separately aggregate [API Data](#definition-api-data) retrieved for each content owner's channels provided that such aggregation per content owner does not provide insights into YouTube's usage, revenue or any other aspects of YouTube's business. The [API Client](#definition-api-client) must not combine [API Data](#definition-api-data) from the different content owners.
        
3.  Authorized Data Usage
    
    These policies relate to your use of [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data). They are relevant for any [API Client](#definition-api-client) that writes data via an API request or retrieves data that can only be accessed via a properly authorized API request. For example, these policies apply to any [API Client](#definition-api-client) that enables a user to upload videos, retrieve the user's list of uploaded videos, create playlists, or comment on videos.
    
    1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must be honest and transparent about the types of user data and the purposes for which they collect, store, delete, share, safeguard, and otherwise use that data.
        
    2.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not display or allow access to [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data) to anyone other than the authorizing user or agents expressly approved by that user.
        
    3.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must only access, collect and use [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data) in accordance with the scope of its privacy policy and user consent obtained in accordance with Section 2.
        
        This means that an [API Client](#definition-api-client) must prompt users to re-accept its privacy policy if the [Client](#definition-api-client) starts to access, collect, or use [API Data](#definition-api-data) in a way or for purposes that were not covered in the privacy policy that the user originally accepted.
        
    4.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must clearly identify any actions that they take to insert, share, update, or delete data or content on the authorizing user's behalf. In addition, the user must expressly consent to those actions prior to their actual execution.
        
    5.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must clearly identify the YouTube channel or content owner that is associated with any request that requires user authorization.
        
    6.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must clearly identify any content visibility settings that will be set or modified by any authorized user action. In addition, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not modify existing content visibility settings unless the authorizing user has expressly instructed the [API Clients](#definition-api-client) to do so.
        
        For example, in the YouTube Data API service, a video's privacy status can be set to `public`, `private`, or `unlisted`. If an [API Client](#definition-api-client) supports video uploads, the [Client](#definition-api-client) must clearly display an option for the user to choose one of those values. Similarly, if an [API Client](#definition-api-client) supports edits to a video's metadata, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) cannot change a video's privacy status without the user's express consent.
        
4.  Refreshing, Storing, and Displaying API Data
    
    Developers often need to balance the benefits of storing or caching data, such as improved performance or resource usage, with the desire to always retrieve the freshest data, which provides the best user experience possible. With that in mind, the following policies explain your requirements as well as your options in terms of storing, updating, and displaying YouTube [API Data](#definition-api-data).
    
    1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) may store authorization tokens for as long as is necessary provided that those tokens are used only for purposes consistent with the specific consent granted by an active user according to the applicable law.
        
    2.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) may store the following types of [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data) for as long as is necessary provided that the data is used for purposes consistent with the specific consent granted by an active user according to the applicable laws:
        
        1.  data retrieved through the YouTube Analytics API service,
        2.  data provided through the YouTube Reporting API service, or
        3.  statistics provided through other YouTube API services, such as the number of views for a video, the number of channels for a subscriber, or the number of videos in a playlist. (All of those statistics can be retrieved via the YouTube Data API service.)
        
        Note that even though an [API Client](#definition-api-client) may store this data for more than 30 days, the [Client](#definition-api-client) must still ensure every 30 days that it is still authorized by the user to access that data.
        
        For example, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) may store view counts for a video for more than 30 days, but it must still verify every 30 days that its authorization to access the video uploader's data has not been revoked. The [API Client](#definition-api-client) must also verify, every 30 days, that the video has not been deleted.
        
        To be clear, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) must not store statistics retrieved as [Non-Authorized Data](#definition-non-authorized-data) for more than 30 days. For example, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) must not store the subscriber count for a YouTube channel for more than 30 days without authorization from the channel owner.
        
    3.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) may store all other types of [Authorized Data](#definition-authorized-data) not identified in section (III.E.4.b) for as long as is necessary for the purposes of the specific consent granted by an active user and for no longer than 30 calendar days. After 30 calendar days, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) must either delete or refresh the stored data.
        
    4.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) may temporarily store limited amounts of [Non-Authorized Data](#definition-non-authorized-data) for as long as is necessary for the purposes of the [API Client](#definition-api-client) but not longer than 30 calendar days. As in section (III.E.4.c) immediately above, this means that after 30 calendar days, the [API Client](#definition-api-client) must either delete or refresh the stored data.
        
    5.  In all cases, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must use reasonable efforts to ensure that their stored [API Data](#definition-api-data) is consistent with the current data available through [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services). For example, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) should reflect metadata changes and viewcount updates as quickly as possible.
        
    6.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must display the most updated [API Data](#definition-api-data) available in their user-facing presentations, including in user interfaces, although [API Clients](#definition-api-client) may display historical [API Data](#definition-api-data) provided that it is presented accurately in context of time.
        
    7.  Your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) that access or use user data must provide a way for a user to request that you delete stored data related to that user. For example, your [API Client](#definition-api-client) could display a button to delete stored data. If the user indicates that you should delete that data, you must then delete it as soon as possible and within 7 calendar days.
        
        The method for deleting stored data must make clear that deleting the data stored by the [API Client](#definition-api-client) does not, in any way, affect data stored by YouTube and that to delete data on YouTube, the user needs to use a YouTube Application or an authorized [API Client](#definition-api-client) that supports the ability to delete that data.
        
        Similarly, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must respect any other means by which a user expresses an intent to prevent those Clients from accessing user data related to that user. For example, if a user deletes his account from your API Client, you must also delete any user data you have stored related to that user as soon as possible and within 7 calendar days.
        
    8.  Your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not (i) replace [API Data](#definition-api-data) with similar, independently calculated data, or (ii) access or use [API Data](#definition-api-data) to create new or derived data or metrics.  To the extent your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) display any information, data or metrics not based on [API Data](#definition-api-data) alongside [API Data](#definition-api-data), your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must include a clear and prominent disclosure there that such information, data and metrics are not from YouTube and are part of your own product.
        
        For example, when displaying the number of likes for a video, your [API Client](#definition-api-client) must use the number returned in the [API Data](#definition-api-data). You must not substitute a different number to represent likes, such as the number of users of your [API Client](#definition-api-client) that liked the video. Similarly, you are not permitted to use the number of likes returned in the [API Data](#definition-api-data) to calculate other metrics, such as the percentage of total likes that were made through your [API Client](#definition-api-client) or a score that factors in likes, total views, or any other [API Data](#definition-api-data). However, you are permitted, for example, to display the number of likes that were made through your [API Client](#definition-api-client) as long as that number is displayed alongside the total likes returned in the [API Data](#definition-api-data) and as long as your [API Client](#definition-api-client) clearly communicates that the [API Client](#definition-api-client) calculates the additional metric independently of YouTube [API Data](#definition-api-data).
        
    9.  When your [API Client](#definition-api-client) loads, it collects and shares some basic user data with YouTube via the YouTube embedded player to render the video thumbnail and title, determine playability and content restrictions, and for fraud and abuse reasons. Additional data is collected and shared by your [API Client](#definition-api-client) upon video playback to customize the player on your [API Client](#definition-api-client) and third party sites and apps. Remember that if you enable Autoplay, playback will occur without any user interaction with the player; playback data collection and sharing will therefore occur upon page load. You can limit the data shared with YouTube before a user interacts with the YouTube embedded player by setting Autoplay to `false`. As noted in the [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service), you and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations.
        
    10.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must look up the Made For Kids status of each YouTube video that it embeds on its site or app by following the instructions in [this guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/made_for_kids_status). For each video that is designated Made For Kids, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must turn off tracking and make sure that all data collection with respect to that player is compliant with applicable law(s) including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy (COPPA) and E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)). See the [YouTube Help Center](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076) for more information on determining content as Made for Kids.
         
5.  Security
    
    You and your [API Client](#definition-api-client) must:
    
    1.  maintain appropriate administrative, organisational, technical, and physical controls to ensure the privacy, security, and confidentiality of user data and [API Data](#definition-api-data);
    2.  use only industry-standard transport encryption;
    3.  protect [API Data](#definition-api-data) and any other data used in your [API Client](#definition-api-client) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
6.  Scraping
    
    You and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to, directly or indirectly, scrape [YouTube Applications](#definition-youtube-applications) or [Google Applications](#definition-google-applications), or obtain scraped YouTube data or content. Public search engines may scrape data only in accordance with YouTube's robots.txt file or with YouTube's prior written permission.
    

### F. User Experience

1.  YouTube Look and Feel
    
    Innovative user experiences and user interface designs are among the most valuable contributions that [API Clients](#definition-api-client) can provide to the YouTube community. That said, YouTube's designers and engineers put a lot of thought into designing [YouTube Applications](#definition-youtube-applications) to ensure that those Applications provide a great user experience.
    
    Taking both of those points into account, your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not change or interfere with user interfaces in [YouTube Applications](#definition-youtube-applications) unless you have obtained YouTube's prior written approval. You can request that approval at [this form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form).
    
2.  Branding
    
    1.  Any [API Client](#definition-api-client) page or feature that displays YouTube content – including, without limitation, search results, YouTube videos, channels, playlists, thumbnails, and YouTube players – must make clear to the viewer that YouTube is the source of the relevant content by displaying [YouTube Brand Features](#definition-youtube-brand-features) in accordance with the requirements below and the YouTube Branding Guidelines ([https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines)).
        
        In some cases, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) might need to display [YouTube Brand Features](#definition-youtube-brand-features) next to multiple individual content elements to make the attribution clear to the viewer. For example, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) that displays search results from YouTube and from other sources on the same page needs to clearly identify YouTube as the source of only the search results from YouTube, including text, images, and other information pertaining to YouTube search results. The [API Client](#definition-api-client) cannot provide one general set of attribution for all search results from various sources.
        
    2.  Content that does not originate from YouTube must not be shown in a way that suggests that the content is originating from YouTube or in a way that can cause confusion as to the origin of that content.
        
    3.  You and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not, and must not encourage, enable or require others to, directly or indirectly, interfere with or obscure any attribution provided by YouTube, including attribution provided via or shown in embedded YouTube players. Your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must display applicable [YouTube Brand Features](#definition-youtube-brand-features) and any other YouTube-provided attribution on all types of devices.
        
3.  Playback Integrity
    
    Playback integrity refers to the ability to determine and measure how content and ads are served, how video playback is initiated and implemented, and how users interact with YouTube features in your [API Client](#definition-api-client). Playback integrity is critical to the YouTube platform, as it helps protect creators' interests, including their ability to monetize their content and develop their audience.
    
    YouTube believes that playback integrity is contingent on a user choosing to watch a video, and [API Clients](#definition-api-client) are prohibited from providing incentives for watching videos as follows:
    
    1.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not charge users to watch content in an embedded YouTube player.
        
    2.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not otherwise gate access to a video by requiring a user to take an action other than clicking the play button to view or continue playing YouTube audiovisual content. For example, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not require a user to subscribe to a channel or like a video to continue watching YouTube audiovisual content.
        
        For clarity, if your [API Client's](#definition-api-client) normal functionality requires a certain action that is not specific to [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services), such as login or age verification, that functionality is allowed.
        
    3.  [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not offer or provide incentives, rewards, or other compensation to users for engaging with [YouTube Applications](#definition-youtube-applications) (directly or indirectly) by performing actions like viewing content, liking content, sharing content, subscribing to channels, adding comments. For example, [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not offer features or services that trade video views for a fee or that trade video views in return for other YouTube-related or non-YouTube-related actions.
        

### G. Distribution and Commercial Use

You may distribute or sell [API Clients](#definition-api-client) subject to the restrictions defined in the "Prohibited Actions" subsection below and, of course, to the other terms of the [Agreement](#definition-agreement).

In addition, you may distribute and display YouTube audiovisual content and accompanying metadata to users through your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) as long as those Clients comply with the [Agreement](#definition-agreement) and, specifically, do not engage in any of the prohibited actions listed immediately below.

1.  Prohibited Actions
    
    For specific policies in the following list that require YouTube's prior written approval, you can request that approval at [this form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form).
    
    You and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to:

    3.  Developing ad-enabled [API Clients](#definition-api-client), such as an ad-enabled blog or website, that use [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) subject to compliance with all other terms of the Agreement, including the restrictions in section III.G.1.d;
        
    4.  Placing your own branding in an [API Client](#definition-api-client) as long as that branding complies with the [YouTube Branding Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines) and does not interfere with YouTube audiovisual content playback or any [YouTube Brand Features](#definition-youtube-brand-features);
        
    5.  Selling or distributing devices that contain or run an API Client;
        

### H. Monitoring and Audits

YouTube reserves the right to survey, monitor, and/or audit your access to or use of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) to ensure quality, to improve YouTube products and services, and to verify your compliance with the [Agreement](#definition-agreement). To that end, YouTube may survey users of your [API Clients](#definition-api-client).

You and those acting on your behalf must:

1.  not interfere with such surveys, monitoring efforts, or audits;
2.  not obscure or conceal from YouTube your access to or use of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services); and
3.  upon request, and within the timeframe stated in that request, provide YouTube with account(s) necessary to access all features or functions of the current, in-production version(s) of your [API Clients](#definition-api-client), so that YouTube may review those [API Clients](#definition-api-client) for compliance with the [Agreement](#definition-agreement).

YouTube may use any technical means to overcome non-compliance with these provisions.

### I. Additional Prohibitions

The policies in this section identify additional things that [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not do. Actions contrary to these policies would be harmful to YouTube, to the YouTube community as a whole, or to individuals or groups of individuals within that community. These policies focus on the need for you and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) to treat members of the YouTube community honestly and respectfully as well as on your need to respect the integrity of YouTube's services, content, and interests.

You and your [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to:

1.  use [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) to create, offer, or act as a substitute for, or substantially similar service to, any [YouTube Applications](#definition-youtube-applications). [API Clients](#definition-api-client) must not mimic or replicate YouTube's core user experiences by recreating features or process flows unless they add significant independent value or functionality that improves users' interactions with YouTube. For example, an [API Client](#definition-api-client) must not recreate the browse experience from any YouTube Application without adding significant independent value to that flow.
    
2.  misuse [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services) or engage in abusive behaviors related to those Services. For example, you must not automate or trigger views, uploads, comments, likes, dislikes, or other actions without the user's prior specific and express consent;
    
3.  interfere, or attempt to interfere, in any way with the proper workings of any aspect of [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services), [YouTube Applications](#definition-youtube-applications), or [Google Applications](#definition-google-applications), including interference or disruption of the servers or networks that provide those Services or Applications;
    
4.  modify, interfere with, replace, or otherwise disable any functionality, data, or content made available as part of, or in connection with, [YouTube API Services](#definition-youtube-api-services).

### J. Child-Directed API Clients

1.  If your API Client (or any part thereof) targets or directs itself to children (as defined under applicable law(s) including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy (COPPA) and E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) (referred to herein as a "**Child-Directed API Client**"), you and your Child-Directed API Client must:
    
    1.  ensure that your Child-Directed API Client, including its access to and use of any YouTube API Services, is compliant with COPPA, GDPR, and any other applicable laws or regulations at all times;
        
    2.  notify Google of the child directed nature of your Child-Directed API Client using the tools provided in [here](https://support.google.com/policies/answer/9664901). Each Child-Directed API Client notified to Google using such tools or otherwise is referred to herein as a "**Known Child-Directed API Client**"; and
        
    3.  not use personalized ads (including remarketing) to target past or current activity by any user of your Child-Directed API Client.
        
2.  1.  **For You and Your Child-Directed API Client.** You and your Child-Directed API Client will not, and must not attempt to, take any YouTube API Services write-based actions to YouTube websites, applications, services or products via your Child-Directed API Client.
        
    2.  Notwithstanding Section III.D.1.c (API Credentials) above which requires exactly one (1) [API Project](#definition-api-project) for each [API Client](#definition-api-client), you can upload your own videos to your own official YouTube channel(s) via the YouTube Data API Service (not via your Child-Directed API Client or anyone else's API Client) by creating a new API Project ("**Upload Project**").
        
        1.  To upload your own videos to your own official YouTube channel(s) via YouTube Data API Service, you must (A) create one (1) new [API Project](#definition-api-project) using the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) ([https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/)) (an "**Upload Project**") prior to uploading, (B) append _mfk110_ as a prefix in the ID of your Upload Project, and (C) only upload from your non-Child-Directed API Client (not from your Child-Directed API Client or anyone else's API Client); and
            
        2.  Only you can use the Upload Project, and the Upload Project must only be used to upload your own videos to your own official YouTube channel(s) via the YouTube Data API Service from your non-Child-Directed API Client (not from your Child-Directed API Client or anyone else's API Client). If you are uploading a Made for Kids video via the YouTube Data API Service from your non-Child-Directed API Client (not from your Child-Directed API Client or anyone else's API Client), you must designate the YouTube Data API Service Made for Kids parameter as "true". See here for more information on determining if content is [Made for Kids](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076).
            
    3.  **For You and Users of Your Child-Directed API Client.** You and your Child-Directed API Client must not enable, encourage or require, users of your Child-Directed API Client to take YouTube API Services write-based actions (such as, but not limited to, uploading content, commenting and creating/sharing playlists). YouTube API Services write-based actions taken by users of Known Child-Directed API Clients will not be implemented on YouTube websites, applications, services and products. This means that, notwithstanding [Section 9.1 (Required Notice) of the YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) pursuant to which users of your API Client may upload content to their YouTube channels or your YouTube channel(s), uploads from users of Known Child-Directed API Clients will not be implemented on YouTube websites, applications, services and products.
        
3.  You and your API Client's access to, or use of, YouTube API Services can be suspended or terminated by YouTube for non-compliance with the YouTube API Services Terms of Service and Policies including non-compliance with this Section III.J.
    

### K. Reporting Noncompliance

=====================================================

![Spark icon](/_static/images/icons/spark.svg)

AI-generated Key Takeaways
--------------------------

outlined\_flag

*   This document outlines the minimum functional requirements for API clients accessing YouTube API services, ensuring a consistent user experience for users, content owners, and advertisers.
    
*   API clients using embedded YouTube players must adhere to specific size constraints, automatic playback rules, and restrictions on overlays or modifications to the player's appearance.
    
*   When allowing video uploads, API clients must enable users to define specific properties, such as the video's title, description, and privacy settings.
    
*   API clients must provide full or truncated comment text, display channel or video titles depending on the content of the comment and be able to identify when comments are held for moderation.
    
*   API clients must clearly identify the YouTube account associated with any comment or action such as adding a ban to a user.
    

**Note:** [Complying with the YouTube Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide) provides guidance and examples to help you ensure that your API clients follow specific portions of the YouTube API Services [Terms](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) and [Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) (API TOS). The guide offers insight into how YouTube enforces certain aspects of the API TOS, but it does not replace any existing documents.

This document defines minimum functional requirements for API clients that implement or provide access to specific features of YouTube API services ("API Clients").

These requirements and guidelines ensure that API clients provide a consistent user experience that protects the interests of YouTube users, content owners, and advertisers. These rules are an integral part of the [YouTube API Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms) and must be followed in the development and implementation of any API Clients.

You should expect the requirements in this document to change so that we can ensure better user experiences with existing YouTube features. They will also change in response to new and updated YouTube features. At times, such changes may require you to update your API Clients to address new requirements. The [Terms of Service revision history](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/revision-history) will document any changes, so please check that document frequently, or subscribe to its [RSS feed](https://developers.google.com/static/youtube/terms/feeds/api-services-terms-of-service-revision-history.xml), to ensure that you can quickly learn about changes that may affect your API Clients.

In addition to the requirements in this document, we highly recommend that you follow best practices described in the [YouTube API Services Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) and discussed elsewhere in YouTube API services' documentation. Even when not strictly required, these practices help your API Clients to recover more quickly from errors and to optimize their quota usage if they use YouTube API services that allocate quota. At the same time, these practices help to ensure the health of the YouTube ecosystem and, above all, to provide the best experience possible to users of your API Clients and of YouTube Applications.

YouTube embedded player and video playback
------------------------------------------

The requirements in this section relate specifically to embedded YouTube players. The [YouTube API Services Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) also includes several policies relevant to API Clients that play YouTube audiovisual content.

### API Client Identity and Credentials

API Clients that use the YouTube embedded player (including the YouTube IFrame Player API) must provide identification through the `HTTP Referer` request header. In some environments, the browser will automatically set `HTTP Referer`, and API Clients need only ensure they are not setting the [`Referrer-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Referrer-Policy) in a way that suppresses the `Referer` value. YouTube recommends using `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` Referrer-Policy, which is already the default in many browsers.

Similarly, if integrating the YouTube embedded player in a window created by using JavaScript `window.open`, API Clients must not use the [`noreferrer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#noreferrer) feature, which suppresses the `Referer` value.

#### Set the Referer

In environments where `HTTP Referer` is empty by default and not automatically set by the browser, API Clients must take action to provide their identity through alternative means. In WebView integrations such as a mobile app or desktop app, `HTTP Referer` is empty by default and the `Referer` is typically set using one of these techniques:

*   **Mobile app with player inside a local HTML file**
    
    In this configuration, the player is loaded in an HTML file that is bundled with the app. When loading this HTML file, setting the `baseUrl` parameter will set the `Referer`.
    
    *   Android [`loadDataWithBaseURL`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView#loadDataWithBaseURL\(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String\))
    *   iOS [`loadHTMLString:baseURL:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/1415004-loadhtmlstring?language=objc)
*   **Mobile app without local HTML file**
    
    In this configuration, the player is loaded directly from `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID` without any enclosing HTML file. You set the `Referer` by adding it as an HTTP Header:
    
    *   Android [`loadUrl`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView#loadUrl\(java.lang.String,%20java.util.Map%3Cjava.lang.String,java.lang.String%3E\)) with the `Referer` HTTP Header added to the `additionalHttpHeaders` parameter
    *   iOS [`loadRequest:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/load\(_:\)?language=objc) with the `Referer` HTTP Header added to the request. For example:
        
        NSString \*bundleId = \[\[NSBundle mainBundle\] bundleIdentifier\];
        NSString \*referrer = \[\[NSString stringWithFormat:@"https://%@", bundleId\] lowercaseString\];
        NSURL \*referrerUrl = \[NSURL URLWithString:referrer\];
        
        NSString \*destination = @"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO\_ID";
        NSURL \*destinationUrl = \[NSURL URLWithString:destination\];
        
        NSMutableURLRequest \*request = \[NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:destinationUrl\];
        \[request addValue:referrerUrl forHTTPHeaderField:@"Referer"\];
        
        // Create an instance of WKWebView (omitted for simplicity), then load the NSMutableURLRequest.
        \[webView loadRequest:request\];
        
*   **Mobile app with player inside a native browser tab**
    
    *   Android `CustomTabs`
        
        Use [`Intent.EXTRA_REFERRER`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/Intent#EXTRA_REFERRER_NAME:kotlin.String) to set the referrer. Be sure to use the `android-app://` scheme instead of `https://` when creating the `Uri`. For example:
        
        String destinationUrl = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO\_ID";
        CustomTabsIntent customTabsIntent = new CustomTabsIntent.Builder().build()
        customTabsIntent.intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA\_REFERRER, Uri.parse("android-app://" + context.getPackageName()));
        customTabsIntent.launchUrl(this, Uri.parse(destinationUrl));
        
    *   iOS `SFSafariViewController`
        
        `SFSafariViewController` does not support setting the `Referer`. In this case, set the [`origin`](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#origin) player parameter instead.
        
*   **Desktop app**
    
    In this configuration, set the `Referer` by adding it as an HTTP Header:
    
    *   Microsoft .NET - use [`HttpRequestHeaders.Referrer`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.headers.httprequestheaders.referrer?view=net-9.0) or [`CoreWebView2HttpRequestHeaders.SetHeader`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2httprequestheaders.setheader?view=webview2-dotnet-1.0.3296.44#microsoft-web-webview2-core-corewebview2httprequestheaders-setheader\(system-string-system-string\))
    *   macOS - follow the same instructions described above for iOS mobile apps

For other platforms where `HTTP Referer` is empty by default, set the `Referer` value by configuring the WebView in which the player is loaded. The exact technique might vary by platform.

If you are the owner of a library, framework, plugin, service, or wrapper used by developers to integrate the YouTube embedded player, you must retrieve the app ID from the environment (this may not be possible, depending on the platform) or allow developers to pass-in their app ID so that `Referer` (and the [`widget_referrer`](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#widget_referrer) player parameter, if appropriate) can be set as described above.

#### Referer format

When you explicitly provide Referer by setting a WebView parameter or adding an HTTP Header, the format is typically a fully qualified URL. Specify `HTTPS` as the protocol. Within the URL, the domain name must be your application identifier ("app ID") that is registered with the store that distributed your app to end users. If your app is provided to users through an alternative distribution channel, use the app ID that is registered with the operating system during app install. In most cases, your app ID will be a reversed domain name (also known as "reverse-DNS format"), like `com.google.android.youtube`. Representative examples:

*   Android OS and Android apps on ChromeOS: [App ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-app-module#set_the_application_id)
*   Apple platforms, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS: [Bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleidentifier)
*   Samsung Tizen: [App ID](https://docs.tizen.org/application/native/#package-id-and-application-id)
*   Linux distributions:
    *   Fedora: [App ID](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/flatpak/concepts/#application_id)
    *   Gnome: [App ID](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/application-id.html)
    *   Ubuntu: [App ID](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppStore/Interfaces/ApplicationId)

On some platforms the app ID is not a reversed domain name. In these cases, use the unique app ID assigned by the store that distributes the app. When the store app ID is a generated alphanumeric string (assigned by the store or development tools, not chosen by the app developer), include both the app display name (replacing spaces with hyphens) and the store app ID, delimited by a period. For example: `<my-app-name>.<AppID>`. This value should be stable across app version changes. If the app is not hosted on a store, use the app ID that is registered with the operating system during app install; this is typically a unique identifier in the app manifest. Exclude any details about app version and supported architecture. Representative examples:

*   **Chrome Web Store: store-hosted**
    
    The store app ID is typically the last part of the path in the app url `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/<hyphenated-app-name>/<AppID>`. Use the hyphenated app name and the store app ID to build the `<my-app-name>.<AppID>` string described above.
    
*   **Windows: store-hosted**
    
    The store app ID is typically the last part of the path in the app url `https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/<AppID>`. Use the store app ID to build the `<my-app-name>.<AppID>` string described above. The hyphenated app name must be included as well.
    
*   **Windows: non-store distribution**
    
    Windows apps contain a [package identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/package-identity-overview) in the app manifest: `Name_Version_Architecture_ResourceID_PublisherID`. Use only the `Name` attribute.
    
*   **Xbox: store-hosted**
    
    The store app ID is typically the last part of the path in the app url `https://www.xbox.com/<region>/games/store/<hyphenated-app-name>/<AppID>`. Use the hyphenated app name and the store app ID to build the `<my-app-name>.<AppID>` string described above.
    

For API Clients with a high number of requests to YouTube (see [Usage and Quotas](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#usage-and-quotas)), additional credentials might be required to access the YouTube embedded player.

Failure to comply with these requirements might result in reduced functionality in the YouTube embedded player.

### WebView Type

When integrating the YouTube embedded player in a WebView, use one of the OS-provided WebView types when available. For example:

*   Android OS: [`WebView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView) or [`CustomTabs`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/browser/customtabs/package-summary)
*   Apple platforms, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS: [`WKWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) or [`SFSafariViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller)

### Embedded YouTube Player size

Embedded players must have a viewport that is at least 200px by 200px. If the player displays controls, it must be large enough to fully display the controls without shrinking the viewport below the minimum size. We recommend 16:9 players be at least 480 pixels wide and 270 pixels tall.

### Autoplay and scripted playbacks

This section covers automatic playbacks. It applies to YouTube embedded players that either use the `[autoplay](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#autoplay)` player parameter or programmatically initiate automatic playback using the YouTube IFrame Player API service or another YouTube API service.

*   Embedded players that automatically play a video should initiate playback immediately when the page loads or as soon as the embedded player is fully visible. However, an API Client must not initiate an automatic playback until the player is visible and more than half of the player is visible on the page or screen.
    
*   A page or screen must not have more than one YouTube player that automatically plays content simultaneously.
    
*   Any YouTube thumbnail that initiates a playback must be at least 120 pixels wide and 70 pixels tall.
    

### YouTube Player attributes

Attributes and parameters of the YouTube player – including, for example, the appearance of YouTube branding in the player – are specified in YouTube API documentation and specifications (https://developers.google.com/youtube). You must not make changes to the YouTube player that are not explicitly described by the API documentation.

### Overlays and frames

You must not display overlays, frames, or other visual elements in front of any part of a YouTube embedded player, including player controls. Similarly, you must not use overlays, frames or other visual elements to obscure any part of an embedded player, including player controls.

### Mouseovers

You must not use mouseovers or touch events on a YouTube player to initiate any action on the user's behalf, such as opening a window or subscribing to a channel.

Uploading videos
----------------

If API Clients allow users to upload content to multiple platforms, users should be able to select and deselect the platforms to which they want to upload their videos.

### Data requirements

API clients that enable users to upload videos to YouTube must enable _users_ to set the values in the following list. Any properties that are not listed are optional.

|     | Name | Description |

YouTube API Services - Subject API Services
===========================================

**Note:** [Complying with the YouTube Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide) provides guidance and examples to help you ensure that your API clients follow specific portions of the YouTube API Services [Terms](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) and [Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) (API TOS). The guide offers insight into how YouTube enforces certain aspects of the API TOS, but it does not replace any existing documents.

The [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) (the "Terms") state (in Section 14) that when YouTube intends to make backward-incompatible changes to YouTube API services, YouTube will announce those changes and try to continue to maintain the software code for six months after the announcement.

This page identifies the **Subject API Services** referenced in section 14.3 (Special Terms) of the Terms and explains how that section of the Terms affects actual deprecation dates. Prior to February 10, 2017, which is the effective date of the current Terms, the Subject API Services had been subject to a one-year deprecation policy under the previous set of Terms. To honor that policy, the Subject API Services are, temporarily, subject to different deprecation rules than other services.

Understanding deprecation dates
-------------------------------

In the event of backward-incompatible changes to Subject API Services, YouTube will use reasonable efforts to maintain code until at least February 10, 2018, which is one year after these Terms became effective. For other services, YouTube will try to continue to maintain the software code for six months from the date those changes are announced.

### Exemptions

Some features of Subject API Services are not subject to the rules defined in Section 14.3 of the Terms because those features were also not subject to the deprecation policy defined under the prior set of Terms. Those features are identified as **exemptions** in the list of subject services below.

When an exemption applies to an `object` property, it also applies to any of that property's child properties. In addition, the exemption applies to the ability to retrieve, set, modify, or delete values of the property or its child properties as well as to the property values themselves.

Subject API Services
--------------------

The following sections define the Subject API Services. For completeness, these sections also identify fully deprecated API services. Those fully deprecated services are not covered under the Terms.

Note that, in all cases, the legal documents themselves are the authoritative source of information.

### July 7, 2025

Added [API Client Identity and Credentials](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/required-minimum-functionality#embedded-player-api-client-identity) to the YouTube embedded player section of [Required Minimum Functionality](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/required-minimum-functionality). This new content clarifies API Client identification requirements and guidelines when using the embedded player. Similar guidelines within [Complying with YouTube's Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide) were also consolidated.

### January 23, 2025

References to the "Android Player API" have been removed from the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) and the [Required Minimum Functionality](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/required-minimum-functionality). The Android Player API was deprecated in 2023 and is no longer available.

### July 12, 2022

Section 4 of the [YouTube API Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) has been updated to clarify when and why registration data may be retained.

### June 2, 2022

Added [Section III.I.21](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#III-I-21) to the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies). The updated policy explains usage of the YouTube player in nested iframe scenarios. Specifically, the YouTube player must not be situated in a nested or hierarchical iframe lineage to circumvent YouTube policies or otherwise obfuscate the source of use.

### July 1, 2021

All developers using YouTube's API Services must complete an API Compliance Audit in order to be granted more than the default quota allocation of 10,000 units. To date, both the compliance audit process and requests for additional quota unit allocations have been conducted by developers filling out and submitting the [YouTube API Services - Audit and Quota Extension Form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form).

To clarify these processes and better meet the needs of developers using our API Services, we are adding three new forms and a guide to completing those forms:

*   [Audited Developer Requests Form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_audited_developer_requests_form): Developers who have already passed an API Compliance Audit can fill out and submit this shorter form to request an allocated quota extension.
*   [Appeals Form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_appeals): Developers whose API projects have failed a compliance audit (or been denied a quota unit increase) can fill out and submit this form.
*   [Change of Control Form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_change_of_control_form): Developers, or any party operating an API client on a developer's behalf, who experience a change of control (for example, through a stock purchase or sale, merger or other form of corporate transaction) associated with an API project must fill out and submit this form. This enables YouTube's API team to update our records, audit the new API project's use case compliance, and validate the developer's current quota allocation.

Each new form will inform us of your intended usage of YouTube's API and enable us to better assist you.

More details are available in our new API Compliance Audits [guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/quota_and_compliance_audits).

### October 15, 2020

Two new sections have been added to the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies):

*   The new [Section III.E.4.i](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#III-E-4-i) provides additional information about the data collected and sent via the YouTube embedded player. You are responsible for any user data you send to us via any YouTube embedded player before the user has interacted with the player to indicate playback intent. You can limit the data shared with YouTube before a user interacts with the player by setting Autoplay to false.
*   The new [Section III.E.4.j](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#III-E-4-j) relates to checking the Made for Kids (MFK) status of content before embedding it on your sites and apps. You are responsible for knowing when videos that you embed on your API Client are made for kids and treating data collected from the embedded player accordingly. As such, you must check the status of content using YouTube Data API Service before embedding it on your API Client via any YouTube embedded players.

The new [Finding the MadeForKids status of a video](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/made_for_kids_status) guide explains how to look up the MFK status of a video using the [YouTube Data API Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).

In conjunction with these changes, a reminder has been added to the [Embedded Player Parameter documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters) to explain that if you enable Autoplay, playback will occur without any user interaction with the player; playback data collection and sharing will therefore occur upon page load.

### August 27, 2020

The [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) and the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) link, in several places, to a form that you would use to apply for a quota extension, to request YouTube's approval for a user interface change or other modification, or to notify YouTube of a change of control for your API client. Previously, some of these links pointed to different forms specific to a particular type of request, but they have been updated to all point to the same [form](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form). For the use cases listed here, please select 'Quota Extension Request' in the form and include any relevant data in the 'Explain in detail how you use YouTube API Services today' input box.

### June 30, 2020

The [Complying with the YouTube Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide) guide begins with a list of policies that developers using YouTube API services must adhere to. The **Terms of Service** link in that list has been corrected to point to the [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) rather than the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms).

### June 15, 2020

The new [Complying with the YouTube Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide) guide provides guidance and examples to help you ensure that your API clients adhere to specific portions of the YouTube API Services [Terms](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) and [Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) (API TOS).

This guidance offers insight into how YouTube enforces certain aspects of the API TOS but does not replace any existing documents. The guide addresses some of the most common questions that developers ask during API compliance audits. We hope that it simplifies your feature development process by helping you understand how we interpret and enforce our policies.

### January 10, 2020

Section 9.1 of the [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service#notices-to-users) has been updated to include new requirements for Child-Directed API Clients and non-Child-Directed API Clients as well as requirements relating to uploading content to YouTube from Child-Directed API Clients and non-Child-Directed API Clients.

Section III.J (Reporting Noncompliance) of the Developer Policies has been (i) renumbered to Section III.K (Reporting Noncompliance) and (ii) replaced in its entirety with a [new Section III.J (Child-Directed API Clients)](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#j.-child-directed-api-clients). The new Section III.J (Child-Directed API Clients) sets forth requirements for Child-Directed API Clients including specific compliance with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA), E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and any other applicable laws or regulations, and notifying Google of your Child-Directed API Clients. In addition, Child-Directed API Clients and users of Child-Directed API Clients must not take any YouTube API Services write-based actions to YouTube websites, applications, services or products via Child-Directed API Clients. Access to, or use of, YouTube API Services can be suspended or terminated for non-compliance with the YouTube API Services Terms of Service and Developer Policies including non-compliance with Section III.J.

### June 18, 2019

The link to the form that you would use to apply for a quota extension, which appears in section D.3 of the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies), has been updated.

### December 18, 2017

Section III.E.4.h of the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) has been updated to clarify that in addition to not replacing API Data with independently calculated data, you also must not access or use API Data to create new or derived data or metrics. In addition, the updated policy explains a requirement on API Clients to clearly disclose that any information, data, or metrics that are not based on API Data but that display alongside API Data are not from YouTube and are part of your own product.

### February 10, 2017

The updated YouTube API Services Terms of Service and related documents such as the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies), which were originally published on August 11, 2016, now collectively constitute the effective set of Terms for YouTube API Services. The current set of Terms was originally published 180 days before it would become effective to ensure developers had sufficient time to review and comply with the updated set of Terms.

The Terms and related documents, such as the [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies), have been updated so that they no longer mention old and new sets of Terms. To avoid confusion, the prior set of Terms has also been removed.

### January 27, 2017

The following changes have been made to the [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) and [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) that are scheduled to go into effect on February 10, 2017.

*   Section 23 of the YouTube API Services Terms of Service has been updated. The changes limit the length of time and circumstances when the non-assert provision in the Terms is applicable.
    
*   The following forms linked from the Terms and Developer Policies are now active:
    
    | Document | Section | Form |
    | --- | --- | --- |

### August 11, 2016

The newly published [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) (the "Updated Terms") provides a rich set of updates to the current Terms of Service. In addition to the Updated Terms, which will go into effect as of February 10, 2017, this update includes several supporting documents that explain YouTube policies to help guide developers who are integrating YouTube API Services into their API Clients.

This update includes the following documents. All documents are in English unless otherwise noted.

*   The Updated Terms. Versions are available for the following regions and countries:
    
    *   [Americas](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service)
    *   [APAC](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service-apac)
    *   [EMEA](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service-emea) - translations are also published in [Dutch](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service-emea-nl), [French](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service-emea-fr), [German](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service-emea-de), and [Spanish](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service-emea-es)
    *   [Russia](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service-ru) (Russian)
*   The [Developer Policies](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies) explain policies that you need to follow when accessing or using YouTube API Services in your service, product, or application.
    
*   The [Required Minimum Functionality](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/required-minimum-functionality) defines minimum functional requirements for API Clients that implement or provide access to specific features of YouTube API Services. For example, API Clients that enable video uploads to YouTube must enable users to set a title when uploading a video.
    
*   The [Subject API Services](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/subject-api-services) document identifies the **Subject API Services** discussed in section 14.3 (Special Terms) of the Updated Terms. The new document also explains how that section of the Updated Terms would affect actual deprecation dates for Subject API Services.
    
*   The [Branding Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/branding-guidelines) are not a new document, but they will apply under the Updated Terms just as they apply under the current Terms.

The following changes were made to a previous version of the Terms of Service.

In addition to these changes, there are a couple of other changes related to the current Terms of Service:

*   Section 7 (Deprecation) has said for a long time that, following a deprecation announcement, Google would use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain YouTube API versions and features identified at [https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube-api-list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube-api-list) until the later of (i) one year after the announcement or (ii) April 20, 2015. The text has been updated to remove the reference to the April 2015 date since any deprecation announcements yet to occur are certain to be after that date.
    
*   We have removed the set of **Monetization Guidelines** that talked about guidelines for building commercial applications. Those guidelines, which were originally written in 2008, contained references to features that were deprecated years ago as well as to sample implementations that were no longer relevant. The link from the Terms of Service to those guidelines has also been removed.
