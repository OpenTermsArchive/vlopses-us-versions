Using the YouTube Logo check
----------------------------

Before using our logo, make sure you’ve downloaded the latest version, and be mindful of our usage guidelines. Below you’ll find downloadable versions of the logo:

Core logo
---------

The full-color logos pair our YouTube Red icon with Almost Black (#212121) or White (#FFFFFF) text. The triangle in the full-color red icon must always be white.

The Almost Black full-color logo can be shown on a White background or light imagery.

**NEW** the hex value of the red in the YouTube icon was recently updated to #ff0033 please ensure to download the latest logo files above

Monochromatic Logos
-------------------

If it's difficult to see the full-color logo over a specific color or image you can use a monochrome logo instead.

In monochrome logos the icon is the same color as the wordmark (either Almost Black or White). The triangle in the icon is knocked out so the background shows through when using a monochrome logo.

Clear Space
-----------

Clear space buffers the logo from images, text, or other graphics that compromise its impact and visibility. The more breathing room you give our logo, the greater the impact it can have.

The clear space around the logo must be equal to or greater than the size of the triangle in the icon.

Naming and Third Party Content
------------------------------

Using the word “YouTuber”
-------------------------

Guidelines for creators
-----------------------

*   We love that so many creators like to call themselves YouTubers. We just ask that “YouTuber” or “Tuber” is only used when talking about a person creating and uploading original video or music content to YouTube.
*   We also want to keep "YouTuber" casual. That way everyone can use it. So please don’t use “YouTuber” or “Tuber” in official names of things like video series, books, and programs, or register domains, channel names, or trademarks that include those words. This’ll help us protect the YouTube trademark for the whole creator community.

Guidelines for advertisers
--------------------------

*   While “Tuber” can be used by YouTube creators informally, it should never be used by advertisers.

Third party approvals
---------------------

*   You’re responsible for getting third-party approvals from relevant content owners for any content you upload to YouTube that doesn't belong to you.
*   You must have appropriate third-party approval from relevant content owners if you show any content in promotional material.
*   YouTube doesn't negotiate permissions on behalf of our partners. You must contact the image or video owner directly to secure appropriate permissions.
*   By uploading to YouTube, you guarantee that you have the necessary rights to upload your video. YouTube reserves the right to remove any content from the site that may violate its Terms of Use or Community Guidelines.
