Other legal complaints
======================

YouTube only considers legal complaints when the party in question or their authorized legal representative contacts us.

If someone posts your personal identifiable info or uploads a video of you without your knowledge, including in private or sensitive circumstances, [ask the uploader to remove the content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57955). If the uploader doesn’t agree, or if you're uncomfortable contacting them, file a complaint through the [process](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/142443) on YouTube’s [Privacy Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399) page. Personal info can include your image, name, national identification number, bank account number, contact info, or other uniquely identifiable info. Learn more about the criteria for [content removal due to a privacy violation](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399#removal_criteria).

If your complaint is not about privacy, select your country/region of dispute from the menu and follow the directions.

#### If you can't find your country/region in the menu above

YouTube.com is governed by U.S. law. As such, we do not accept legal complaints from the country/region of your claimed rights. We recommend that you pursue any claims you may have directly against the individual who posted the content. You can try to [get in touch with the uploader](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57955). If your lawsuit results in a decision against the individual who posted the content, and if that court order requires us to remove the content from our service, we'll respond accordingly.

Legal Complaints and Court Orders
---------------------------------

If you feel that certain content on the site violates your rights or applicable laws, you may submit a legal complaint under our [trademark](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/trademark_complaint), [defamation](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6154230), [counterfeit](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/counterfeit_complaint), or [other legal](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/2802027#legal_reporting) complaint flows. If you have a court order against an uploader, you may attach a copy of the court order in response to the autoreply that you receive after you file the appropriate legal complaint. Each court order is examined and evaluated based on a set of regional and global criteria.

Bear in mind that you also have other resources to bring content to our attention. For example, if you feel that the content does not comply with our Community Guidelines, please [flag it](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027). Also, consider whether the video meets the standards for removal under our [privacy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801895) or [harassment](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268) policy before filing a legal complaint.

Circumvention of Technological Measures
---------------------------------------

When we say circumvention of technological measures, we're referring to tools that allow users to evade a software's licensing protocol. This can mean serial numbers, keygens, passwords and other methods to hack software or games.

What is the difference between CTM and copyright?

CTM is a tool that will give users the means to access software. Copyright is concerned with the depiction of the software or the means to acquire it. If the software's interface is in the video, or there's a download link to the software in the video or video description, you may wish to file a [copyright takedown notice](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622).

A CTM claim is appropriate when the infringed material isn't present in the video (or directly linked to), but the video offers a way for users to access it illegitimately.

If you believe that you have a valid CTM claim, please fill in our webform.

Captioning
----------

If you've received a notice informing you that your video is in violation of the [Communications and Video Accessibility Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/03/30/2012-7247/closed-captioning-of-internet-protocol-delivered-video-programming-implementation-of-the), you may have uploaded content that was originally shown on TV with captions. The Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) requires that all pre-recorded video programming that is captioned on TV is also captioned on the Internet. If you believe that you're exempt from the CVAA requirement, you may select a [certification](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2789511) for your content.

If you believe that a video is required by the CVAA to contain captions, but the uploader has not made captions available, please submit a request via [webform](https://www.youtube.com/caption_notification).
