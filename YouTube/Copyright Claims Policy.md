Copyright


=============

YouTube is designed to ensure that every player in our ecosystem can be successful.

This includes both protecting rightsholders and giving creators peace of mind so they can focus on producing original content.

How YouTube’s Copyright Protection Tools work
---------------------------------------------

We’ve invested millions of dollars in developing a Copyright Management Suite that’s designed to balance the needs of our entire ecosystem — and we have clear rules when it comes to copyright.

YouTube has worked directly with rightsholders to ensure that copyrighted material on our platform is authorized, and we provide those robust tools to allow rightsholders to notify YouTube of alleged infringement, which we remove in accordance with the law. There are three main tools that make up our Copyright Management Suite:

*   ### Webform
    
    **Who is it for?**
    
    Available in more than 80 languages, all rightsholders have access to the webform, which we’ve built as a streamlined and efficient way to submit copyright removal requests.
    
    **What does it do?**
    
    Rightsholders enter a few details of their request, which is then reviewed by YouTube to see if it meets legal requirements for removing the reported content.
    
    Rights holders have access to powerful features, including the ability to ask YouTube to automatically prevent copies of the removed content from being reuploaded.
    
*   ### Copyright Match Tool
    
    **Who’s it for?**
    
    It helps creators and rights holders protect their content by automatically finding videos that are the same or very similar to ones previously uploaded.
    
    **What does it do?**
    
    If a match is found, the creator or the rights holder is notified. She can then review the video that potentially reused their content and decide whether to request the video’s removal.
    
*   ### Content ID
    
    **Who’s it for?**
    
    Rightsholders who have the most complex rights management needs and experience heavy reposting of copyrighted material, like movie studios and music labels.
    
    **What does it do?**
    
    Rightsholders can pre-determine rules for when content matches are found — choosing to block a whole video from being viewed, monetize the video by running ads against it, or track the video’s viewership stats.
    

How YouTube Addresses Copyright Claims Appeals
----------------------------------------------

The majority of copyright claims and removal requests on YouTube come from our automatic detection technology.

We empower uploaders to report wrongful takedown requests, and we measure how often creators push back against [removals](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807684) and [Content ID claims](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797454) in our [Copyright Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-copyright/intro).

Of the more than 1 billion Content ID claims made between July 2023 and December 2023, fewer than 1% have been disputed. Over 65% of those disputes succeeded, because claimants either voluntarily released the claim or did not respond within the 30-day window, resulting in the claim’s release.

Submit a copyright counter notification
=======================================

A counter notification is a legal request to reinstate content that was removed due to a [copyright removal request](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13823830). If you believe your content was removed by mistake, you can submit a counter notification to [resolve a copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000#resolve).

For videos, you can submit in [YouTube Studio](#studio) or by [email, fax, or mail](#email). For non-video content, such as channel banner images, submit by [email, fax, or mail](#email).

**What to know before you submit:**

*   **When to submit:** Only submit a counter notification if you believe your content was removed due to a mistake. This includes misidentifications of content that may qualify for a copyright exception, such as [fair use](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9783148), fair dealing, or [public domain](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466#public_domain).
*   **Other options:** If you don't believe the content removal was a mistake, you can **wait 90 days** and the [copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000) will expire, as long as you've completed Copyright School. You can also try to [request a retraction](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807691#uploader) to resolve the copyright strike.
*   **Evidence of ownership or permission:** Confirm you own the rights to all elements in your content, including any music (even if it’s just playing in the background). If you’ve used someone else’s copyrighted content, confirm you have a license or [permission](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468#permission) to use it.
*   **What info is shared:** Legally, we’re required to share the counter notification with the claimant. If disclosing personal information is a concern, an authorized representative (such as an attorney) can submit on the uploader's behalf by [email, fax, or mail](#email).
*   **Who submits the notification:** Counter notifications should be submitted by the original uploader of the content at issue. Alternatively, an authorized representative, such as an attorney, can submit on behalf of the uploader.

**Do not submit false information**. Misuse of our processes, such as submitting fraudulent documentation, may result in the termination of your account or other legal consequences.

4\. Legal statements

Agree to and include the following 2 legally required statements:

*   "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which YouTube is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant."
*   "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."

5\. Your signature

Complete and valid copyright counter notifications require the physical or electronic signature of the uploader or a representative authorized to act on their behalf.

To meet this requirement, the uploader or authorized representative should enter their full legal name as their signature at the bottom of the counter notification. A full legal name should be a first and last name, not a company name.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
---------------------------------

What happens after I submit a counter notification?

After a counter notification is submitted, it's **forwarded to the claimant** if it meets all the [requirements](#email), including a clear explanation of why you believe the content was misidentified or removed in error. Counter notifications that don't meet all the requirements may be rejected.

The claimant has **10 US business days**, as required by copyright law, to [respond to the counter notification](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12497556). They must respond with [evidence of legal action](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12497556#evidence) taken to keep your content from being reinstated to YouTube.

If the claimant doesn't do this within this 10-day time period, your **content is reinstated** to YouTube (unless you deleted it) and the associated **copyright strike is cleared** from your channel.

How do I check the status of a counter notification I submitted?

You can check the status of a counter notification from your [YouTube Studio dashboard](http://studio.youtube.com/) or follow those steps:

1.  Sign in to [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/).
2.  From the left menu, select **Content** ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/fqJ4T-KBHjW7EvgvxUdbUqsQ2IfjbnZxtqtfav2U81ZxNkg2gPKjOpi7UX0sqUD0puw=w48-h48).
3.  Click the filter bar ![](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/aaAQPm4xZoEmwh9IM2DxSne_mpp3DPxtGX8T5vRSAz0IyIzMOW1rx31UB73HJS6JeDo=w48-h48) ![and then](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/f0266215-9232-49d1-bb42-a3b46898e6f5) **Copyright**.
4.  Find the video in question.
5.  In the **Restrictions** column, hover over **Copyright**.
6.  Click **See details**.
7.  Look under the **Content used** section to find the status of the counter notification.

Can I cancel a counter notification I submitted?

If you want to cancel a counter notification, you can as long as the claimant hasn't responded to the counter notification yet.

To cancel it, reply directly to YouTube's confirmation email (the email that confirmed the counter notification was received). In your reply, explain that you want to retract your counter notification. You can also email [copyright@youtube.com](mailto:copyright@youtube.com) with this information.

What happens if my counter notification is rejected?

If your counter notification is missing any required information, it may be rejected. You’ll be notified by an email sent to the email address associated with your YouTube channel. The email will have more details on the reason for the rejection.

What you can do next:

*   Reconsider if your content has been removed due to a mistake or misidentification of copyrighted content. If not, you can consider other options to [resolve a copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000#resolve).
*   You can submit a new counter notification that includes all legally required information.

Can I submit 1 counter notification for multiple videos?

Yes, if multiple videos belong to the same copyright strike and you believe they were incorrectly removed, you can submit 1 counter notification for all videos.

If my channel is terminated, can I submit a counter notification?

Yes. You’ll need to submit by [email, fax, or mail](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807684#email) since you don’t have access to YouTube Studio.

Dispute a Content ID claim
==========================

If your video got a [Content ID claim](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6013276), you can dispute a claim if you have a valid reason, such as:

*   Having all the necessary rights to the content in your video.
*   Using the content in a way that qualifies as a copyright exception, such as [fair use](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9783148).
*   Believing your video was misidentified or an error was made.

Copyright strikes are different from Content ID claims. If your channel got a copyright strike, go to the [copyright strikes](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000) article to learn more.

When you dispute a Content ID claim, the person that claimed your video (the claimant) is notified. The claimant has **30 days** to respond.

![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/7jGpcFjsZlB21XObsanSOa6NlH36siHN543n)

Before you dispute
------------------

Before you dispute a Content ID claim, you may want to learn more about [public domain](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797449#c-pd) and copyright exceptions like [fair use](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9783148) or fair dealing. Keep in mind that these are **NOT** legitimate reasons to dispute a claim:

*   [Giving credit](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466#credit) to the copyright owner
*   [Owning a copy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466#purchased) of the video or song
*   [Choosing not to monetize](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466#refrained) on the video

If you don't submit a dispute, there are a few other ways to [resolve a Content ID claim](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6013276#claim_options), such as removing the claimed content from your video.

Ultimately, YouTube can’t decide whether you should dispute a claim. If you’re not sure what to do, you may want to seek legal advice before you dispute.

Keep in mind that you should only dispute a claim **if you're confident that you have all the necessary rights to use the claimed content**. Repeated or malicious abuse of the dispute process can result in penalties against your video or channel.

Submit a dispute

**Note:** You may have an option to **Escalate to Appeal** for Content ID claims that block your video. This option skips the initial dispute step and starts the dispute process with an [appeal](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12104471). Learn more about the [Escalate to Appeal](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12104471#escalate) option.

After you dispute
-----------------

After you submit a dispute, the person that claimed your video (the claimant) has **30 days** to respond.

What the claimant can do

*   **Release the claim:** If the claimant agrees with your dispute, they can release their claim. If you were previously monetizing the video, your monetization settings will be restored automatically when all claims on your video are released. Learn more about [monetization during Content ID disputes](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7000961).
*   **Reinstate the claim:** If the claimant believes that their claim is still valid, they can reinstate it. This means that your dispute was rejected and the claim stays on your video. You may be eligible to [appeal this decision](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12104471).
*   **Submit a takedown request:** If the claimant believes that their claim is still valid, they can submit a [copyright takedown request](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622). If the takedown request is [valid](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622#after), your video is removed from YouTube and your channel gets a [copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000). Learn more about options for [resolving a copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000#resolve).
*   **Let the claim expire:** If the claimant doesn’t respond within 30 days, the claim on your video will expire and be released from your video.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
---------------------------------

What happens if my dispute is rejected?

If your dispute is rejected, the claim will remain on your video. If you're still confident the claim is invalid, you may be eligible to appeal the decision. Learn more about [appealing a Content ID claim](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12104471).

Keep in mind that the claimant can submit a [copyright takedown request](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622) at any time during the dispute process. If this happens and the takedown request is [valid](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622#after), your video would be removed from YouTube and your channel would get a [copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000).

Why does the claimant review both the initial dispute and the appeal?

The initial dispute and the [appeal](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12104471) are reviewed by the claimant because YouTube can’t make ownership determinations. YouTube doesn’t know what content was properly licensed and can’t determine what qualifies for exceptions to copyright, such as [fair use](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9783148) or fair dealing.

The appeal step ensures a more thorough review by the claimant because, if they choose to reinstate their claim, they're required to submit a [copyright takedown request](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622) (a legal process) to keep the video down. After that, if you decide to submit a [counter notification](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807684), the claimant is then required to file a lawsuit to keep your video down.

What's the difference between the dispute and Escalate to Appeal options?

The initial dispute option can take up to **30 days** for the claimant to respond to the dispute. If they reject your dispute, you may be able to appeal the decision. The claimant then has 7 days to respond to the appeal.

The Escalate to Appeal option is only available for Content ID claims that block your video. This option skips the initial dispute step, which gives the claimant 30 days to respond, and starts the process with an appeal. The claimant then has **7 days** to respond, so the process can be resolved faster.

If the claimant rejects your appeal, they could then submit a [copyright takedown request](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622). If the takedown request is [valid](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622#after), your video would be removed from YouTube and your channel would get a [copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000). Keep in mind that you can still submit a [counter notification](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807684) if you're confident that a takedown request is invalid.

Can a video have more than one Content ID claim on it?

Yes, a video can have multiple Content ID claims on it. Note that a video can also have more than one takedown request on it, but can only have one copyright strike at a time.

If I don't dispute a Content ID claim, how can I resolve it?

If you choose not to dispute, there are [other ways](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6013276#claim_options) to resolve a Content ID claim, such as [removing the claimed content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2902117) from your video.

Can I cancel a dispute after it’s submitted?

No, once you’ve submitted a dispute, it can’t be canceled.
