YouTube channel monetization policies
=====================================

**July 15, 2025:** We’re making a minor update to our “repetitious content” policy to better clarify this includes content that is repetitive or mass-produced. We are also renaming this policy from  “repetitious content” to “inauthentic content.” This type of content has always been ineligible for monetization under our existing policies, where creators are rewarded for original and authentic content. There is no change to our reused content policy which reviews content like commentary, clips, compilations, and reaction videos.

**March 10, 2025:** We’re making improvements to our ad suitability review process. As a result, videos undergoing checks (including private videos) may receive an additional review that may be completed by a human. In some cases, video monetization decisions may take up to 24 hours. This update is designed to improve the accuracy of monetization decisions and increase your channel’s overall monetization potential. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16271309).

**March 3, 2022:** Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google and YouTube ads from serving to users located in Russia. Also, we are pausing access to all monetization features (such as Channel Memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Merch) for viewers in Russia. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10008196).

If you’re monetizing on YouTube, it’s important that your channel follows YouTube monetization policies. These include policies described below, as well as YouTube’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines), [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms), [Copyright](https://www.youtube.com/about/copyright/#support-and-troubleshooting), [Rights Clearance Adjustment policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12496325), and our [program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist).

These policies apply to anyone in, or looking to apply to, the YouTube Partner Program. The [YouTube Shorts monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12504220) also apply if you’re monetizing Shorts on YouTube.

All content monetizing with ads must follow our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278). To earn revenue from fan funding features, first time users must accept the Commerce Product Module (CPM) before turning on the individual features. You must also follow the [Commerce Products monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13195878) when monetizing with fan funding features.

Here’s a quick overview of each major policy. Make sure you read each policy thoroughly, as these policies are used to check if a channel is suitable to monetize. Our reviewers regularly check to see whether monetizing channels follow these policies. [Learn more about how we enforce our policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#enforcement).

Keep in mind that when we use the term **video** on this page, it refers to Shorts, long-form videos, and live streaming. These policies apply wherever videos are viewed including the Watch Page (pages within YouTube, YouTube Music, or YouTube Kids), the YouTube Video Player (player that embeds YouTube content on other sites), and the YouTube Shorts Player (player that makes Shorts available).

What we check when we review your channel
-----------------------------------------

If you’re [making money on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857), your content should be original and "authentic." This means that we expect your content to:

*   Be your original creation. If you borrow content from someone else, you need to change it significantly to make it your own.
*   Not be mass-produced or repetitive. It should be made for the enjoyment or education of viewers, rather than for the sole purpose of getting views.

Our reviewers will check your channel and content against our policies. Since they can’t check every video, our reviewers may focus on your channel’s:

*   Main theme
*   Most viewed videos
*   Newest videos
*   Biggest proportion of watch time
*   Video metadata (including titles, thumbnails, and descriptions)
*   Channel’s “About” section

The above are just examples of content our reviewers may assess. Note that our reviewers can, and may check other parts of your channel to see whether it fully meets our policies.

Follow the YouTube Community Guidelines
---------------------------------------

These guidelines help keep YouTube a great community for viewers, creators, and advertisers. Anyone on YouTube needs to follow our Community Guidelines, and any content you post must follow all our [Community Guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567).

Monetizing creators should know that these guidelines apply not only to individual videos, but also to your channel overall. Content that violates YouTube’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines) is not eligible for monetization and will be removed from YouTube.

Follow our program policies

AdSense for YouTube allows YouTube partners to get paid for monetizing their videos. Make sure to follow our [program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist) and YouTube’s [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms).

### Inauthentic Content

Inauthentic content refers to mass-produced or repetitive content. This includes content that looks like it’s made with a template with little to no variation across videos, or content that’s easily replicable at scale.

This policy applies to your channel as a whole. In other words, if you have videos that violate our guidelines, monetization may be removed from your entire channel.

#### What is allowed to monetize

This policy makes sure monetized content offers viewers something appealing and interesting to watch. In other words, if the average viewer can clearly tell that content on your channel differs from video to video, it's fine to monetize. We know many channels create content that follows a similar pattern. What’s important is that the substance of each video should be relatively varied.

Examples of what is allowed to monetize (including but not limited to):

*   Same intro and outro for your videos, but the bulk of your content is different
*   Similar content, where each video talks specifically about the qualities of the subject you’re featuring
*   Short clips of similar objects edited together where you explain how they’re connected

#### Content that violates this guideline

When a channel’s content consists of similar content, it can frustrate viewers who come to YouTube for appealing and interesting videos. That means channels where content is only slightly different from video to video are not allowed to monetize. In other words, your channel shouldn’t have content that's produced using a template and repeated at scale.

Examples of what’s not allowed to monetize (this list is not exhaustive):

*   Content that exclusively features readings of other materials you did not originally create, like text from websites or news feeds
*   Songs modified to change the pitch or speed, but are otherwise identical to the original song
*   Similar repetitive content with low educational value, commentary, narratives, or minimal variation across videos
*   Mass-produced content using a similar template across multiple videos
*   Image slideshows or scrolling text with minimal or no narrative, commentary, or educational value

### Reused content

Reused content refers to channels that repurpose content that’s already on YouTube or another online source without adding significant original commentary, substantive modifications, or educational or entertainment value. Reused content may also be known as duplicative or scraped content (taking unique or original content from other websites and publishing it as your own).

To figure out whether your content is reused, our reviewers will check your channel to understand how you created, participated in, or produced your content. Our reviewers may check your channel’s:

*   Videos
*   Channel description
*   Video title
*   Video descriptions

Our reused content policy applies to your channel as a whole. If you have videos that violate our guidelines, or if we cannot clearly tell that you made the content, monetization may be removed from your entire channel.

#### What is allowed to monetize

We want to reward creators for original and "authentic" content that adds value to viewers. If you put a funny or thoughtful spin on content you didn’t originally create (in line with our guidelines below), you’ve transformed the content in some way. It’s fine to have this type of content on your channel, but individual videos may be subject to other policies like [copyright](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466). In other words, we allow reused content if viewers can tell that there’s a meaningful difference between the original video and your video.

**Note:** While these examples do not violate the reused content monetization policy, other policies, such as [copyright](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466), still apply.

Examples of what’s allowed to monetize (including but not limited to):

*   Using clips for a critical review
*   A scene from a movie where you’ve rewritten the dialog and changed the voiceover
*   Replays of a sports tournament where you explain the moves a competitor did to succeed
*   Reaction videos where you comment on the original video
*   Edited footage from other creators where you add a storyline and commentary
*   Edits to remixed content on Shorts like adding original content to a song from our library, or adding the original audio or video segment from other videos to your content
*   Content that primarily features the uploading creator in the video
*   Reused content from other online sources where the creator is either visible in the content or explains how the creator added to the content
*   Edited footage with audio and visual effects on top of the video’s reused content that demonstrates substantive editing and shows it’s unique to your channel

#### Content that violates this guideline

Taking someone else’s content, making minimal changes, and calling it your own original work would be a violation of this guideline. If we cannot tell that the content is yours, it may be subject to our reused content policy. This policy applies even if you have permission from the original creator. Reused content is separate from YouTube’s Copyright enforcement, which means it’s not based on copyright, permission, or fair use. This guideline means sometimes, you may not get claims against your content, but your channel may still violate our reused content guidelines.

More examples of what’s not allowed to monetize (this list is not exhaustive):

*   Clips of moments from your favorite show edited together with little or no narrative
*   Short videos you compiled from other social media websites
*   Collections of songs from different artists (even if you have their permission)
*   Content uploaded many times by other creators
*   Promotion of other people’s content (even if you have permission)
*   Content downloaded or copied from another online source without any substantive modifications
*   Content that gets views from mostly non-verbal reactions to your videos without added voice commentary

Quality principles for kids and family content

Our aim is to provide kids and families with a safe and enriching experience on YouTube, while finding new ways to reward creators contributing high-quality content to the platform.

If your channel has ["made for kids” content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076), we’ll use YouTube’s [quality principles for kids and family content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) to determine the monetization status of that content.

If a channel is found to have a strong focus on low-quality “made for kids” content, it may be [suspended](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1727191#ypp-participation-suspended) from the YouTube Partner Program. If an individual video is found to violate these quality principles, it may see [limited or no ads](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9208564).

When checking to see if your “made for kids” content is of low or high quality, nuances and context are important. Visit our [best practices for kids and family content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) page for guides and examples.

### Application of quality principles for monetization eligibility

There are several [low-quality principles](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223) that may affect the overall quality of a particular video. We will consider each principle as a factor for monetization eligibility on a rolling basis. We currently enforce against the low-quality principles for kids and family content listed below. We may increase the scope to include more quality principles over time.

*   _**Heavily promotional:**_ Content that mainly features products, brands and logos (such as toys or food), or encourages excessive buying like unboxing videos.
*   _**Encouraging negative behaviors or attitudes:**_ Content that encourages dangerous activities, wastefulness, bullying, dishonesty, or a lack of respect for others. For example, this content could include dangerous/unsafe pranks, unhealthy eating habits.
*   _**Deceptively educational:**_ This refers to content that uses titles or thumbnails to trick kids into thinking it's educational, when it's really not. It might promise to teach something, like colors or numbers, but show incorrect or unhelpful information.
*   _**Hard to follow:**_ Videos that are confusing or make no sense, often due to jumbled storylines, unclear audio, or lack of clear storyline (beginning, middle & end). This type of video is often the result of mass production or autogeneration.
*   _**Sensational or misleading:**_ Content that is untrue, exaggerated, or bizarre and may confuse a young audience. It might also include “keyword stuffing”, or the practice of using popular keywords of interest to children in a repetitive, altered, or exaggerated way. The keywords may also be used in a way that does not make sense.
*   _**Strange use of children’s characters:**_ This content takes characters kids know and love (animated or live action) and puts them in inappropriate or potentially risky situations.

Creator responsibility

The success of your channel and the YouTube Partner Program is dependent upon the willingness of advertisers to associate their brands with YouTube content. The earnings of all YouTube creators are negatively impacted when advertisers lose trust.

We don’t allow egregious behavior that has a large negative impact on the community. This policy means you should be respectful of your viewers, your fellow creators, and our advertisers -- both on and off YouTube.

If you violate this policy, we may temporarily turn off your monetization or terminate your accounts. This may apply to all of your existing channels, any new channels you create, and channels that you appear on regularly.

If any of your channels have been demonetized or terminated, you should not create new (or use existing) channels to get around these restrictions, or apply to YPP with related channels during your suspension period. Doing so could lead to termination of all channels.

Learn more about [Creator responsibility](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7650329).

Creator integrity

We expect creators in the YouTube Partner Program to be who they say they are and not misrepresent themselves by manipulating their on-platform activity or engaging in deceptive practices.

This means creators should not [artificially inflate](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767) a channel’s engagement, such as views, subs, likes, watch time, and ad impressions. Similarly, creators should not encourage organic engagement on non-compliant content before deleting or obfuscating that content. Engaging in this type of behavior may result in removal from the YouTube Partner Program or termination of your channels. See our [program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?ctx=checklist) for more info

Creators should also not mislead users or YouTube by participating in financially abusive behaviors, such as using our monetization features for illegal, fraudulent, or deceptive transactions. If you violate this policy, we may remove you from the YouTube Partner Program or terminate your channels.

How we'll inform you of policy changes

YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service, and adapting to the world around us. We may need to make changes to the terms and conditions or policies that apply to your use of the Service - including the Terms of Service, and the YouTube Partner Program Terms, our policies, and other contractual documents - to reflect changes to our Service or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons.

We’ll let you know in writing when we make changes that might impact you. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may stop using the relevant feature, or terminate your agreement with us.

To help you stay up to date with our policies, we also maintain a permanent log of updates. [View our changelog here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10008196).

How we enforce YouTube monetization policies

Anyone who earns money on YouTube must follow YouTube's channel monetization policies. If you violate any of our policies, YouTube may take the actions outlined below.

Limited Availability
--------------------

Monetization features may not be available in all locations. In addition, due to the suspension of Google advertising systems in Russia, creators cannot monetize any YouTube channels linked to AdSense for YouTube accounts based in Russia. Creators in Russia cannot complete new YPP sign-ups at this time. Monetization features (such as Channel Memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Merch) have also been paused for viewers in Russia. Monetization has also been paused for all Russian Federation state-funded media channels.

Withhold, adjust, charge back, or offset earnings or payment

We may withhold or adjust any of your earnings associated with violations of the YouTube channel monetization policies. We may also [charge back](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/12843009#nqrevenues) associated earnings against any AdSense for YouTube balance that has not yet been disbursed or offset such amounts against future earnings payable to you.

For any such violations, we need some time to investigate whether the earnings need to be withheld, adjusted, or offset. This may result in payment delays of up to 90 days or until we’ve resolved any third-party rights disputes.

Examples of violations where we might need to withhold or adjust your earnings include (but aren’t limited to) instances of:

*   [Invalid traffic](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10285842) on your content
*   [Fake engagement](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767)
*   [Content ID claims](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6013276)

If your channel is [terminated](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168) or [suspended](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#suspension) from the YouTube Partner Program, you are no longer entitled to earn any revenue. YouTube may also withhold earnings and refund advertisers or viewers for purchases where appropriate and possible.

We’ll inform you in writing by email or in product when we have to enforce our policies. We will also let you know what options are available to you.

Limit ad revenue from your videos
---------------------------------

As a member of the YouTube Partner Program, you can make your videos eligible to earn ad revenue if they meet our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278). However, if your videos are found to not meet our advertiser-friendly guidelines, or if they violate other policies, such as our [age restriction](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802167) or [copyright guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797466), your videos may earn limited or no ad revenue.

For more information about reasons why content may not be eligible for monetization, see: [Monetization icon guide for YouTube Studio](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9208564)

Suspend your participation in the YouTube Partner Program

Violation of our YouTube channel monetization policies may result in monetization being suspended or permanently disabled on all or any of your accounts. If it’s determined that your channel is no longer eligible for monetization, your channel may lose access to all monetization tools, features, and Modules associated with the YouTube Partner Program. You may also choose to opt out of specific monetization Modules at any time by contacting Creator Support.

#### Data retention

If your monetization agreement with YouTube is terminated, you still can request your YouTube Analytics data from the time you were in the program by contacting Creator Support.

For more information about suspensions, including troubleshooting tips and details about how to reapply to join the program, see: [Monetization is disabled for my channel](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1727191)

Suspend or even terminate your YouTube channel
----------------------------------------------

In exceptional circumstances we may need to terminate a channel, account, or disable a user’s access to the Service in order to protect the integrity of the platform or protect our users from harm. Learn more about [channel terminations](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en) and [disabled Google Accounts](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695), including what you can do if you believe your channel or account was terminated by mistake.

YouTube Shorts monetization policies
====================================

Monetizing partners can earn money from ads that are viewed between videos in the Shorts Feed.

**What you'll find in this article**

This article explains:

*   [Policies that apply to YouTube Shorts monetization](#policies)
*   [Ad formats eligible for Shorts revenue sharing](#ad-formats)
*   [How ad revenue sharing works for Shorts](#how-it-works)
*   [Where to see your Shorts Feed ad revenue](#yta)
*   [Learn more about YouTube Shorts monetization](#faq)

Policies that apply to YouTube Shorts monetization
--------------------------------------------------

If you’re monetizing on YouTube, it’s important your channel follows the [YouTube channel monetization policies](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392), including our policies on [repetitious and reused content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#cqg). This also includes YouTube’s [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines), [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms), [Copyright](https://www.youtube.com/about/copyright/#support-and-troubleshooting), and [Google AdSense program policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182).

### Turning on Shorts ad revenue sharing

To start sharing in Shorts ad revenue, monetizing partners will need to accept the Shorts Monetization Module—terms that let you earn from ads and YouTube Premium in the Shorts Feed. Shorts ad revenue sharing will apply to your channel’s eligible Shorts views starting on the date you accept. Shorts views accrued prior to accepting the Shorts Monetization Module are not eligible for Shorts ad revenue sharing.

### Content suitable for ads

All content monetizing with ads must follow our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278). On Shorts, only views of content that follow our advertiser-friendly guidelines will be eligible for revenue sharing.

### Ineligible Shorts views

For the purposes of calculating payments, YouTube uses eligible “Engaged views”. This means YouTube won’t count engaged views that are ineligible. Examples where ineligible Shorts views may occur:

*   Non-original Shorts, such as unedited clips from others' movies or TV shows, reuploading other creators' content from YouTube or other platform, or compilations with no [original content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#cqg) added
*   [Artificial](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10285842) or [fake](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3399767) views of Shorts, such as from automated click or scroll bots
*   Views of Shorts that are inconsistent with our [advertiser-friendly content guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278)

Blocked Shorts
--------------

Shorts over one minute in length that contain claimed content are blocked and not eligible for monetization. Learn about [three-minutes Shorts](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/15424877) and [music eligibility for Shorts](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13486873).

Ad formats eligible for Shorts revenue sharing
----------------------------------------------

Revenue is shared on ads that are viewed between videos in the Shorts Feed. Shorts views exclusively receive ad revenue sharing from the Shorts Feed, which is separate from long-form video monetization on the Watch Page.

How ad revenue sharing works for Shorts
---------------------------------------

Only monetizing partners who’ve accepted the Shorts Monetization Module can earn ad revenue from Shorts.

There are four steps to how Shorts ad revenue sharing works:

1.  **Pool Shorts Feed ad revenue**. Each month, revenue from ads running between videos in the Shorts Feed gets added together and used to both reward creators and help cover costs of music licensing.
2.  **Calculate the Creator Pool**. Shorts Feed ad revenue is then allocated into the **Creator Pool** based on engaged views and music usage across Shorts uploaded by monetizing creators.
    *   **If a monetizing creator uploads a Short without any music**, all of the revenue associated with it goes into the Creator Pool.
    *   **If a monetizing creator uploads a Short with music in it**, then YouTube will split the revenue associated with its views between the Creator Pool and music partners based on the number of tracks used.

For example, if a monetizing creator uploads a Short with 1 track, half of the revenue associated with its engaged views would be allocated to the Creator Pool, and the other half used to cover the costs of music licensing. If the Short features 2 music tracks, then one third of the revenue associated with its engaged views would be allocated to the Creator Pool, and the other two thirds used to cover the costs of music licensing.

3.  **Allocate the Creator Pool**. From the overall amount in the Creator Pool, revenue is distributed to monetizing creators based on their share of total engaged views from monetizing creators’ Shorts in each country. For example, if a creator gets 5% of all eligible engaged Shorts views uploaded by monetizing creators, they’ll be allocated 5% of the revenue in the Creator Pool.
4.  **Apply revenue share**. Monetizing creators will keep 45% of their allocated revenue, regardless if music was used or not.

What’s not included in the Creator Pool:

*   Revenue associated with views of Shorts uploaded by creators who haven’t yet accepted the Shorts Monetization Module, or aren’t yet eligible to monetize their Shorts. This revenue will be used to cover the costs of music licensing and/or be retained by YouTube.
*   Revenue associated with views of Shorts uploaded by music partners.
*   Revenue associated with views of Shorts that are determined to be ineligible.
*   Revenue associated with any ads shown upon opening the Shorts Feed before a Short is viewed (e.g. the YouTube Shorts Masthead).
*   Revenue associated with any ads shown on navigational pages within the Shorts player.

### Understand with an example

Let’s review a hypothetical example to better understand how this works.

**Hypothetical example**

As a monetizing creator, let’s say you upload a Short that uses 1 music track. Here’s how we’d calculate what your Short earns in Country A this month.

*   There are 100 million total engaged Shorts views in Country A, and all are on Shorts uploaded by monetizing creators.
*   $100,000 is earned from ads that play between Shorts in the Shorts Feed.
*   20% of these Shorts use 1 music track, so the Creator Pool is $90,000 and $10,000 is used to cover the costs of music licensing.
*   Your Short has 1 million engaged views, so you are allocated 1% of the Creator Pool, or $900. Your allocation from the Creator Pool is not affected by your use of a music track.
*   The 45% revenue share is then applied to your allocation, and you earn $405 for your Shorts views in Country A.

#### Use of third-party content in Shorts

In certain circumstances, when a Short features third-party content or [remixed content](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10623810), the views allocated to the Short will be divided between the uploader and any third-party rightsholders (owners of other content used in a Short) for the purposes of calculating the Creator Pool and revenue share to monetizing creators. The following policies describe how this will occur. We may update these policies and will inform you of any changes.

*   **How use of third-party content affects the Creator Pool**. When the amount of the Creator Pool is calculated, **only music content** made available by YouTube's music industry partners or generated by Dream Track will be credited as making a contribution to a Short. This means that only when music content is used in a Short will it reduce the amount of engaged views and associated revenue allocated to the Creator Pool. No other category of third-party content will be credited as making a contribution to a Short at this time, even when a Content ID monetize policy is set on that content. However, we are in the early stages of developing our monetization model for other categories of content.
    *   The examples above show how engaged views and associated revenue are split to calculate the Creator Pool when music content is used in a Short.
*   **How use of third-party content affects allocations from the Creator Pool**. When paying monetizing creators their share from the Creator Pool, each monetizing creator will be allocated 100% of the total number of engaged views on their Shorts, regardless of whether any music (including music generated by Dream Track) is used in the Short. As a result, using music in a Short won't affect a creator’s allocation from the Creator Pool or their revenue share rate.

#### YouTube Premium subscription revenue sharing for Shorts

[YouTube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium) is a paid subscription option which enables users to enjoy ad-free content, background playback, downloads, and premium access to the YouTube Music app. This offering also applies to engaged views on Shorts.

YouTube will pay 45% of the net revenue from YouTube Premium that is allocated to monetizing creators for Shorts. A portion of YouTube Premium revenues are allocated to help cover costs of music licensing. Payments to each creator are based on their share of subscription Shorts views within each country.

### Where to see your Shorts Feed ad revenue

YouTube Analytics will start displaying estimated daily Shorts Feed ad revenue along with other performance metrics when available, or from the day you start monetizing with Shorts ads. Learn more about how to [check your YouTube revenue](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9314488).

Existing timelines for [payment thresholds](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1709871) and other AdSense for YouTube details apply—learn more about [AdSense for YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/11602441).

#### Studio Content Manager

For Studio Content Manager users, [downloadable reports](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6085590) will be available for non-music partners only. These reports will include revenue details segmented by date and country/region for any monetizing Shorts uploaded by relevant partners.

Why is Shorts ad revenue being pooled?
--------------------------------------

Shorts uses an ad format different from long-form video, requiring us to take a unique approach to revenue sharing. By pooling revenue and then distributing it based on share of engaged views, we aim to reward all monetizing creators who make up the Shorts experience, not just those who have an ad next to their video. As an additional benefit, this model also simplifies the complexities of music licensing, enabling creators to achieve their creative vision without worrying about earning less due to music use.

Do creators actually get to keep 45% of Shorts revenue?
-------------------------------------------------------

Each month, revenue from ads appearing between videos in the Shorts Feed is pooled together and used to reward Shorts creators and cover the costs of music licensing. From the overall amount allocated to creators (also known as the Creator Pool), they keep 45% of the revenue, regardless of whether they use music in their Shorts.

What do you mean by "music" specifically?

“Music” in the context of Shorts refers to content made available or claimed by YouTube's music industry partners. This may include actual music audio or tracks, music videos, or other music content like artist interviews. It also includes music content generated by Dream Track.

Why is my 1-3 minute Short not eligible for the Shorts revenue sharing model?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you uploaded a three-minute video before October 15, 2024 and want to monetize it as a Short, make sure there is an active first-party claim on a video. Three-minute Shorts uploaded after October 15, 2024 can monetize in the Shorts revenue sharing model. [Learn more about three-minute Shorts](https://support.google.com/in-yt-shorts/answer/15424877).

Your video is not eligible for monetization. Please review [what content isn't eligible for Shorts monetization](#suitable-content) and [find your claimed videos](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/106993).

My Shorts are in the Shorts Feed, but I'm not earning revenue. Can I earn money from those ads without being in YPP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Only monetizing partners who’ve accepted the Shorts Monetization Module can earn ad and YouTube Premium revenue from Shorts. The remaining revenue will be used to cover the costs of music licensing or be retained by YouTube.

How will I know if my Shorts are earning ad revenue? What if I want to stop earning Shorts ad revenue?

From the date you accept the Shorts Monetization Module, engaged views of any Short on your channel will be considered for Shorts ad revenue sharing. Shorts views accrued prior to accepting the Shorts Monetization Module are not eligible for Shorts ad revenue sharing.

After uploading your Short, you can see its monetization status in the Content section of YouTube Studio. Shorts with views being considered for Shorts ad revenue sharing will show a green or yellow monetization icon. Learn more about the different icons in our [Monetization icon guide](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9208564).

YouTube Analytics will also start displaying estimated daily Shorts Feed ad revenue along with other performance metrics on the date you start monetizing with Shorts ads. Learn more about how to [check your YouTube revenue](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9314488).

If you no longer want to monetize your channel’s Shorts views with ads, you can opt out of the Shorts Monetization Module by contacting [Creator Support](https://support.google.com/youtube/gethelp).

### Verifying Your AdSense Account

To earn money from Virtual items on YouTube, you need to be at least 18 years old and have a verified AdSense account. Creators who have not gone through the AdSense ID verification process will be notified to do so when you attempt to enable gifts.

If you do not see this notification or do not have a verified AdSense account, you can reach out to Creator Support to trigger [AdSense Identity Verification](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/7568896) (IDV).

To check whether your AdSense account is verified, follow these steps:

Sign in to the AdSense account associated with your channel and select **Payments** then **Verification** **check**.

*   If you see “Identity Verification” marked as Completed, then your AdSense account is verified.
*   If you do not see “Identity Verification” listed, and you meet the minimum requirements listed above, reach out to Creator Support to trigger AdSense IDV.

**Note:** You have 45 days from the date AdSense first asks you to verify your identity to submit the required documents in your account. After 45 days, if you haven't provided the documents or AdSense is still unable to verify your identity from the documents you have provided, monetization will be paused on your channel until it’s complete.

How revenue works for Virtual Items
-----------------------------------

Here’s how you earn revenue from Virtual Items on YouTube:

1.  **A viewer who has purchased Jewels redeems some of their Jewels for gifts during your live stream**. A viewer wants to show appreciation and interact in real-time, so they redeem some of their Jewels to send gifts during the live stream. The gifts help you engage with your fans in real-time and build excitement during the live stream.
2.  **You earn Rubies from the gifts sent during the live stream**. You can view how many estimated Rubies you earned from gifts during your live stream and when it ends. Every two Jewels redeemed for gifts will earn you one Ruby.
3.  **The Rubies you’ve earned during the live stream represent your revenue**. We will calculate your net revenue by multiplying the number of Rubies you earned by the revenue we pay per Ruby, which is $0.01.

You can view the number of Rubies you’ve earned during live streams and the associated [revenue in YouTube Analytics](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9314488).
