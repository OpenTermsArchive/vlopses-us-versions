A user shall not qualify as a “New App User” according to (b) in the foregoing sentence more than once. Only Temu users who reside in the designated countries/regions as displayed on the Promotion page will be qualified as New App Users. A “New App User” will be considered to have been referred by you only if (a) they acquire New App User status by clicking your Referral Link within 1 hour of their action; or (b) they search for your Referral Code in the Temu application within 1 hour of acquiring New App User status.

(v) “Referral Link/Code” refers to a unique link/code we generate for each Affiliate and can be found on the Program page after you join the Program. You may only earn Affiliate Benefits on users referred through the Traffic Source of the provided channels via your Affiliate Link. In addition to the Traffic Sources listed on the Program page, other Traffic Source may also be accepted at our sole discretion. Further, not all links or posts under an approved Traffic Source/Channel will necessarily be acceptable. You may contact us for further details. No Traffic Source restrictions apply to referrals made using a Referral Code.

(vi) “Affiliate Benefits” refers to all the rewards, commission, bonus and any other form of benefits you may earn in this Program (including any sub-program and/or campaign), such as Affiliate Earnings and/or Affiliate Credit.

(vii)“Affiliate Earnings” refers to the Commission, New App User Bonus and/or other benefits earned in the Program and issued to your “Available Earnings” balance, which will be displayed in your account. Your Affiliate Earnings shall be earned and withdrawn subject to the limitations set forth in the attached Exhibit A (Affiliate Earnings Terms and Conditions), which Exhibit is incorporated in this Policy.

(viii) “Affiliate Credits” refers to the credits rewards earned in the Program and issued to your “Affiliate Credits” balance, which will be displayed in your account. Please note that Affiliate Credits, which can only be withdrawn as [Temu Credits](https://www.temu.com/temu-credit-balance-policy.html) to your Temu user account, are not transferrable nor redeemable for cash. General rules set by Temu on [Temu Credits](https://www.temu.com/temu-credit-balance-policy.html) will apply.

(ix)“Channel” or “Traffic Source” refers to a channel approved by Temu through which Affiliates may refer users under the Program via the Referral Links, including a social group, coupon or deals site, or other applicable channels.

(x)“Traffic Verification Process” refers to the process that you must complete after registration. During the Traffic Verification Process, you are required to provide the requested information and documentation related to one of the Channels you may use—such as the Channel link, profile screenshots, and other relevant materials—for Temu’s review. The review outcome shall be determined at Temu’s sole discretion and shall be binding on you. Please note that before you have passed the Traffic Verification Process, we may restrict the Channels you may use when making referrals via your Affiliate Link, and you will not be eligible to earn additional Affiliate Benefits once your “Available Earnings” balance has accumulated up to the designated threshold. Any additional Affiliate Benefits will be recognized but not be credited to your account until approval is granted. In addition, any Affiliate Benefits reflected in your “Pending” balance may not be transferred to your “Available Earnings” balance in accordance with the normal rules set forth in the Policy. If you fail to pass the Traffic Verification Process within the specified timeframe, your Affiliate account will be suspended. Upon suspension, you may no longer be able to participate in any campaigns or events under the Program or earn any Affiliate Benefits. In addition, any Affiliate Benefits that have not been transferred to your “Available Earnings” balance (e.g., those reflected in your “Pending” balance) will be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may, within a limited period specified by Temu, withdraw the amounts in your “Available Earnings” balance in accordance with this Policy. Upon expiration of such period, your Affiliate account will be permanently terminated, and any remaining balances will be forfeited and no longer be eligible for withdrawal.

You can earn the Temu commission (“Commission”) on the following orders (“Qualifying Orders”) once you complete the traffic verification process and the channel you use to refer users (each a “Channel”) has been reviewed and approved by Temu. To complete the verification process, you must select the type of your Channel (i.e., a social group, content blog, coupon&deals site, individual developer, or other channel) and provide the required information and documents—such as your Channel link, profile screenshots, and other relevant materials—for our review. The review outcome is determined at Temu’s sole discretion. The Commission can be earned only once per Qualifying Order.

(i) The first ten (10) orders placed by each New App User referred by you within 30 days of their New App User status being acquired;

(ii) The first one (1) order placed by each New Web User referred by you;

(iii) Other Qualifying Orders described in any sub-program.

If a Qualifying Order is made in a currency different than the currency used to calculate your Affiliate Earnings, then the Commission earned by you on such Qualifying Order will be converted into the currency used to calculate your Affiliate Earnings at the exchange rate displayed on the Program page when such Qualifying Order is made. The exchange rates between different currencies will be updated monthly.

You will also get a bonus for each New App User referred by you (“New App User Bonus”). The New App User Bonus will be credited to your “Pending” balance two days following the referral and will not be transferred to your “Available Earnings” balance until (i) the New App User referred by you makes their first Qualifying Order within 30 day(s) of acquiring New App User status; and (ii) 30 days have passed since the order has been confirmed as delivered.

If these conditions are not met, the New App User Bonus will be canceled by Temu.

The rates of Commission (“Commission Rate”) and any other Affiliate Benefits you may earn on Temu users residing in different countries/regions may be different. The detailed rules will be displayed on the Program page and/or stipulated in any sub-program/campaign rules.

If a Qualifying Order is cancelled, refunded, or returned, whether partially or in full, the Commission earned on such Qualifying Order will be canceled and forfeited. If such Commission has been withdrawn by you, Temu is entitled to get a refund of such amount from you.

Traffic Source Requirements.

For certain categories of Affiliates or specific promotional activities (e.g., Facebook Group administrators), Temu may require that traffic and resulting Qualifying Orders originate exclusively from pre-approved and designated sources (such as specific social media groups, websites, or links you provided and were approved during onboarding). Commissions for activations and orders from unapproved sources will not be recognized or settled. The specific requirements for your affiliate type will be communicated to you during onboarding and/or displayed on the Program page.

(iv) “Data Anomalies” shall mean factually inaccurate data that is the product of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or concealment, including but not limited to fabrication or falsification of data, provision of invalid data or other behaviors that cause data anomalies decided including but not limited by Temu itself. Invalid data and data anomalies shall mean data generated by non-human browsing of advertising materials, such as by machines or bots. This includes:

• Ad impressions, clicks, and page views generated without the user's knowledge.

• Ad monitoring requests triggered at the wrong time.

• Other traffic that Temu reasonably deems suspicious.

Invalid data and data anomalies include, but are not limited to, the following:

• Traffic from bots, crawlers (also known as "web spiders"), or other automated systems that are disguised as legitimate users, as well as traffic from non-browser user agents or other forms of unknown browsers.

• Traffic data that exceeds the frequency or time interval limits reasonably associated with human traffic, such as high-speed, continuous, or repeated requests that appear to be abnormal based on user behavior in advertising campaigns.

• Traffic with missing or inconsistent user agent information, or traffic from non-browser user agents or other forms of unknown browsers, or traffic that lacks key data information for valid traffic.

• Traffic where users are unable to see the normally delivered ad content due to hiding, stacking, covering, or other methods.

• Known traffic from data centers (traffic from specific network IPs or IP ranges that clearly originate from non-human access to advertising materials).

• Traffic from pre-fetching or browser previews of ads.

• Known traffic from high-risk or fraudulent sources.

• Traffic with missing or inconsistent basic information (at least event type, creative ID, timestamp, IP, request method, user agent UA field).

• Regular routine testing traffic initiated by the media owner on Temu-provided click links and landing pages.

• Traffic initiated by Temu or its representative in consultation with the media owner for testing purposes.

• Manipulation or falsification of location data and related attributes.

• Invalid proxy traffic (i.e., invalid traffic from intermediary proxy devices, including traffic count manipulation through proxy devices, creation/transmission of non-human traffic, or traffic that cannot be verified by the protocol).

• Examples:

• A user generates a large number of impression or click logs for a particular ad in a short period of time, which is significantly different from normal browsing behavior. A user generates a click log without a corresponding impression log.

• The Referrer information in the impression or click logs contains URLs of media, channels, or pages outside the agreed-upon scope of the Parties. The Use Agent information in the impression or click logs contains operating system or browser information outside the agreed-upon scope of the Parties.

• In an ad campaign without IP address targeting, click or impression logs are concentrated in the same address or address range. In an ad campaign without time targeting, click or impression logs are concentrated in a certain time period of a day. In an ad campaign without operating system or browser targeting, the distribution of operating systems and browsers in the click or impression logs is significantly different from the general population.

Exhibit B – Endorsement Guideline
---------------------------------

Temu believes in full, fair and effective disclosures of material facts relating to the Affiliates’ relationship with Temu in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, such as Federal Trade Balance/commission’ Guides Concerning Endorsements and Testimonials [https: //www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-07-26/pdf/2023-14795.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-07-26/pdf/2023-14795.pdf).

1\. Disclose Connection to Temu - When posting about the Temu or the Temu’s products or services, Affiliate must clearly disclose Affiliate’s “material connections” with the Temu, including the fact that Affiliate was afforded any consideration from the Temu or is being paid for a particular service. “Material connections” are defined as any connection between an Affiliate and a Temu that could affect the credibility consumers give to the Affiliate’s statements. Important examples of “material connections” include payments or other monetary compensation, loaner or free products and services, gifts and rewards, special access privileges and other incentives provided by a Temu to an Affiliate.

2\. Maintain Clear and Prominent Disclosure - The above disclosure should be made in close proximity to any statements that the Affiliate makes about the Temu or the Temu’s products or services. This disclosure should be clear and prominent enough for consumers to view it when they are reading Affiliate’s posts. This means that the disclosure should not be buried behind links or in the Terms and Conditions (or in similar documents). In addition, the consumer should not be required to click on, scroll down or mouse over a link in order to view the disclosure. This also means that the disclosure should not be placed below the “more” button or in a “jumble of hashtags” that readers are not likely to read. When determining where to place a disclosure, consider the following:

• A disclosure is required regardless of the space limitations of the medium (e.g., X(Twitter), Instagram), where the disclosure can be made via hashtags, such as #Temued, #paid or #ad.

• Hashtags such as #partner or #thanks without further context are unlikely to be considered sufficient.When in doubt, please consult Temu.

• For Instagram, the disclosure should appear in the first two (2) lines of the post and above the “more” button.

• Please do not rely solely on social media “paid partnership” or “handshake” tools. A clear and conspicuous disclosure must be included in the copy or, in the case of Instagram Stories or Snapchat Stories, superimposed on the image. When in doubt, please consult Temu.

• For longer posts (e.g., blogs), the disclosure should appear closer to the top of the post and not be buried at the bottom of the post or after blocks of text that consumers are unlikely to read.

• On Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram stories, the disclosure can be superimposed over the visuals in a clear and conspicuous manner.

• In video or YouTube posts, the disclosure should appear in the video itself at the beginning of the video (note that this disclosure may also appear in the description box “above the fold” provided it also appears in the video itself).

• Visual disclosures must stand out and be on the screen long enough to be noticed, read and understood.

• As a best practice, include multiple disclosures throughout the course of the video (or one continuous disclosure). On YouTube, a visual disclosure that is obscured by ads will not be clear and conspicuous.

3\. Give Your Honest and Truthful Opinions – Affiliate’s statements should always reflect Affiliate’s honest and truthful opinions and actual experiences. However, we do ask that all blog entries, Facebook posts, tweets, and/or comments be in good taste and free of inappropriate language and/or any content that promotes bigotry, racism or discrimination against an individual based on race, gender, religion, nationality, disability sexual orientation or age.

4\. Only Make Factual Statements That Are Truthful and Can Be Verified - In an effort to accurately relay brand names, product attributes and program information, please refer to all Temu-provided materials, if available, when developing content pertaining to Temu or Temu’s products. Most importantly, Affiliate should only make factual statements about Temu or Temu’s product’s characteristics or quality which Affiliate knows for certain is true and can be verified. For example, Affiliate should not make statements about the performance of a product unless Affiliate has support for such claims.

5\. Respect Intellectual Property Rights - Intellectual Property is the group of legal rights to works that people create or invent. Intellectual property rights typically include copyright, trademark, and trade secret rights, as well as the right to use someone's name, likeness or voice. Examples include photographs, videos, music, trademarks/logos, personal names/likenesses (including celebrities’ names/likenesses), and writings. Affiliate should never post or share any content that violates or infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party. If Affiliate is unsure about a work, particularly in instances where a work includes a third-party’s trademark/logo, or music, film or television clips, or a celebrity’s name, photo or image, Affiliate should check with Temu before using the work. A good rule of thumb is, if in doubt, do not post it.

6\. Comply with other policies and laws – Affiliate should comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as the terms, conditions, guidelines and policies of any social media platform or service that Affiliate uses in connection with the Services.

7\. Do not alter – Affiliate should not alter or modify any logo, image, copyright or trademark provided by the Temu if Affiliate chooses to include such item in a blog entry, post or tweet.

8\. Do not be Inappropriate - Affiliate should not associate Temu or any of Temu’s products or services with any inappropriate or controversial content that would reflect poorly upon Temu or the Program.

9\. Do not exhort to children – Affiliates must avoid making statements in Posts which encourage children to buy, or persuade an adult to buy for them, any Product or Service.

10\. Respect Confidentiality - Affiliate may learn of confidential information that is not yet public. Affiliate shall take all necessary precautions in handling the confidential information and limit disclosures on a strict need-to-know basis. In the event Affiliate has any questions regarding the confidentially of specific knowledge obtained at the event, Affiliate should reach out to the appropriate contact at the Temu before sharing the information.

PLEASE NOTE THAT TEMU RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MONITOR AFFILIATE’S COMPLIANCE WITH THESE GUIDELINES AND TO TERMINATE AFFILIATE’S PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM IN THE EVENT OF ANY NONCOMPLIANCE.
