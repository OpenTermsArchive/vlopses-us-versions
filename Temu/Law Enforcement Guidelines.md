Guidelines for Record Request
=============================

Last Updated: December 20, 2023

Temu and its corporate affiliates (collectively referred to as “Temu”) receive numerous requests for records or information concerning Temu’s customers, merchandise partners, and transactions in various forms. This policy explains how Temu responds to such requests and sets forth basic guidelines for law enforcement and governmental entities on submitting their data requests in connection with investigations and inquiries. Please note that this policy does not constitute legal advice or represent that Temu will respond to such requests in a specific manner.

Records and Information Access
------------------------------

Before submitting legal process to Temu, please check publicly-available records on the Temu (including but not limited to Temu website, mobile app, or other Temu-branded services). In addition, you may obtain records directly from the relevant merchandise partners and customers. Information or records such as Temu policies (including but not limited to Terms of Use, Privacy & Cookie Policy), names of merchandise partners, customer reviews, products images and description, are publicly available on Temu. Also, customers can access their own transaction records by logging into their Temu accounts.

Required Legal Process
----------------------

Consistent with the applicable laws, regulations, terms and our Privacy & Cookie Policy, Temu will not produce information pertaining to merchandise partners or customers without a valid legal and binding process (such as a court order, search warrant or subpoena) properly served.

The legal process must include identifying information of accounts, such as name, email address, phone number, and/or transaction ID. Without this information, Temu may not be able to locate the account.

Temu reserves the right to object to law enforcement’s requests that are overbroad, vague (unclear), or that seek certain highly personal information, which requires a court-signed search warrant.

Requests from Law Enforcement Requiring Non-Domestic Records
------------------------------------------------------------

Requests from law enforcement requiring non-domestic records should be issued pursuant to applicable laws. Countries that have entered into Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) should follow the MLAT request process, while all other countries must follow the Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) process or provide letters rogatory unless other approved channels are available. We will not produce customer data or merchandise partner data in response to a request from law enforcement requiring records outside its jurisdiction, except in limited circumstances, such as emergency disclosures, which are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Emergency Disclosures
---------------------

If Temu has a good faith belief that an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure without delay of communications or records relating to the emergency, Temu may provide such information to law enforcement. Temu reserves the right to assess whether such requests are urgent and deserve to be prioritized.

Requests for Testimony
----------------------

All information and records from Temu are self-authenticating, and Temu reserves the right to object to subpoenas seeking testimony from Temu records custodians.

Cost Reimbursement
------------------

Temu may seek reimbursement for to cost of responding to information requests from law enforcement and legal entities, especially where the requests are burdensome.
