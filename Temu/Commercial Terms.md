FAQs

What is the Temu Ad Library?

The Temu Ad Library is a tool that provides users access to advertisements published on our European Union (EU) sites during their active publication period and for up to one year following their final presentation period on the platform. Searches can be filtered by date, country, keywords, advertiser names, name of the person who paid for the advertisement, product category, and product name.

Do I need to log in to access the Temu Ad Library?

No. The Ad Library is publicly accessible and searchable.

How to search in the Temu Ad Library?

First, choose the "Country" and "Ad publication period". Then, enter the advertiser name or keyword to search for ads that match your search query.

If you are unable to find a specific ad, it may be due to the following reasons:

1) The ad was not run on Temu.

2) Data refresh delay. Ads may take up to 48 hours to appear in the ad library after their first run.

3) Browser extension interference. Ad-blocking extensions can prevent ads from displaying. Try disabling such extensions and search again.

What is "Country"?

"Country" refers to the Temu country site where the ad has been presented.

Who is the "Advertiser"?

The "Advertiser" is the natural or legal person on whose behalf the advertisement is presented.

Who is the "Who paid for this ad"?

The natural or legal person who paid for this ad.

What does "First Shown" and "Last Shown" mean?

"First Shown" refers to the date that an ad was first presented on a Temu site. "Last Shown" refers to the date that an ad received its most recently dated impression on a Temu site.

What is "Impressions"?

A product may be promoted in multiple sites (countries), with a separate ad page created and displayed for each European country covered by the Temu Ad Library. Accordingly, the impressions shown on each ad page refer to the total number of recipients reached in that specific country.

Why some ads are removed and only display limited information？

Advertisements that are deemed non-compliant with applicable legal requirements and/or Temu policies will be removed. Pursuant to the Digital Services Act (“DSA”), only limited information is displayed for such ads in the Ad Library to comply with transparency obligations.

Which timezone does the Ad Library reflect?

All dates in the Ad Library are recorded in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

What is the Temu Ad Library API?

The Temu Ad Library Application Programming Interface (API) is designed to empower users with seamless programmatic access to ad data stored on the platform. It enables users to extract customized information for ad analysis while ensuring compliance with the ad transparency outlined in Article 39 of the EU Digital Services Act (DSA).

Is the ad information in the Ad Library and API updated regularly?

Yes, the data is updated daily. Normally, It may take up to 48 hours for an ad to appear in the ad Library from the time it have been created, and any changes or updates made to the ad will also be reflected in the ad Library within 48 hours.
