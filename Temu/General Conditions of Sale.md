Temu | Return and Refund Policy
===============================

Last Updated: Aug 27, 2025 PDT

If you are not satisfied with what you bought on Temu, you may be eligible to return it and get a refund by following the simple procedure set out in this Return and Refund Policy.

1\. How do I make a return?

![](https://aimg.kwcdn.com/upload_aimg/after_sales/47b6826e-fba3-4a48-a660-4b4c21b55548.png?imageView2/q/70/format/avif)

You can make a return by following these steps:

I. Please go to your Temu account on Temu.com or on the app to request a refund. If you do not have a Temu account, please click on "Save your Order" in your Temu order email to make a return.

II. Find the relevant order in "Your Orders" and click on the "Return/Refund" button.

III. Select the items you would like to return and the reason for the return. Depending on the reason you selected, you may be required to provide further information related to the order. After you provide the required information, click the "Next Step" button to proceed.

IV. If there is no need to return your items, then your final step is simply to select your refund method. You may choose to receive your refund as a Temu credit balance or be credited back via your original payment method. Make your selection and click "Submit".

V. If you need to return your items, you will have the option to choose your return and refund methods. After you submit the request, we will provide you with a return label so that you can return the items. Return shipping is free on your first return of one or multiple returnable items for EVERY order within 90 days from the date of purchase with some exceptions. Pickup return method may charge for an additional fee.

VI. Please place all returned items into one package and use the return label we provided to send it. The original barcode for each item should also be included.

If you cannot find it:

Please use transparent bags to individually package items without barcodes before placing them in the return package.

After the warehouse receives the items and they pass quality inspection, the refund will be issued.

If you do not receive the refund afterwards, please contact us for further assistance.

Please make sure to keep the barcode of each item in your next purchase so that you can receive your refund smoothly.

VII. After placing all the return items in one package, please print and tape the return label we provided onto the outside of the package. Send your package back from the nearest USPS/UPS location and you're done!

VIII. You can check the refund status of your items on your order details page or through Temu's SMS/Email/Push notifications.

Start return

Please make sure your return package is postmarked within 14 days after you submit your return, otherwise the return process will be terminated. The return label we provide only works if you are shipping within the United States (security-restricted areas such as military bases excluded).

2\. Is the return shipping free?

Return shipping is free on your first return of one or multiple returnable items for EVERY order within the return window. Pickup return method may charge for an additional fee.

If you need to return an oversized or overweight item or return items from a remote area you may have to send the items back by yourself. You need to pay the shipping cost in advance, and then contact us for reimbursement. After the items have been returned and have passed quality inspection, we will reimburse you.

If you have already returned items from an order and would like to return additional items from that same order, you can still do so as long as the return window has not closed.

We recommend that you try to send back your return items in one shipment to avoid paying additional fees.

For the second and subsequent refunds from the same order, you can use the return label we provide. The shipping fee of $7.99 plus tax depending on the shipping address of the order will be deducted from your refund. The tax will be added once you have applied for the refund.

3\. Where can I find the return label after applying?

You can find your return label in two different locations in "Your Orders"

Click on "All Orders"→"Print your return label and start return"→click on "Print return label"

You may also click "Returns"→"Print return label"→to download and print your return label.

4\. How long do I have before making a return?

You can return items within 90 days of purchase, with some exceptions:

I. Items that can't be returned:

Clothing items that have been worn, washed, or damaged after delivery, or have had their tags or hygiene stickers removed.

Grocery and food products.

Some health and personal care items.

Some free gifts.

Some customized products.

Some underwear orders.

Sellers may indicate that certain items are not eligible for returns, subject to Temu Return and Refund Policy. Please check product detail pages for more information.

II. The return window for most electronics is 45, 60, or 90 days from the date of purchase depending on the seller.

If an item is eligible for a return and refund, you may return it within the return window. You must send your return package back within 14 days of submitting your return request. You cannot return items after the return window has closed.

5\. Refunds

I. You may receive an advance refund, where we will issue the refund after you dropped off your return package. If the items were not returned or the returned items do not pass quality inspection, we may charge your original payment method. The advance refund will be granted based on your shopping history and at our sole discretion.

II. You may receive an instant refund, where we will issue the refund before you have returned the items. If the items were not returned or the returned items do not pass quality inspection, we may charge your original payment method. The instant refund will be granted based on your shopping history and at our sole discretion.

III. For refunds of returned items, we will process your refund after the items are received and pass quality inspection.

IV. If the returned item is used or damaged, has missing parts/accessories, or damaged due to improper packaging during return shipping, and this is not due to Temu or the seller, the refund will be reduced to compensate for the lost value of the item.

iPhone refund instructions:

The iPhone should be returned in new, unused, and unactivated condition with all original accessories and product packaging.

If the iPhone arrived damaged or malfunctioning, and it is confirmed not to be due to the user's actions, a full refund will be issued.

If the iPhone shows signs of use, is damaged, or is missing parts or accessories, not due to Temu's or the seller's error, the refund will be adjusted based on the quality inspection.

The returned iPhone must match the original order's serial number. Mismatching serial numbers will result in a denied refund request.

Note: Please ensure that all personal information is completely deleted from the device before returning it.

V. Refunds of missing items: Find the corresponding order in the support center, then select "missing item/parts" to apply for a refund, or contact customer service/the seller for help.

VI. Refunds of a package showing as delivered but not received: Find the corresponding order in the support center, then select "package shows delivered but not received" to apply for a refund, or contact customer service/the seller for help.

VII. Depending on your financial institution, refunds can take 5-14 business days (up to 30 days) to be credited to your original payment account. The original shipping fee and import tax are not refundable if your return is not a result of Temu's or the seller's fault. The insurance costs, if any, are also non-refundable. The sign on delivery fee, if any, is not refundable if the items have been delivered successfully.

VIII. You can choose to accept Temu credits instead of a refund to the original payment method.

Refunds to Temu credits are faster than your original payment method.

Temu credits have no expiration date.

Refunds to Temu credit typically cannot be reversed once they are processed.

Typically, Temu credits cannot be redeemed for cash and can only be used for purchases on Temu.

For more information about Temu credits, please visit: About credit balance.

6\. Refund timeline

Once the refund is processed, your financial institution will need additional time to have it reflected in your account. Refer to the following table for more details.

7\. Important Notice

I. The address attached to your package is NOT the return address you should use. If you send the return package to any other address, the processing time for your return may be delayed. You should send the return package to the address on the return label provided with your purchase.

II. Please make sure that you do NOT accidentally include any items in your return package that you do not wish to return. If you have accidentally included a wrong item, please contact Customer Service. We cannot promise that wrong items will be found and returned and we do not store or provide refunds or compensation for such items.

If you have any questions regarding returns or this policy:

For local warehouse items: please reach out to the seller by navigating to "Return Details" and selecting "Contact the seller".

For all other items: please contact our customer service.

Temu | Shipping Info
====================

Shipping options
----------------

You may choose standard shipping or express shipping depending on the items in your order and your location. As your orders may be handed over to local carriers for the final leg of delivery, tracking may not be available every step of the way.

Shipping address
----------------

Please make sure that you have provided the correct and current address for shipping and delivery. You may use P.O. boxes as your shipping address. But certain items can only be delivered to physical addresses. Large products, valuables, perishables, products with age-based restrictions, or items shipped via private carriers may require a physical mailing address or signature confirmation to be successfully delivered. Merchandise partners may also indicate in the product listings that they are unable to ship products to P.O. boxes. Items cannot be delivered to security-restricted areas such as military bases.

Shipping time and cost
----------------------

After an order has been successfully paid and confirmed, you will see the delivery time and cost for shipping on your order confirmation page. You will also receive an order confirmation message that will outline the processing time for your order.

It may take 1-3 days to process your order. You will receive a message once your order has been shipped.

You'll receive a shipment notification message that will provide you with the delivery time for each package once it is shipped. You will be provided with the tracking number when it is ready. You can view this delivery time under each package in your order history at the same time.

In most cases, your order will be delivered within the time of delivery. However, the actual delivery date may be affected by flight arrangements, weather conditions, and other external factors. Please refer to the tracking information for the most up to date delivery date.

Issues regarding delivery
-------------------------

If your package has not been delivered or your tracking information shows that your package has been delivered but you have not received it, please contact our customer service immediately and within 90 days of the order date.
