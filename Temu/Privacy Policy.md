---------------------------------------

We use the personal information that we collect for various purposes, including to develop, improve, support, and provide the Service, allowing you to use its features while fulfilling and enforcing our [Terms of Use](https://www.temu.com/terms-of-use.html).

How and Why We Share Your Information


-----------------------------------------

At Temu, we care deeply about privacy. While Temu shares your personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising, which may be considered a “sale” under applicable U.S. state privacy laws (as described further in the [Privacy Policy Addendum for U.S. Residents](https://www.temu.com/privacy-policy-addendum-for-us-residents.html)), Temu does not “sell” personal information in the traditional sense. We may share your personal information with the following parties for the purposes outlined below:

**Affiliates**

As a global company, our Service is supported by entities within our corporate group. We share some of your personal information with Temu subsidiaries and affiliates as necessary to provide organizational, technical, legal and compliance support for the Service, including for the purposes of order fulfilment, and other core platform functions. Such personal information includes shipping address, and contact information. These subsidiaries and affiliates either follow the same practices described in this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.

**Service providers**

We share your personal information with third parties who provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Service or our business (e.g., hosting, information technology, customer support, content delivery, email delivery, order fulfillment and delivery, marketing, fraud detection, security and website analytics). These third-party service providers only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions and services, and we require these service providers to use personal information only as necessary to perform their services or comply with applicable legal obligations.

**Payment processors**

We share your personal information with our payment processors to complete payments, process disputes, and/or process refunds.

**Advertising and analytics partners**

We may share your personal information with third-party advertising, marketing, and analytics companies for the interest-based advertising and analytics purposes described in our [Cookies and Similar Technologies Policy](https://www.temu.com/cookie-and-similar-technologies-policy.html). Certain of these disclosures to third parties are known as “sharing” or processing your personal information for targeted advertising, but “sharing” may be considered “selling” your personal information under applicable laws. For additional information and to learn about your right to opt out of such practices, see the "[Your Rights and Choices](#your_rights_and_choices)" section, the [Privacy Policy Addendum for U.S. Residents](https://www.temu.com/privacy-policy-addendum-for-us-residents.html), and the [Cookies and Similar Technologies Policy](https://www.temu.com/cookie-and-similar-technologies-policy.html).

**Third parties designated by you**

We may share your personal information with third parties where you have instructed us or provided your consent to do so. We may share the personal information required for the services you request with third parties designated by you, for example, where you choose to share a link to a Temu product listing via a third-party social media service. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services.

**Business and marketing partners**

We may share your personal information with third parties with whom we collaborate in order to offer or promote the Service. For example, depending on your communication preferences, we may share your personal information with third-party service providers with whom we have partnered in order to send you marketing communications, for example via text messages and/or emails.

**Professional advisors, U.S. public authorities, institutions, and regulators**

We may share your personal information with our professional advisors (e.g., lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers); U.S. public authorities, such as law enforcement authorities in response to legal processes (e.g., responding to subpoenas or requests from U.S. law enforcement requests); and with other parties (e.g., financial institutions) in order to enforce our agreements or policies, protect the rights, property and safety of Temu, users and others, and to detect, prevent and address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Temu's [Terms of Use](https://www.temu.com/terms-of-use.html), other illegal activities, security issues or when it is required by law.

**Business transferees**

In the rare event of a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or reorganization, we may share some of your personal information with relevant parties (e.g., a buyer or successor) in order to facilitate such a transaction. If we intend to transfer information about you, we will inform you either by email or by posting a notice on the Service.

**Merchandise partners**

We may share your personal information with the merchandise partners related to the product reviews you leave, the return or refund reasons you request a return or refund, and customization information for customized/personalized items. To fulfill your order, we may share with the merchandise partner your name, shipping address, contact information, communications with our customer support functions, and your order information, for example, to address a query or complaint, or when the merchandise partner connects directly with logistics service providers. The merchandise partner will not receive your payment information or device data.

**Other users**

Please note that, in using our Service, your personal information may be visible to other users. In accordance with your settings and preferences, we may display your profile photo and/or username to other users, including when you participate in a promotion or marketing program (e.g., referring friends to our Service and accepting invitations from other users), when you review or rate a product, or when you add a product to your cart or purchase a product.

We generally retain personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, as well as for the purposes of satisfying any applicable U.S. legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.

The Sale and Sharing of Personal Information


------------------------------------------------

Temu uses services that employ cookies and similar technologies to collect Personal Information (including certain identifiers and internet activity information described in the “[Collection of Personal Information](#collection_of_personal_information)” section above) about your use of our websites and other online services over time, which helps us to deliver targeted advertisements. In addition, we may share certain categories of Personal Information described in the table of the “[Processing of Personal Information](#processing_of_personal_information)” section with our advertising and analytics partners, as well as business and marketing partners with whom we collaborate on marketing events and/or promotion of the Service for targeted advertising purposes. For example, we may share identifiers including your email address and telephone number with our advertising and analytics partners (in hashed form) and business and marketing partners. Our use of some of these services may constitute the “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information (as defined by the applicable U.S. state privacy laws) to/with third party advertisers. We do not knowingly sell or share (as defined by the applicable U.S. state privacy laws) the Personal Information of minors under 16 years of age.

Your Privacy Rights


-----------------------

Depending on the state you live in, you may have some or all of the rights listed below and any additional rights granted by applicable U.S. state law in relation to Personal Information that we have collected about you. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.

*   **Right to Know / Access.** The right to request information about the categories of Personal Information we collect, the categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information, the purposes for which we process Personal Information, the categories of third parties, or a list of specific third parties, to whom we disclose your Personal Information, and a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you.
    

*   **Right to Delete.** The right to request that we delete Personal Information we maintain about you.
    

*   **Right to Correct.** The right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we maintain about you.
    

*   **Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing.** The right to opt out of selling your Personal Information and sharing your Personal Information for targeted advertising.
    

*   **Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising.** The right to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for the purposes of targeted advertising.
    

*   **Right to Opt Out of Profiling.** The right to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer. However, Temu does not engage in such profiling as defined by applicable U.S. state laws.
    

You may exercise these rights via our privacy choices [web form](https://www.temu.com/bgp-privacy-policy-and-setting.html) or by contacting us using the contact information provided in the “[How to Contact Us](#how_to_contact_us)” section below. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. For certain rights, we may need to collect information from you to verify your identity before providing a substantive response to the request. Depending on your location, you may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney document, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. In the event that your request is denied, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to these rights by contacting us using the email provided in the “[How to Contact Us](#how_to_contact_us)” section below.

You may also be able to set your browser to transmit a “global privacy control” (“GPC”) signal or another approved “universal opt-out mechanism” to opt out of “selling” and “targeted advertising” (as defined by applicable U.S. state law). If you notify us of your preference through GPC, we will honor your request for the browser or device that sends the GPC signal. If you do not have an account or are not logged into your account, your request to opt out through the GPC will not apply to any account information. Please note that if you return to our website from a different device, or from a different browser on the same device, you may need to apply the GPC or other signal for that browser and/or device as well. To learn more about GPC, you can visit [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

Additionally, some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals.

For the latest details of the privacy right requests we received and processed in the United States, please click [here](https://www.temu.com/metrics-disclosure.html).

Sensitive Personal Information


----------------------------------

Temu neither uses nor discloses Sensitive Personal Information (as defined by the CCPA) for purposes other than those expressly permitted under California Civil Code § 1798.121 and California Code of Regulations § 7027(m). For example, Temu does not collect or process your Sensitive Personal Information to infer characteristics about you.

Notice of Financial Incentive


---------------------------------

We may offer certain promotions, such as our referral programs, where you can refer friends to earn rewards. These promotions provide certain perks, including rewards, exclusive offers, sweepstakes, contests, or other similar promotional campaigns.

When you participate in these promotions and use our services, you may need to provide contact information (such as email address, telephone number, or third-party login information). Since the above process involves the collection of Personal Information and offering of certain benefits, we might be considered to be offering a “financial incentive” (as such term is defined by applicable Californian law) in California. We have not assigned a monetary value to the data we collect through or in connection with the above promotions; however, based on our good faith reasonable estimate, the value we receive from your Personal Information is reasonably related to the value of the “financial incentive” we provide to individuals who participate in these promotions.

To withdraw from referral programs, you may stop participating or email us at privacy@temu.com.

How to Contact Us


---------------------

Should you have any questions about our privacy practices or this U.S. Notice, please email us at [privacy@temu.com](mailto:privacy@temu.com) or contact us by mail at the following address: Whaleco Inc., Suite 355, 31 St. James Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, USA.

Temu | U.S. | Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy
=================================================

Last Updated: November 14, 2025

This Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy provides information regarding how Whaleco Inc. ("Temu," "we," "our," or "us") processes "consumer health data" as defined by applicable consumer health privacy laws. In the event of a conflict between Temu's [Privacy Policy](https://www.temu.com/privacy-and-cookie-policy.html) and this Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy, this Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy will control with respect to the processing of consumer health data.

What Consumer Health Data Do We Collect


-------------------------------------------

We collect consumer health data in connection with certain of our services. The type(s) of consumer health data we may collect depends on your interactions with us. For example, we may collect information you provide about your health, health care services, tests, reports, medications, or invoices when you submit a customer service request or complaint related to your health, including photographs and customer support calls that may be recorded related to your health conditions, which may be considered biometric data under certain laws although we do not extract any identifier template(s) from this data.

How and Why We Use Your Consumer Health Data


------------------------------------------------

We may use consumer health data as necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested or authorized. This may include order processing and fulfillment, communicating with you regarding orders, products, and services, providing you with customer support services, optimizing features, fixing errors, and improving our services and our business.

We may also use your consumer health data for compliance purposes and to prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to fraud, violations of our [Terms of Use](https://www.temu.com/terms-of-use.html) and policies, or other misconduct.

We may deidentify consumer health data so that it cannot reasonably be reidentified by us or by another person. If we deidentify information that was originally based on consumer health data, we maintain and use that information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the data, except as otherwise permitted under applicable law and for the purposes described in this policy.

How and Why We Disclose Your Consumer Health Data


-----------------------------------------------------

We may disclose the consumer health data described in this Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy as necessary to provide you with a service you request, to comply with our legal obligations, or for certain security-related purposes, as described above. We may also disclose consumer health data with:

### 

Service providers

Third parties that provide services on our behalf or help us operate our services or our business (such as customer support). These third-party service providers have access to only the consumer health data needed to perform their functions and services but shall not use such data for other purposes. Some of these service providers may be Temu affiliates.

### 

Professional advisors, authorities, and regulators

We may disclose your consumer health data to our professional advisors (e.g., lawyers, auditors, bankers, and insurers), in response to legal processes (e.g., responding to subpoenas or requests from U.S. government or law enforcement authorities), and with other parties in order to enforce our agreements or policies, protect the rights, property and safety of Temu, users and others, and to detect, prevent and address actual or suspected fraud, violations of Temu's [Terms of Use](https://www.temu.com/terms-of-use.html), other illegal activities, security issues, or when it is required by law.

### 

Business transferees

We may disclose your consumer health data to acquirers and other relevant participants in the rare event of business transactions such as a merger, acquisition, or reorganization. If Temu intends to transfer information about you, Temu will inform you by email or by putting up a notice on the Temu app and on Temu.com.

### 

Third parties designated by you

We may disclose your consumer health data to third parties where you have instructed us. For example, to process your request, you may be asked to direct us to share information related to your reported injury with our merchandise partners. Please be assured that we will not share any personal information beyond what you have authorized. We may disclose the consumer health data required for the products or services you request to third parties designated by you.

Your Controls and Choices


-----------------------------

Under applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your consumer health data, including the right to access or delete your consumer health data. You may exercise these rights by submitting a request via our privacy choices [web form](https://www.temu.com/bgp-additional-privacy-options.html) or by contacting us using the information provided below. We will use information you provide in your request to verify your identity, and we may request additional information if necessary to complete the verification process.

If your request to exercise a right under applicable law is denied, you may appeal that decision by contacting us as described below. If you have questions or would like to communicate with us about this Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy@temu.com or contact us by mail at the following address:
