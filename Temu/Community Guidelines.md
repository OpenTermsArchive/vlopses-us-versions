How we keep reviews trustworthy and useful?

To ensure only real customers post reviews, we have submission requirements. Customers who have purchased items on Temu are eligible to submit ratings and reviews for the items they have purchased.

Before posting a review, we check if it meets our [Community Guidelines](https://www.temu.com/community-guidelines.html).

We listen to our customers. If you think a review violates our guidelines, you can report the review and we'll investigate it.

How we calculate overall star ratings?

The overall star rating reflects the average of all valid ratings submitted by customers. A star rating may be excluded from the average if its review violates Temu's Review guidelines.

What are our review guidelines?

When you write reviews about Temu or items sold on Temu, you should:

1\. Be truthful.

Your review, including words, photos, and other materials, should be about your own experience on Temu or about a product sold on Temu. Your review should not mislead viewers about any feature, function, or quality of a product.
