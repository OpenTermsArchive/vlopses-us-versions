How we keep reviews trustworthy and useful?

To ensure only real customers post reviews, we have submission requirements. Customers who have purchased items on Temu are eligible to submit ratings and reviews for the items they have purchased.

Before posting a review, we check if it meets our [Community Guidelines](https://www.temu.com/community-guidelines.html).

We listen to our customers. If you think a review violates our guidelines, you can report the review and we'll investigate it.

How we calculate overall star ratings?

The overall star rating reflects the average of all valid ratings submitted by customers. A star rating may be excluded from the average if its review violates Temu's Review guidelines.

What are our review guidelines?

When you write reviews about Temu or items sold on Temu, you should:

1\. Be truthful.

Your review, including words, photos, and other materials, should be about your own experience on Temu or about a product sold on Temu. Your review should not mislead viewers about any feature, function, or quality of a product.

2\. Be respectful.

Your review should not contain anything that is obscene, libelous, hateful, violent, offensive, illegal, sexually explicit, or otherwise inappropriate.

3\. Respect intellectual property rights.

Your review should not contain any material that you do not have permission to use or infringes on any intellectual property of any third party.

4\. Use product as intended.

Your review should be about using a product as intended by the manufacturer. Your review should not depict a product being used in an unintended manner, especially in any unsafe or illegal manner.

5\. Be mindful of privacy.

Your review should not contain personal information of your own or a third party, including phone numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, etc.

6\. Do not mention competitors.

Your review should not compare products or services of other competitors by name.

7\. Do not mention promotional codes.

Your review should not contain any information about promotional codes or invitation codes.

For more details, please visit our [Community Guidelines](https://www.temu.com/community-guidelines.html).

How long are reviews displayed?

As long as the review meets the review guidelines and [Community Guidelines](https://www.temu.com/community-guidelines.html), and the item is currently available, the review will be displayed.

Are sponsored or influenced reviews allowed on Temu?

Traders are not allowed to sponsor or influence reviews posted on Temu.

Temu Community Guidelines
=========================

The purpose of these Temu Community Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) is to ensure a beneficial experience for all Temu users. The Guidelines address appropriate content and behavior in spaces and forums accessible by other Temu users. The Guidelines form part of the Temu [Terms of Use](https://www.temu.com/terms-of-use.html).

The Temu community features for which these Guidelines apply include, without limitation, reviews, helpful votes, wishlists and other lists, profile pages, customized products, and review violation reports. The Guidelines apply to your interactions with other Temu users and other actions you take, such as sharing photos, videos, links, text, and indications of approval such as star ratings.

**You agree not to participate in the following conduct in connection with your use of Temu Services:**

1\. Unethical Conduct
---------------------

Your review, including words, photos, and other materials, should be an honest account of your own experience on Temu or about a product sold on Temu and it should not mislead viewers about any feature, function, or quality of a product. Your review should be about using a product as intended by the manufacturer - please do not depict a product being used in an unintended manner, especially in any unsafe or illegal manner.

2\. Distracting content and spam
--------------------------------

Comments that include distracting content or spam, such as repetitive text, nonsense and gibberish, repetitive punctuation and symbols, and ASCII art (pictures created using symbols and letters) are not permitted.

3\. Private information
-----------------------

Content that invades others' privacy or shares your own personal information, such as phone number, email address, mailing address, license plate, or order number is not permitted.

4\. Objectionable content
-------------------------

The following content categories are prohibited: profanity, obscenities, name-calling or otherwise offensive, objectionable or abusive content; harassment or threats; attacks on people you disagree with; libel, defamation, or inflammatory content; drowning out others' opinions by posting from multiple accounts, coordinating with others, or otherwise. Content which is clearly unrelated to the Services (e.g., politics, religion, war) may also be considered objectionable.

5\. Hate speech and discrimination
----------------------------------

Expressions of hatred for people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, age, or disability or otherwise discriminatory content is not permitted. We also do not permit promotions of organizations that use such hate speech.

It is acceptable to discuss sex and sensuality products and products with sexual content sold on the Services. However, profanity and obscene language are not permitted. We do not allow content with nudity or sexually explicit images or descriptions.

7\. External links

Content that aims to promote a company, website, author, or special offer is not permitted.

9\. Conflicts of interest
-------------------------

Content about your own products or services, or products or services offered by your friends, relatives, employers, business associates, or competitors are not permitted.

10\. Requests must be made neutrally
------------------------------------

If you request that others post content about your products, the request must be neutral. Do not try to influence others to leave a positive rating or review. Do not offer, request, or accept compensation of any kind for creating, editing, or posting content. If you have a close financial or personal relationship with a merchandise partner, you must clearly disclose that relationship if you post content about that merchandise partner.

11\. Plagiarism, infringement, or impersonation
-----------------------------------------------

Do not post content unless you have the necessary rights or permission to use it on the Services. Content or interactions that infringe on any person’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights is not permitted. We do not allow impersonations of individuals or organizations. Users can also refer to the Temu [Intellectual Property Policy](https://www.temu.com/intellectual-property-policy.html).

Content that constitutes or encourages violence or any illegal activity, such as illegal drug use, underage drinking, or child or animal abuse is not permitted. You must not engage in any harmful conduct when using the Services. Content that advocates or threatens physical or financial harm to yourself or others, including acts of terrorism, is not permitted. Jokes or sarcastic comments about causing harm are not permitted. You must not engage in any misleading, false, fraudulent, or deceptive conduct when using the Services. Offers of fraudulent goods, services, promotions, or schemes such as make money fast or pyramid schemes are not permitted. You may not encourage the dangerous misuse of a product.
