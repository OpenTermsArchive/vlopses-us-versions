INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE

1\. Notice Requirements

As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by SHEIN violates your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please submit your complaint through our online intellectual property complaint portal: [m.shein.com/us/ip-complaint](https://m.shein.com/us/ip-complaint) . Any such notice must include the following information:

*   A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the intellectual property right that has been allegedly infringed.
*   Identification of intellectual property being infringed, including, if any, the corresponding registration number and corresponding country of registration.
*   Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including information regarding the location of the infringing materials on the Site or App, with sufficient detail so that SHEIN can find it.
*   If a design patent is at issue, identify the design patent that you claim has been infringed along with the registration number.
*   If a utility patent is at issue, identify the utility patent that you claim has been infringed along with a Court Order or Judgment supporting your claim.
*   Your full legal name, company affiliation (if any), mailing address, telephone number, and email address.
*   A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the allegedly infringing material is not authorized by the intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law.
*   A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the intellectual property owner’s behalf.

Alternatively, you may send a notice of claimed infringement with the foregoing information to us\_legal@sheingroup.com with the subject “Takedown Request” or to the following address:

*   Copyright Agent, Legal Department
*   SHEIN US Services, LLC
*   777 S. Alameda St., 2nd Floor
*   Los Angeles, CA 90021-1672

Upon receipt of such notices, we reserve the right to remove or disable access to the material or disable any links to the material; notify the party accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and terminate access to and use of SHEIN services for any user or third-party seller who repeatedly infringes the intellectual property rights of SHEIN or others, or as otherwise stated in our Terms of Use or policies.

2\. Counter Notice Requirements

If you believe that material you posted on SHEIN was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated above. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), your notice must include substantially the following:

*   Your physical or electronic signature.
*   An identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled.
*   Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address).
*   A statement under penalty of perjury by you that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
*   A statement that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if you reside outside the United States for any judicial district in which the Services may be found) and that you will accept service from the person (or an agent of that person) who provided SHEIN with the complaint at issue.

The removed material may be replaced or access to it may be restored 10 to 14 business days after the counter notice is processed unless the party claiming infringement files a lawsuit against you. Please be aware that if you misrepresent that material is not infringing, you may be liable for damages or penalties (including costs and attorneys' fees). SHEIN reserves the right to reject any counter notifications filed in bad faith.

SHEIN Global Marketplace Policy: Anti-Counterfeiting & Intellectual Property Infringement Policy

05/08/2024 | SHEIN Seller Adminis

  

   At SHEIN, we take customer trust extremely seriously and always strive to provide the best customer experience. **Therefore, products offered for sale on all of the SHEIN Marketplaces must be authentic. The sale of counterfeit products on any of the SHEIN Marketplaces is strictly prohibited. Failure to abide by this policy may result in actions against your account, such as suspension or termination of your SHEIN Marketplace account, cancellation of listings, suspension or forfeiture of payments, removal of selling privileges, and disposal of inventory if they are in our possession.**

  

   It is each seller’s responsibility to source, sell, and fulfill only authentic products. Prohibited products include bootlegs, fakes, or pirated copies of products; products that have been illegally replicated, reproduced, or manufactured; and products that infringe another party’s intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks and design rights. In addition, we may pause remittance to you if we suspect that a SHEIN Marketplace account has been used to sell inauthentic goods, commit fraud, or engage in other illegal activity, until we can investigate and verify.

  

   We work with a variety of stakeholders and rightsholders to detect and prevent inauthentic or otherwise infringing products from reaching our customers. As a result, we reserve the right to remove suspect listings based on our own review of listings in our discretion. We also work with rightsholders and law enforcement worldwide to take and support legal action against sellers and suppliers that knowingly violate this policy and harm our customers. In addition to criminal fines and imprisonment, sellers and suppliers of inauthentic products may face civil penalties including the loss of any amounts received from the sale of inauthentic products, the damage or harm sustained by the rightsholders, statutory and other damages, and attorney’s fees.

  

   SHEIN strives to ensure a trustworthy shopping experience for our customers. By selling on any of the SHEIN Marketplaces, you acknowledge and agree that:

   · The sale of counterfeit products is strictly prohibited;

   · You may not sell any products that are not legal, such as products that have been illegally replicated, reproduced, or manufactured, or that bear the trademarks, service marks, names or logos of third parties to which you have not  been licensed;

   · You must provide records about the authenticity or originality of your products if SHEIN requests that documentation.
