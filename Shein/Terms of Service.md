**5.6 Release for Disputes with Third-Party Sellers.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, SHEIN expressly disclaims any and all liability that may arise between you and any Third-Party Seller. The Services merely provide a venue for connecting our users with Third-Party Sellers.

**13.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and SHEIN agree that any dispute, claim, disagreement arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Site, App, Services or the Agreement and prior versions of the Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of this Agreement (each a **“Dispute”** ), will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you and SHEIN may assert claims or seek relief in a small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you and SHEIN may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).

**13.2 Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND SHEIN HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and SHEIN are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the paragraph entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.

**13.3 Class Action Waiver.** YOU AND SHEIN AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “BATCH ARBITRATION” BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. To the extent permissible by law, there shall be no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated as a representative action or as a private attorney general action, including but not limited to claims brought pursuant to the Private Attorney General Act of 2004, Cal. Lab. Code § 2698, et seq. This means that you may not seek relief on behalf of any other parties in arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this paragraph, “Class Action Waiver” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and SHEIN agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the courts indicated in paragraph 13.11 below. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This paragraph does not prevent you or SHEIN from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

**13.4 Informal Dispute Resolution.** You and SHEIN agree to try to resolve any Dispute informally before resorting to arbitration. You and SHEIN therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement ( **“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”** ). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference ( **“Notice”** ), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to SHEIN that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to [us\_legal@sheingroup.com](mailto:us_legal@sheingroup.com) or regular mail to Paracorp, 2140 S. DuPont Hwy Camden, DE 19934. Notice to you will be sent to the address or email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.

**13.5 Arbitration Procedures.** You and SHEIN agree that this Arbitration Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., applies. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and SHEIN agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other Disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. Any arbitration of a Dispute relating to your access to or use of the Site, the App, or Services, any products sold or distributed through the Site or the App primarily for personal, family or household purposes shall also be subject to the allocation of arbitration costs and other requirements of the JAMS’ policy regarding Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness available at https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable JAMS Arbitration Rules. If there is a conflict between the JAMS rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.

**13.6** A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the **“Request”** ). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. To initiate arbitration, you must send the Request to Paracorp, 2140 S. DuPont Hwy Camden, DE 19934. If we initiate arbitration, we will send the Request to the address or email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Unless you and SHEIN otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed below is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.

**13.7 Batch Arbitration.** To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and SHEIN agree that in the event that there are twenty five (25) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against SHEIN by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award ( **“Batch Arbitration”** ). All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process ( **“Administrative Arbitrator”** ). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by SHEIN. You and SHEIN agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.

**13.8 Authority of Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the paragraph entitled “Class Action Waiver,” including any claim that that same paragraph is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the paragraph entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction

**13.9 30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to us\_legal@sheingroup.com within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us. If the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the courts indicated in paragraph 13.11 below.

**13.10 Invalidity, Expiration.** Except as provided in the paragraph entitled “Class Action Waiver”, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with SHEIN as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.

**13.11 Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if SHEIN makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to SHEIN at Paracorp, 2140 S. DuPont Hwy Camden, DE 19934, your continued use of the Site, the App and/or Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Site or App following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the Site or the App, or these Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. SHEIN will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.

**13.12 Governing Courts.** To the extent that the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the state or federal courts located in Delaware (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside).

No waiver of any term of the Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. Our failure to assert any right or provision under the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**14.10 Severability.** If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion must be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions must remain in full force and effect.

LEGAL DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT FOR USERS IN THE UNITED STATES

9.1 US residents should Read the Following Clauses Carefully: It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court

9.1.1 Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at [legal@shein.com](mailto:legal@shein.com) to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Site. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. Each of you and we agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

9.1.2 Agreement to Binding Arbitration. If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to the Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), your and our relationship and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. You and we shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on you and us and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of the Terms shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures. If you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250.00), we will pay the additional cost. If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS. We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration, other than costs incurred by you for legal counsel, travel and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses not constituting fees or amounts payable to JAMS. You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration. We will also pay JAMS to reimburse you for any portion of the $250 filing fee that is more than what you would otherwise have to pay to file suit in a court of law.

You and we understand that, absent this mandatory provision, you and we would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. You and we further understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

9.1.3 Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. You and we each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action, and you and we each expressly waive our respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and you and we shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

9.1.4 Exception – Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding your and our agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either you or we may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

9.1.5 California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) Action. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a court of law for a claim arising under California’s Private Attorneys General Act.

9.1.6 30-Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at [legal@shein.com](mailto:legal@shein.com). The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your agreement to the Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.

9.1.7 Exclusive Venue for Litigation. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth above do not apply or if you have opted out of arbitration, you and we agree that any litigation between you and us shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). You and we expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in California for any litigation other than small claims court actions. In the event of litigation relating to the Terms or the Services, you and we agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.
