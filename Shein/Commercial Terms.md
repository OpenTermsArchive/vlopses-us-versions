SHEIN Supplier's Undertakings of Code of Conduct



Date: ___________, 20___



To: ROADGET BUSINESS PTE.LTD. (together with its affiliates, the "Customer")



We ("supplier partner"), as a direct or indirect manufacturer or supplier of certain products, raw materials, or services

to the Customer, hereby irrevocably agree and covenant to the Customer that, during our procurement, production,

promotion, sales and disposal of such products or services, we shall comply with the minimum standards set forth in the

following Code of Conduct:



1. Legal requirements. As a supplier partner, we shall operate in full compliance with local laws, rules, governmental

orders and regulatory requirements in the countries or regions where we operate our business.



2. Employment must be voluntary. The supplier partner shall not use forced labor, including prison labor, bonded labor

or other forms of forced labor, and comply with the International Labor Organization's Conventions on forced labor

(including amendments, supplements or restatements from time to time), in their direct or indirect procurement. The

supplier partner acknowledges that the Customer does not tolerate suppliers that traffic workers or in any other way

exploit workers by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, or fraud. Subject to the applicable laws, all work must

be voluntary, and workers must be able to leave work and terminate their employment or other work status with

reasonable notice, and workers must not be required to pay recruitment, hiring, agents’ or brokers’ fees, or other

related fees for their employment either in their home country or the country where work is performed. Supplier

partner is required to bear or reimburse to their workers the cost of any such fees incurred at any point during the

recruitment process, even if outside of the suppliers’ direct control of the recruitment process. Upon the Customer's

request, all fees and expenses charged to workers must be disclosed to Customer and/or communicated to workers in

their native language in advance of employment or work.



Supplier partner must not require workers to surrender government issued identification, passports, or work permits as

a condition of working. Supplier partners may only temporarily hold onto such documents to the extent reasonably

necessary to complete legitimate administrative and immigration processing. Workers must be given clear,

understandable documentation that defines the terms and conditions of their engagement in a language and manner

understood by the workers.



Supplier partner further agrees to hold their third-party labor agents or brokers to the standards and practices covered

by this Code of Conduct.



Supplier partner shall monitor the practices of recruitment agencies and labor brokers and employ agencies that act

ethically and in the best interests of workers when contracting labor. Supplier partner shall require and use its best

efforts to ensure that staffing or recruiting agencies comply with our Code of Conduct, as well as all applicable laws of

the country where work is performed and the worker’s home country.



3. Employees must be over 16 years old. The supplier partner shall not hire minors under age 16. If the supplier partner

has any employees that are older than 16 years of age, but under 18 years of age, supplier partners shall not require

them to engage in work in any form that is harmful to the body, and must provide such employees with necessary work

protection.



4. No discrimination. The supplier partner shall not discriminate against its employees in terms of gender, race, religion,

age, disability status, sexual orientation, pregnancy status, marital status, nationality, political opinion, union affiliation,

social or ethnic background, or any other aspects, with reference to the 1998 International Labor Organization

Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, against which such discrimination is prohibited under the

applicable laws of the relevant country/region. Discrimination includes but is not limited to the establishment of any

unreasonable obstacles or restrictions in employment, salary, promotion or discipline, etc.



5. Respect for freedom of association and collective bargaining between labor and management. The supplier partner

shall respect employees’ freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining between employees and

management. Employees have the right to form and join trade unions and other workers’ organizations of their own

choosing, and they shall not be subject to any harassment, interference or retaliation for the foregoing actions.



6. Pay salary on time. The supplier partner shall pay employees’ wages on time, and the amount of wages shall not be

lower than the minimum wage required by the laws of the country/region where the supplier partner is located, and

comply with the legal requirements for overtime compensation. There shall not be disciplinary deduction from wage

payment.



7. No harassment or abuse of employees. The supplier partner shall treat employees with respect and dignity, and shall

not harass or abuse their employees physically, sexually, mentally or verbally.



8. Working hours. The supplier partner shall arrange working hours reasonably and shall comply with local laws and

regulations. Agreement between employee and supplier on working hours shall be agreed upon transparently with the

employee before starting employment.



9. Workplace health and safety. The supplier partner shall provide a safe, hygienic and healthy workplace environment,

and take necessary measures to prevent employees from accidents and injuries arising out of, or related to, work in the

course of their services.



10. Minimize impact on the environment. The supplier partner shall strictly comply with applicable laws and regulations

related to environmental protection (including but not limited to emissions, solid/hazardous waste and wastewater

emissions). The supplier partner shall adopt reasonable measures to reduce or mitigate the negative impact of their

operations on the environment, and be committed to continuous improvement, protecting the environment, and

maintaining ecological balance.



11. Audit and supervision. The supplier partner understands and agrees that, regardless of whether prior notice is given,

the Customer and its designated agent is entitled to take all reasonable and necessary measures to inspect and

supervise the supplier partner in the course of its fulfillment and performance of this Code of Conduct. Such measures

include but are not limited to interviews with employees/workers of the supplier partner, entering and accessing all of

the supplier partner’s workplace, such as the production facilities or workplaces, etc., and reviewing relevant documents

and files of the supplier partner, etc., with or without notice to the supplier partner. Upon the Customer’s request, the

supplier partner shall immediately provide corresponding certification materials according to the company's request to

prove that supplier partner has met the requirements of this Code of Conduct. The supplier partner represents and

warrants that the supporting materials provided shall be true, accurate, complete and non-misleading in terms of

proving its satisfaction of the requirements of this Code of Conduct.



12. Improvement actions. If the supplier partner is found to have violated this Code of Conduct, the Customer will have

the right but not the obligation to negotiate a remediation plan with the supplier partner to resolve the violation within

a reasonable period of time. If the supplier partner fails to remediate within a reasonable time or refuses to rectify after

receiving the remediation notice from the Customer, the Customer has the right to unilaterally cancel the order and/or

immediately terminate all business cooperation with the supplier partner, and the Customer should not, as a result of

the aforementioned cancellation of orders or termination of cooperation, be liable for any form of breach of contract,

infringement or damages. And in the event that any losses are suffered by the Customer due to the breach of this Code

of Conduct by the supplier partner, the supplier partner shall, upon the Customer's notice to the supplier partner,

indemnify and hold harmless the Customer against all losses (including any amount incurred due to the collection of

such losses). Specifically, with respect to each product produced as a result of breach of this Code of Conduct, the

supplier partner shall be liable for liquidated damages in an amount equal to three (3) times the purchase price paid by

the Customer. In addition to cancelling orders or terminating the business relationship with supplier partner, in the

event that supplier partner fails to remediate violations, Customer reserves the right to report the results of the

remediation plan with the supplier partner to regulatory authorities, industry associations, and third-party auditors.



13\. No Sub-contracting or Partial Sub-contracting. Supplier partners hereby further acknowledge to agree to and carry

out the previously made requirements and commitments in relation to sub-contracting, partial sub-contracting, and

assigning the subject matter of the cooperation: Supplier partners represent and warrant that all the products,

materials, or services are produced and/or provided by themselves and by no other. Without prior written consent of

the client, supplier partners shall not sub-contract, partially sub-contract or assign in any way the obligations outlined in

the contract or commitment document (if any) executed with the client regarding the provision of products, services,

rights and obligations to a third party (“subcontractor”). Any purported assignment shall be deemed invalid. If the client

consents to the said assignment, supplier partners shall make available to the client the name, address, and information

requested by the client pertaining to the said subcontractor promptly (not later than 5 working days after the client’s

consent). The said assignment shall only be allowed under the preconditions:



(a) Supplier partners that make efforts to ensure that the sub-contractor is without any right to further sub-

contract, partially sub-contract, or assign in any way the relevant rights or obligations, unless with the prior

written consent of the client;

(b) Supplier partners shall explicitly express to the sub-contractor and the sub-contractor shall agree that the

production or provision of all the materials, products, or services in discussion will eventually be used and

relied on by the client, to which the client may hold the sub-contractor liable;

(c) Supplier partners shall bear unlimited joint liability for all the acts of the sub-contractor and any

consequential damage and shall take the responsibility as per the contract or commitment document (if any)

previously executed with the client;

(d) Supplier partners shall, at all times, ensure the continuous compliance of the sub-contractor with the rules

set forth in this Code of Conduct by conducting an audit and supervision of the sub-contractor and providing

the audit result at the client’s request;

(e) Supplier partners shall explicitly express to the sub-contractor and the sub-contractor shall agree that the

client is entitled to carry out the aforesaid audit and supervision of the sub-contractor, to the extent of a full

scope audit and supervision campaign, to which the sub-contractor must exert all of its necessary assistance.



14\. Date of Effectiveness. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to summarize and emphasize the preconditions upon

which a legitimate and compliant cooperation with the client shall commence.



The supplier partner hereby expressly acknowledges that it has reviewed and understood the aforementioned

undertakings in this Code of Conduct, and agrees that, upon requests pursuant to laws, regulations or by regulatory

authorities, or in the Customer’s sole discretion, the Customer shall be entitled to disclose this Code of Conduct. The

supplier partner further agrees that, in order to satisfy the requirements of regulatory authorities, the supplier partner

may, upon requests of the Customer, execute additional translated versions of this Code of Conduct. And in the event of

any discrepancies between this Code of Conduct and such translated versions, the version accepted by the regulatory

authority shall prevail. This Code of Conduct, slated to take effect since the date recorded upfront, shall holistically

constitute the commitment, representation, and warrant of the undersigned made on all the matters described in this

Code of Conduct and supersede any prior discussion, description, expressed intent, understanding, or relevant

commitment, representation, and warrant, oral or written or given in any other way.

Foreword



SHEIN is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and supports The Ten Principles

focused on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. We support the UN's 17 Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs), based on which we shape our current and future development initiatives.

We respect other standards set forth by the United Nations and the International Labor Organization

(ILO), such as the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Guiding

Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Core Conventions and the ILO Declaration on

Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and are committed to operating in a responsible manner.



As the world's leading fast-fashion brand, SHEIN is well aware of our global reach, and we recognize

our responsibility to influence changes. Through this Standard, we set out requirements for our global

supply chain, to ensure the employees in the supply chain are treated with respect and dignity, and

are able to work and live in healthy, safe and comfortable places, and to ensure that Suppliers are

able to act in an environmentally responsible way in the production of products or the provision of

services for SHEIN, to minimize their impact on the environment.



In the event of any conflict between this Standard and applicable laws in the country/region where

Suppliers operate, Suppliers shall comply with the applicable laws (including, but not limited to laws,

rules, governmental orders, and regulatory requirements), and the more stringent requirement

between the two shall prevail. SHEIN encourages Suppliers to not only fully comply with applicable

laws, but also to respect the internationally recognized best practices, to seek higher ethical

standards, greater employee welfare, and more significant reductions in resource consumption and

pollution emissions.



This Standard applies to all new and existing Tier 1 Suppliers, who directly or indirectly manufacture

SHEIN branded products, sub-branded products (including ROMWE, MOTF, LUVLETTE, DAZY, CUCCOO,

EMERY ROSE, GLOWMODE, SHEGLAM, PETSIN, SLOW SUNDAY) and other products, Tier 2 Suppliers who

manufacture finished materials or components, and Service Providers, hereinafter collectively referred

to as "Suppliers".

Suppliers shall also require their own subcontractors, Suppliers, and service providers to comply with

applicable laws and this Standard, and make their adoption of this Standard a condition of

cooperation, so as to promote overall compliance in the whole SHEIN supply chain.



Note: Sub-branded products listed here are subject to change as announced on SHEIN’s website.



Purpose



Scope of Application

SHEIN Supplier Responsibility Standards

Suppliers are expected to uphold the highest level of honesty and integrity in SHEIN's supplier

admission, evaluation, and business dealings, to maintain a reliable and sustainable business

relationship with SHEIN.



Suppliers shall keep and maintain complete and accurate records that can be disclosed to SHEIN and

its designated third-party upon evaluation or other requests to demonstrate that Supplier is in

compliance with the requirements of this Standard and/or applicable laws in the areas of labor rights,

health and safety, environment, and ethics. Suppliers shall not falsify or manipulate records or make

fake or distorted statements to SHEIN and its designated third-party



Transparency and Integrity

1 Labor Rights



Suppliers shall respect the rights and benefits of employees based on applicable laws in the

countries/regions where Suppliers operate, and the international standards and norms mentioned in

this Standard. Employees referred to herein include permanent employees directly recruited by the

Suppliers, temporary workers, student workers, foreign workers, dispatched workers, outsourced

workers, and other employees recruited and hired in various ways to work in areas where Suppliers

control.



1.1 Voluntary Employment



1.1.1 Prison labor



Internationally, not all countries have legislation prohibiting the use of prison labor. SHEIN

requires that Suppliers, whether public or private, adhering to the highest standards, not

distribute production or parts of production to prisons, not use prison labor, and have a duty to

ensure and retain evidence that raw materials and components purchased by Suppliers do

not originate in prisons.

1.1.2 Bonded labor

Suppliers may allow employees to take out interest-bearing or interest-free loans or payroll

advances; however, this relationship should never be used as a reason to prevent employees

and/or their family members from leaving their jobs or receiving at least a minimum living

wage.

1.1.3 Modern slavery and human trafficking

Suppliers and their subcontractors, Suppliers, labor dispatching companies, labor outsourcing

companies, recruitment agents, and labor brokers shall never traffic, recruit, transport, harbor,

transfer, or receive persons through force, threats, coercion, abduction, or use pedigree-based

slavery, or exploit their employees through incarceration, or by not paying/paying only minimal

wages.

1.1.4 Violence, intimidation, threats, fraud

During the process of recruitment, employment and termination, Suppliers should not harm and

control over employees through violence, intimidation, threats, fraud, etc., such as using

violence to force laborers to undertake tasks that were not part of the initial agreement,

intimidating and threatening them with the loss of their jobs or denunciation to the immigration

authorities, and recruiting through deceptive promises.

1.1.5 Voluntary overtime work

All overtime shall be voluntary. Suppliers shall ensure that all employees have the right to refuse

overtime. Under no circumstances shall Suppliers impose any punitive measures on employees

who refuse to work overtime, such as salary deductions or other types of disciplinary action;

any form of coercion, such as the threat of dismissal; or denial of future overtime opportunities.

Suppliers shall not set production quotas or piecework assignments that require employees to

work beyond their regular working hours to earn the legal minimum wage or the prevailing

industry wage.

1.1.6 Withholding of wages

Suppliers shall not systematically or deliberately withhold wages from workers as a means to

compel them to retain and deny them of the opportunity to change employer.

1.1.7 Freedom of movement

SHEIN Supplier Responsibility Standards



6



In any supplier-controlled premises, including production sites and/or living areas such as

dormitories and cafeterias, employees' freedom of movement shall not be unreasonably

restricted, such as restricting the time or frequency of drinking and toileting during production

hours, or restricting the right to enter or exit dormitories out of the production hours.

1.1.8 Free to leave employment

Employees shall have the right to end or terminate their employment at any time by giving a

reasonable period of notice (in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws and the

terms of contract/agreement) without penalty.

Suppliers shall not hold, destroy, conceal, confiscate or require employees to surrender

government-issued identifications, passports, immigration documents or work permits to any

party, including third-party agents. Supplier shall only temporarily hold onto such documents as

necessary and permitted by law. Supplier shall provide individual, lockable storage facilities in

the employee's dormitory (if applicable) for employees to store such documents and personal

items. Such storage facilities shall not be opened by Suppliers without authorization while in use

by employees. Suppliers may obtain and retain copies of workers' identification documents.

Suppliers are not allowed to collect deposits of any kind from employees.

1.1.9 Employment agreement

Suppliers shall provide all employees with a written employment agreement in the worker's

native language that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment, whether

or not required by local laws and regulations.

1.1.10 Special protection for foreign workers

Suppliers are not allowed to employ any workers, including illegal immigrants, who do not have

the legal right to work, unless the employees are related to an approved program with refugee

populations.

Foreign workers shall receive an employment agreement before departing from the country of

origin and no substitutions or changes are allowed in the employment agreement upon arrival

in the receiving country, unless these changes are made to meet local laws and regulations

and provide equal or better conditions.

Suppliers and the recruitment agencies, labor brokers or other third parties providing human

resources related services they use, shall not charge employees, directly or indirectly,

recruitment fees or related costs. Recruitment fees and related costs are any fees or costs

incurred in the recruitment process to secure the employment or placement of an employee,

regardless of the form, time or place of collection or payment (in his/her country of origin, in

any intermediate country, or in the country in which he/she is working).



1.2 Child Labor and Young Workers



1.2.1 Prohibition of child labor

Suppliers shall not use child labor in any stage of manufacturing. A "child" is any person under

the age of 15 (or 14 in the case of the exceptions set out in ILO Convention No. 138), or under

the age of completion of compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment

in the country/region, whichever is the highest. For example, in China, minors under the age of

16 shall not be recruited.

Suppliers should establish written policies prohibiting the use of child labor and implement an

appropriate mechanism to verify the age of employees.

If child labor is found, he/she shall be stopped and removed from the workplace immediately.

Necessary support and actions shall be taken to ensure the safety, health, education and

development of the child whose work has been terminated. In the absence of local law, the

factory shall at least fund a medical examination for the child; pay him/her no less than the

SHEIN Supplier Responsibility Standards

local minimum wage for his/her work; and deliver him/her safely to his/her parents or other

guardians, with the cost of transportation, food and lodging borne entirely by the supplier.

1.2.2 Protection of young workers

Young worker is any worker who is over the age of a child as defined above but under the age

of 18.

Young workers may not perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, including

night work (Any work carried out at night, in whole or in part, between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.

or the hours regulated as night work by applicable laws, whichever period is longer) and

overtime. Suppliers employing young workers shall comply with all applicable laws relating to

young workers, including, but not limited to, required registration at local authority, medical

examinations in accordance with applicable laws, appropriate job placement, and proper

work shifts and work hours.

1.2.3 Student workers, interns and apprentices

Suppliers shall conduct rigorous due diligence on educational partners that provide student

workers and interns, maintain reasonable records of student workers and interns, and protect

their rights in accordance with local laws and regulations. In the absence of local law, student

workers and interns should be paid at least the same wage rate as other entry-level workers

performing equal or similar tasks.

Apprenticeship programs should have a limited time duration or be considered as an entry

point to full-time employment upon completion of the program. Suppliers should provide

students with information about how and when the apprenticeship ends, and any job

opportunities, so that apprentices can make an informed decision on whether to participate in

full-time employment.



1.3 Anti-Discrimination



1.3.1 Discrimination in the workplace

Suppliers shall not discriminate on the basis of nationality, race, ethnicity, color, age, sex, sexual

orientation, gender identity, marital status, maternity status, health status, physical, sensory, or

mental disability, religion, political affiliation, union membership, military service status, or any

other legally protected statuses, in hiring and working practices such as recruitment, wages,

promotions, awards, training opportunities, job assignments, and termination.

Suppliers shall not make any decisions that negatively affect the employment status on the

basis of the employee's state of health, unless such decision is dictated by the inherent

requirements of the job or is prudent for workplace safety.

1.3.2 Special protection of women's rights and interests

Suppliers shall not use an employee's marriage, pregnancy, presence or number of children as

a criterion for hiring or continued employment, or as a basis for downward wage adjustments.

Suppliers shall not prohibit female workers from becoming pregnant nor threaten female

workers with adverse employment consequences, including dismissal, loss of their current

positions, or deduction of wages and benefits.

Suppliers shall not require pregnancy, virginity or HIV tests, and shall not coerce or pressure

female workers to use or not use contraception or discriminate against them for their

reproductive choices.

1.3.3 Special protection of religious interests

Suppliers should provide reasonable accommodations and times (e.g., religious holidays and

work breaks) to facilitate the religious activities of employees.

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy1



1. Purpose



SHEIN advocates commercially ethical and responsible approaches for sourcing products, working

with suppliers to inculcate social responsibility and sustainable business practices in our operations

and production. With these objectives in mind, SHEIN has implemented our Supplier Code of

Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards, based on which we have developed the SHEIN

Responsible Sourcing (“SRS”) Management System. This aims to ensure that employees in the

supply chain are treated with respect and dignity, that they operate in a safe, healthy and comfortable

working environment, and that environmental impact is minimized.



This SRS Policy was formulated to ensure the Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility

Standards are properly adhered to, with the SRS Management System firmly implemented across the

supply chain.



2. Scope



This Policy applies to Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers of products under the SHEIN brand and its sub-

brands (collectively “SHEIN-branded products”).



Tier 1 suppliers, also known as “contract manufacturers”, are suppliers of finished SHEIN-branded

products holding direct procurement contracts with SHEIN entities. Tier 2 suppliers include, without

limitation, suppliers of textiles, packaging and other accessories for use by contract manufacturers.



3. Definitions



3.1 SHEIN Supplier Code of Conduct (“CoC”)



The SHEIN Supplier CoC (see Annex 1) specifies the basic requirements that suppliers, including

those within scope as per the above, must adhere to with respect to labor rights, health and safety,

environmental compliance, and business ethics.



3.2 SHEIN Supplier Responsibility Standards



The SHEIN Supplier Responsibility Standards (see Annex 2) set out the specific standards and

requirements that SHEIN suppliers must follow in relation to labor rights, health and safety,

environmental protection, ethics, and management. The SHEIN Supplier Responsibility Standards

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy2



elaborate and expand upon the CoC, setting higher expectations for suppliers to strive towards and

raise their standard of conduct.



3.3 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing Management System



The SRS Management System is a set of tools, criteria, and procedures used to evaluate and improve

suppliers’ performance in relation to labor practice, health and safety, environmental compliance,

business ethics, and management system. The SRS rating is an essential indicator of a supplier’s

performance in social responsibility and sustainable business practices.



3.4 Immediate Termination Violations (“ITVs”)



ITVs are the most severe violations that contravene the requirements set out in the SHEIN Supplier

CoC. Once suppliers are determined to have committed any ITVs, SHEIN will take immediate action

to terminate its business relationship with such suppliers.



ITVs include but are not limited to:



3.4.1 violations against business ethics and transparency: this includes situations where a

supplier bribes an evaluator, or otherwise attempts, to evade an SRS assessment conducted by

SHEIN.



3.4.2 child labor: this is where a supplier employs persons who are under the statutory

minimum age for employment in the respective country/region.



3.4.3 violations against the principle of voluntary employment: this includes:



○ forced, bonded (including debt bondage), or indentured labor, involuntary or

exploitative prison labor, slavery or human trafficking;



○ recruitment by means of threat, violence, coercion, abduction or fraud, or otherwise

forcing individuals to work against their will;



○ requirements by employers or their agents for employees (including foreign workers)

to pay deposits, security, or recruitment fees;



○ possessing, destroying, concealing, or confiscating employee identification or

immigration documents, such as government-issued identification, passports, or work

permits, in order to coerce employees into working.

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy3



3.4.4 harassment or abuse of employees: this includes engaging in, condoning, or tolerating

any form of violence, harassment or abuse (whether physical, sexual, mental, or verbal) against

employees, including gender-based violence and harassment.



3.5 Immediate Remediation Violations (“IRVs”)



IRVs are violations of the SHEIN Supplier CoC that require urgent and comprehensive remediation.

Once a supplier is determined to have committed any IRV, SHEIN mandates that the supplier must

undertake and complete all relevant corrective action within 30 days. Failure to comply will result in

SHEIN terminating its business relationship with the supplier.



IRVs include but are not limited to:



3.5.1 violations of workplace labor standards: this includes engaging in recruitment and/or

employee management practices which are discriminatory in nature, and preventing or interfering

with employees from forming or joining a union or employee organization.



3.5.2 severe violation of standards for payment of salary: this includes cases where an

employee is paid wages lower than the legal minimum locally; and of severe delay in payment

of salary.



3.5.3 endangering people’s lives or causing employees serious injury, significant fire

hazards, or severe and long-term detriment to health: this includes setting up employee

dormitories within production workshops or warehouses; keeping emergency exits of workshops

or dormitories locked; allowing for any form of open flame or employees to smoke in the

workshops and warehouses; failure to ensure the building has sufficient emergency exits to enable

timely evacuation; failure to address risks of falling from high altitudes at the workplace that may

lead to death or serious injury; cracking and subsidence of walls in factories or dormitories that

may lead to building collapse or other accidents.



3.5.4 environmental pollution: this includes unlawful dumping of hazardous waste, or direct

discharge of untreated wastewater and/or waste gas, into the environment.

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy4



4. SRS “Iron Triangle” Management Model



4.1 To ensure and manage compliance, the SRS Management System adopts the “Iron Triangle”

management model. This comprises:

4.1.1 actively implementing the SRS assessments along the supply chain to identify risks in

social responsibility or business practices, i.e., identify the issue(s) (see paragraph 5 below).

4.1.2 utilizing the management tools to deploy a Corrective Action Plan (“CAP”) to track and

remedy issues by requesting suppliers to take mitigation measures or eradicate relevant risks, i.e.,

address the issue(s) (see paragraph 6 below).

4.1.3 continuing to advance supplier capacity building and enabling their self-management of

social responsibility and sustainable business practices, i.e., empower suppliers (see paragraph 7

below).



4.2 With the launch of the SRS Information System, SHEIN has introduced digitalized

management of SRS assessment reports and CAP implementation, thus ensuring SRS-related data is

transparent and traceable.



4.3 SHEIN’s ESG team collaborates with internal and external stakeholders to manage relevant

risks amongst suppliers in order to improve the social responsibility and sustainable business practice

performance of SHEIN’s supply chain.

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy5



5. Implementing the SRS Assessment



5.1 Key requirements



5.1.1 SHEIN may conduct SRS assessments either with “prior notice” or “without prior notice”

of the assessment date, with the former applying to new suppliers and the latter applying to

existing suppliers.



5.1.2 The SRS assessment team consists of accredited internal assessors and/or auditors of

third-party audit agencies authorized by SHEIN. An eligible third-party auditor must obtain

certification from the Association for Professional Social Compliance Auditors (“APSCA”).



5.1.3 SRS assessments are carried out in accordance with the principles of integrity and

transparency. As such, suppliers are expected to agree to and cooperate with the assessment,

including allowing assessors the right to a full inspection, access to any and all areas of their

factories, and the right to review all files and documentation related to SRS management.

Suppliers must also allow private interviews to be conducted with their employees.



5.2 SRS Rating



5.2.1 Based on their SRS assessment results, suppliers may be assigned a rating of A, B, C, D,

or E.



Table 1: SHEIN SRS Rating Standard



SRS Rating SRS Point (P)



A P ≥ 90



B 75 ≤ P < 90



C 60 ≤ P < 75



D 0 < P < 60



E P ≤ 0



5.2.2 Pursuant to the SRS assessment tools and corresponding rating standard, any ITV or IRV

will result in a supplier being classified with an “E” rating.



5.2.3 The SRS assessment rating is an important indicator of a supplier’s overall performance.

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy6



Suppliers with a higher rating, for example, will be entitled to more business opportunities such

as receiving orders to manufacture premium branded products, co-branded licensing products,

and early production orders of evoluSHEIN products.



5.3 Measures and Requirements for New Suppliers



5.3.1 Any prospective new Tier 1 or Tier 2 supplier within the scope of the SRS Policy will

undergo an SRS assessment before being approved to work with SHEIN. Prospective suppliers

rated “E” will not be allowed to work with SHEIN.



5.3.2 SRS assessments for purposes of on-boarding new suppliers may vary in form and can

range from a full on-site assessment, an on-site ITV and IRV inspection, or a remote ITV and IRV

inspection.



5.3.3 Any prospective new supplier who has received an “E” in the initial assessment is entitled

to apply for two additional assessments.



5.4 Measures and Requirements for Existing Suppliers



5.4.1 Existing Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers are subject to a full on-site SRS assessment on an

annual basis, depending on and prioritized based on a risk assessment that takes into account the

supplier's order volume with SHEIN as well as previous SRS grades. Failure to cooperate with

these SRS audits will result in termination. Suppliers rated “D” or “E” are required to undergo

another SRS assessment within the same twelve-month period.



5.4.2 Where a supplier has been rated “E” and determined to have committed an ITV, SHEIN’s

ESG team shall inform SHEIN’s internal business, legal, and customs departments within 24

hours for necessary action. In such circumstances, SHEIN will immediately proceed to terminate

the business relationship with the supplier.



5.4.3 Where a supplier has been rated “E” and determined to have committed an ITV for

violating the principle of voluntary employment (as laid out in sub-paragraph 3.4.3 above),

SHEIN will immediately proceed to terminate the business relationship with the supplier. At the

same time, SHEIN’s internal customs and tax department will be updated on information and

relevant documentation of the goods produced by the supplier – regardless of whether the goods

are in transit or arriving at the destination country. Export of goods from that supplier will be

suspended, and any goods already shipped will be disposed of in an environmentally friendly

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy7



manner such as through recycling.



5.4.4 Where a supplier has been rated “E” and determined to have committed an IRV, the

supplier must remediate all identified IRVs within 30 days from the date of the SRS assessment.

Failing which, SHEIN will proceed to terminate the business relationship with the supplier.



5.4.5 Where a supplier has been rated “E” for two consecutive SRS assessments, SHEIN will

proceed to terminate the business relationship with the supplier.



5.4.6 Where a supplier has been rated “D” or below three times (including two “D”, one “E”)

within 24 months, SHEIN will proceed to terminate the business relationship with the supplier.



5.4.7 Suppliers that have been terminated due to any violation of this Policy can only request

re-admission 12 months after termination of the business relationship at the earliest. In such

circumstances, such suppliers will need to undergo an onboarding SRS assessment once more.



5.5 Subcontractor SRS Management



5.5.1 A Tier 1 supplier shall provide SHEIN with truthful and open information of its

contractors (if any), including branch or outsourcing factories, and sub-contractors. Information

to be provided includes the contractor(s)’ / subcontractor(s)’ name, address, zip code, legal

representative or person in charge, and other information as may be requested by SHEIN.



5.5.2 Suppliers shall take measures to ensure that their subcontractors comply with the SHEIN

Supplier CoC, including through independently conducting audits on their subcontractors in line

with the SRS Policy and assessment model.



5.5.3 SHEIN may also decide to conduct SRS audits directly on selected subcontractors in

line with this SRS Policy.

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy8



6. CAP Management



6.1 For all violations identified in the SRS assessment, SHEIN requires suppliers to develop a

Corrective Action Plan, i.e., CAP, and implement effective remedial measures.



6.2 Requirements under the SRS CAP follow a “risk-based” approach. For the varying violations

identified in the SRS assessment, suppliers are required to complete corrective actions within

correspondingly different timeframes based on the severity of the risk related to the respective

violation.



6.2.1 For suppliers identified to have committed an ITV during the SRS assessment, SHEIN

will immediately proceed to terminate its business relationship with the supplier in line with sub-

paragraph 5.4.2 of this Policy. It will nevertheless provide recommendations to the terminated

supplier so that it may immediately remediate the conduct giving rise to the identified ITV.



6.2.2 For suppliers identified to have committed an IRV during the SRS assessment, SHEIN

will provide the supplier with guidelines for improvement and corrective action. Suppliers are

required to undertake and complete all relevant corrective action for IRVs within 30 days of the

determination of the IRV.



6.2.3 For suppliers identified with other violations (i.e., major, medium, and minor violations)

during the SRS assessment, SHEIN will provide the supplier with guidelines for improvement

and corrective action. Suppliers are required to undertake and complete all relevant corrective

action within 90 days of the violation being determined as such.



6.3 SHEIN has established a digital CAP management system and designated specific individuals

from the SRS management team to oversee its implementation. These appointed individuals are

responsible for tracking and verifying the timelines as well as proof of improvement pertaining to all

identified violations. The CAP management system generates comprehensive written reports

detailing the actions under a CAP.



7. Supplier Empowerment



7.1 During the course of supplier selection and onboarding, SHEIN will communicate with new

suppliers the Supplier CoC and this SRS Policy. It will provide appropriate training to support them

in establishing an awareness of social responsibility so as to ensure adherence with the SHEIN

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy9



responsible sourcing standards.



7.2 SHEIN will hold regular “Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing Policy

Training” to reinforce to suppliers the requirements of the Supplier CoC and this SRS Policy, conduct

of SRS assessments, and share industry best practice. This aims to strengthen suppliers’ awareness of

social responsibility and sustainable business practices, and support suppliers’ continual improvement

under the SRS standards.



7.3 SHEIN works with world leading training service providers to host face-to-face “SRS

Management Specialist Certification Training” workshops. This is with a view to empowering

suppliers’ self-management in social responsibility and sustainable business practices. This workshop

covers a variety of topics, such as SRS Policy interpretation, awareness and management, as well as

training in labor rights, occupational health and safety, and environmental compliance. Attendee

supplier personnel are examined on the workshop material and certified as an SRS specialist if they

pass.



7.4 Based on the data disclosed through the SRS assessment results, SHEIN carries out targeted

knowledge and skills training for suppliers with respect to high-risk and common violations. This is

to reduce risk across SHEIN’s supply chain overall, uplifting social responsibility performance and

sustainable business practices amongst suppliers.



8. Responsible Exit



8.1 SHEIN is committed to collaborating with suppliers and taking proactive measures to mitigate

the potential negative impacts on employees caused by the sudden termination of the business

relationship due to violations of the SRS Policy.



8.2 Once the decision is made to terminate a business relationship, SHEIN will conduct an impact

assessment, considering the potential negative effects that the cessation of SHEIN's business may

have on the supplier's employees.



8.3 SHEIN will, in accordance with the terms stipulated in the procurement contract, remit full

payment to the terminated supplier within the shortest time frame permitted by applicable policies.



8.4 If the termination of the SHEIN business relationship with a supplier necessitates that the

supplier dismisses employees, SHEIN will, to the extent possible, support these displaced employees

in securing new employment opportunities. This may include providing recruitment information from

Version: 4.0 SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy10



other suppliers with whom SHEIN maintains business relationships.

SHEIN-QMS-BS-0107 MRSL B0 - 1 -



1. Background and Purpose

1.1 Background

SHEIN focuses on consumer safety, as well as protecting workers, local communities, and the environment

from potential harmful chemicals. MRSL is a list of prohibited intentionally used chemical substances

compiled by ZDHC, applied for chemical formulations such as dyes, additives, and finishing agents used in

the textile, clothing, and footwear industries. It helps to protect workers, local communities, and the

environment from potential harmful chemical substances. SHEIN agrees with ZDHC's MRSL list and refers to

it to prepare the standard of Manufacturing Restricted Substance List (MRSL), advocating for all suppliers to

comply with this standard.

1.2 Purpose

In order to improve the quality management system and quality standard system of SHEIN Group, and to

improve the restricted substance standards for chemical formulas used in the production process, we have

formulated the Manufacturing Restricted Substance List (MRSL).

In order to unify the relevant standards for chemical formulas processed in the textile, clothing, and footwear

industries of SHEIN Group and reduce the operational risks of SHEIN Group's related products, this standard

is specially formulated.

2. Scope

This standard applies to all chemical formulas used by textile, clothing, and footwear suppliers of various

brands and channels in the production process under the self operated business model of SHEIN Group.

Chemical formulas include but are not limited to solvents, cleaning agents, adhesives, paints, inks, cleaning

agents, dyes, colorants, and additives, coatings, and finishing agents used in raw materials, production, wet

treatment, and maintenance processes.

Note: This standard is in line with the requirements for finished products in the SHEIN-QMS-BS-0100 SHEIN

RSL Chemical Limited Substance Management Specification. All formulas used in the production process

must meet the requirements of this standard, and the finished product must also meet the requirements of

SHEIN-QMS-BS-0100 SHEIN RSL Chemical Limited Substance Management Specification.

3. Terms and definitions

The following definitions apply to this standard:

ZDHC: Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals, also known as Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals,

is committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals and implementing sustainable chemicals in the fields of

leather, textiles, and synthetic materials.

MRSL: Manufacturing Restricted Substances List.

Formula: refers to the chemical formulas used in the textile, clothing, and footwear industries, including

solvents, cleaning agents, adhesives, paints, inks, cleaning agents, dyes, colorants, additives, coatings,

and finishing agents.

Natural dyes: Refers to dyes obtained from plants, animals, or mineral resources that are not artificially

synthesized and have not undergone any chemical processing

Polymer (R\&F\&A): polymer (rubber, foam, adhesive)

GC/MS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry

ICP: Inductively Coupled Plasma

LC/MS: Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry

OES: Direct Reading Spectrometer

SDS: Safety Data Sheet is a comprehensive explanatory document that includes 16 items such as

chemical composition information, physical and chemical parameters, ignition and explosion performance,

toxicity, environmental hazards, as well as safe use methods, storage conditions, leakage emergency

response, and transportation regulatory requirements.

4. Requirements of MRSL

In order to better protect workers, local communities, and the environment from potential harmful chemical

substances, we advocate and encourage suppliers to:

1) Intentional use of silica (CAS#14464-46-1) is prohibited in sandblasting processes, as silica dust can lead

to kidney disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, long-term inhalation of silica dust can

also lead to fatal silicosis. OSHA (Occupational Health and Safety Administration of the United States) has

Security Level: Restricted  Internal  Public █ SHEIN QMS Controlled Document



SHEIN-QMS-BS-0107 MRSL B0 - 2 -



listed many silica alternatives that can be used for sandblasting materials, including alumina, baking soda,

coal slag, copper slag, and corn cob particles. We encourage suppliers to actively use safer alternatives;

2) All chemical formulas used in the production process follow Table 1-4 and actively identify and analyze

potential restricted substances;

3) Use the SDS safety data sheet to record and confirm that all formulations contain restricted substances

that meet the limit requirements listed in Table 5;

4) If necessary, conduct testing to confirm that all formulas meet the limit requirements listed in Table 5;

5) When the supplier or formula has a certificate issued by ZDHC, it is deemed that the supplier or formula

fully meets the requirements of this standard;

6) If there is a conflict between this standard and the latest version of ZDHC MRSL, the requirements of the

latest version of ZDHC MRSL shall prevail.

5. Instructions and content of MRSL

MRSL consists of a total of 5 tables, among which Tables 1 to 4 are MRSL risk assessment tables, which are

further divided into Table 1- Textile MRSL based on the type of material Risk Assessment Form, Table 2-

Leather MRSL Risk Assessment Form, Table 3- Synthetic Material MRSL Risk Assessment Form, and Table

4- Polymer MRSL Risk Assessment Form.

Determine the potential risks of restricted substances based on different materials and chemical formulations

used in different stages, and then use Table 5-MRSL find the corresponding limit values for the restricted

substances in the limit table, and ultimately determine whether the formula meets the requirements of MRSL.

In Tables 1 to 4:

X indicates that the substance has a high risk and is recommended for testing;

(X) Indicates that there is a risk of this substance, and the supplier can test it as needed.

Note: If the formula is not listed in Tables 1 to 4, professional personnel from the accredited laboratory in Part

6 can assist in determining the potential risk of restricted substances and determine the applicable testing

items.

In Table 5, the testing method is the preferred recommended testing method, while SHEIN acknowledges

other effective internal tests from the accredited laboratory in Part 6.

The specific content of Tables 1 to 5 is as follows:

Note

Used in the manufacture of Indigo and some azo dyes. Residues from manufacturing can remain in the formulation. For all dyes other than indigo, it is important that non-reductive methods are used so that only the free aniline

is analysed rather than that which could be formed by the cleavage of a dye molecule. For indigo, aniline can be tied up in insoluble clusters of dye and so a reductive method that fully solubilises the dye and liberates free

aniline is used. The levels of aniline in indigo must be achieved by removal of the aniline and not by dilution, with a minimum indigo content of 30% being required.

3 Introduction on regulations

3.1 EU

3.1.1 REACH



Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, known as Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction ofChemicals, or REACH, aims to enhance the protection of human health and the environment from therisks that chemicals may pose, while improving the competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry. It alsopromotes alternative methods of assessing the hazards of substances in order to reduce the number oftests on animals. The regulation operates mainly in the form of registration, assessment, authorizationand restriction.

1) Registration: Under normal or reasonably foreseeable circumstances, the articles contain substancesintentionally released, and the total amount of chemical substances intentionally released reaches 1ton/year, which requires registration.2) Authorization: substances listed in Annex XIV can only be used after being authorized; When thearticles contain more than 0.1% of the substances of high concern (SVHC) in the candidate list,information transmission is required, and when it exceeds 1 ton/year, notification is required.3) Restriction: REACH Annex XVII restricts chemical substances that may cause unacceptable effectson human health and the environment. If the product contains chemical substances in Annex XVII andexceeds the specified limit, it will be prohibited to put on the EU market.

3.1.2 POPs



Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on persistentorganic pollutants, abbreviated POPs, refers to organic substances that persist in the environment,accumulate in living organisms and pose a risk to our health and the environment. They can betransported by air, water or migratory species across international borders to areas where they havenever been produced or used. POPs are derived from the Stockholm Convention and the Aarhus Protocol.

The POPs legislation aims to protect human health and the environment through specific controlmeasures such as

1) Prohibit or severely restrict the production, placing on the market and use of persistent organicpollutants.2) Minimizing environmental releases of POPs formed as a by-product of industry.3) Ensure that stockpiles of restricted POPs are managed safely.4) Ensure the environmentally sound disposal of wastes consisting of or contaminated with POPs.

For enterprises exporting products to the EU, they mainly focus on the requirements of the list ofprohibited substances in Annex I and the list of restricted substances in Annex II. At present, the list ofrestricted substances in Annex II is empty, so they focus on the requirements of the list of prohibitedsubstances in Annex I. Typical substances include flame retardants such as hexabromocyclodecane(HBCDD), short chain chlorinated paraffin (SCCP), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and its derivatives(PFOS and its derivatives).
