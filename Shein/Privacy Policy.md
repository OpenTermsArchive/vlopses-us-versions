SHEIN adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles([https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principles](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principles)).

*   **C.** _Web Pixels._ To see how successful our marketing campaigns or other features of the Services are performing we sometimes use conversion pixels, which fire a short line of code to tell us when you have clicked on a particular button or reached a particular page (ex: a thank you page once you have completed the procedure for subscribing to one of our services or have completed one of our forms). We also use web pixels to analyze usage patterns on our Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record that a particular device, browser, or application has visited a particular webpage.
*   **D.** _Analytics and Social Media Advertisements_. We may use third-party service providers to analyze the use of our Services or serve interest-based advertisements on their platforms. Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics, available at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) . To modify your preferences or turn off personalization for ads served by Facebook, you can visit Facebook's [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053). in addition to the Your Choices section below. We may also show ads to audiences that share similar characteristics as you. To do so, a list of email addresses is irreversibly encrypted through hashing and uploaded or transmitted from our site, and the hashed data is compared against the third party’s own users, generating a “lookalike audience” of matching addresses and deleting the uploaded list. We do not have access to the identity of any person in the "lookalike" audience unless they choose to click on one of our advertisements.
*   **E.** _Java Script_. Pages of our Site may also use Java scripts, which are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components; entity tags, which are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to accelerate website performance; and HTML5 local storage, which allows data from websites to be stored or "cached" within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.
*   **F.** _Other Tracking Technologies_. We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, your device type, IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, webpages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the device or other credentials you use to access the Site for the same purposes.
*   **G.** _Do Not Track_. Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. To the extent that uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Services does not currently process or respond to "DNT" signals.
*   **H.** _Location Information_. You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings.

  

5.How Does SHEIN Secure Your Personal Information?

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to guard your personal data from unauthorized processing, use or disclosure. Our security measures include industry-standard physical, technical, and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your information. We also require our service providers to provide privacy and security controls to protect data shared with them in order to perform services.

The Internet is not an absolutely secure environment, and we cannot guarantee that your personal data will be secure. We therefore strongly recommend that you use a unique, complex password to help us ensure the security of your account. We also strongly recommend that you do not share your password with others or re-use passwords on our Services that you use on other sites or apps, as doing so increases the likelihood of your being the victim of a credential stuffing attack or other malicious cyber behavior. If you feel that the security of your account or personal data has been compromised, please immediately contact us at our dedicated [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html) or as otherwise described in the "Contact Us" section below

**6.2 Right to Opt Out of “Sale”/Sharing/Targeted Advertising -** We do not sell our users’ information to third parties as that term is generally understood. However, making certain identifiers available to third parties may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under certain laws. When you visit our website, we may share some personal identifiers such as cookies and other tracking technologies for analytics and to personalize your experience with targeted ads as described herein. In the previous 12 months, we may have shared identifiers and inferences about you with our partners, third parties, and affiliates in such a way that, under such privacy laws, may be interpreted as “selling” or “sharing”. Please see the "Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies" section above for a description of opting out of cookies and controlling browser settings. If you would like to opt-out of the “sale”/”sharing” of such personal information, targeted advertising, or marketing profiles, you can control such access to your data by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”/ “Manage Cookies” link on the bottom of the webpage, or in the Settings menu in your mobile app.

**6.5 Requests from Authorized Agents/Third Parties** **\-** For the protection of your account and the security of your data, only you or a person you formally authorize to act on your behalf may make a privacy request related to your personal information. If you use an authorized agent to submit such a request, we will require written proof that the authorized agent has been authorized to act on your behalf, which we obtain in the request verification process. Third parties may submit requests on a data subject's behalf; however, requests will still need to be directed to the data subject themselves for verification and authorization to proceed.

**6.6 Right Against Discrimination -** You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described in this section. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of the rights described herein.

**6.7 Account Verification -** SHEIN is legally obligated to verify the identity of a requester to ensure that personal information from your account can only be accessed and released to duly authorized parties. To verify your request, we will send a verification email to the e-mail address you provide. Once you click the verification link, we will be able to proceed with processing the request based on the verified email address. However, if your account is associated with an email address other than the one provided for verification, we will be unable to fulfill your request and will require you to resubmit your request using your email address associated with your account. We may not accommodate a data subject request if we believe the change would violate any legal requirement or pose an unacceptable risk to the privacy or security of our customers.

**6.10 Automated Decision-Making -** Some states grant rights to request that businesses not engage in certain types of automated decision making about you. Because SHEIN does not use automated decision making that is subject to this right, we do not accept requests to opt out of automated decision making.

**6.11 Self-Service Tools -** In addition to the SHEIN Privacy Rights Request Center options described above, SHEIN voluntarily offers a variety of self-service tools, where you can learn more about the data in your record, export your profile information, make corrections, change your password, and request to have your account deleted. Because the self-service tools are accessible through a customer’s “My Profile” feature, they are only accessible to current account holders; all other persons should submit a DSR through the “SHEIN Privacy Rights Request Center” link in the Privacy Center.

7\. Additional Privacy Matters

7.1 Third Party Websites - Our Services may contain links to third-party sites. This Policy does not apply to those third-party sites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements of any other sites that you visit as we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.

Children’s Profiles: A parent or other adult may add a profile for you to their own personal profile. This allows them to tell us what kinds of products they like to buy for you. We use this information to recommend other products to them which we think they might like to buy for you.

  

To create this profile, we need to know the approximate age of the child (i.e., what month and year the child was born in) and whether the child is a girl or a boy. We also ask the parent to affirm that they have the legal authority to post the information being provided. The parent or guardian will also be asked to create a nickname for the profile. To best protect the privacy interests of the child, you should not use the child’s name.

This profile will only be visible to the person who creates it.

If a minor has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us immediately to remove the relevant personal information and unsubscribe the minor. As described further in our [Terms and Conditions](https://us.shein.com/Terms-and-Conditions-a-399.html), please do not upload photographs showing other people, in particular if they are minors.

7.3 Transfers of Your Personal Data Outside the US - This Privacy Policy only applies to residents of the United States.

For some sellers located in the US, they may also maintain business operations outside the US and need to transfer data to other countries in order to fulfill orders. We may also share your personal data with our worldwide affiliates, including those in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, under the terms of our Global Intra Group Data Transfer Agreement. Such countries may have data protection laws that are less protective than the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. For these transfers, we rely on appropriate safeguards as permitted under applicable law and standards. If you do not want your information transferred to, processed, accessed, or maintained outside of the United States, please understand that you may not be able to order products from the Services..

Our Site is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 16 or minors (as defined by applicable national laws). If you are a minor, please do not attempt to fill out our forms or send any personal information about yourself to us. If a minor has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us (See Section 11) immediately to remove the relevant personal information and unsubscribe the minor.

If we become aware that a minor has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to promptly delete such information from our files.

9\. Social Media Accounts

We operate accounts and fan pages on different social media platforms (the **“Social Media Accounts”**).

If you visit one of our Social Media Accounts, you initiate a variety of data processing operations. Below we identify the other types of entities with whom you may interact when you visit one of our Social Media Accounts. If you do not provide us with your personal data, certain functionalities of the social networking platforms requiring such data will not be available to you or only to a limited extent.

As the owner of a Social Media Account, we can usually only see information stored in your public profile on such social media platform, and only insofar as you are logged in to your profile while visiting our Social Media Account. In addition, we may process data that you provide to us when you contact us through one of our Social Media Accounts (for example: if you create a post or send us a private message via Facebook). If you visit one of our Social Media Accounts, the operator of the respective social network also processes your data, regardless of whether you yourself have a profile in the respective social network. The individual data processing operations and their scope differ depending on the operator.

In addition, the respective operator of the social network provides us with anonymous usage statistics, which we use to improve the user experience. We do not have access to the usage data that the operator of the social network collects to create these statistics. Facebook, for example, has committed to us to assume primary responsibility under the GDPR for the processing of this data, to comply with all obligations under the GDPR in this regard, and to provide visitors to our profile with the essence of this commitment. These data processing operations serve our legitimate interest in improving the user experience when visiting our profile in line with the target group.

We do not have access to the identity of any person in the "lookalike" audience unless they choose to click on one of our advertisements.

You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings.

  

5.How Does SHEIN Secure Your Personal Information?

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to guard your personal data from unauthorized processing, use or disclosure. Our security measures include industry-standard physical, technical, and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your information. We also require our service providers to provide privacy and security controls to protect data shared with them in order to perform services.

The Internet is not an absolutely secure environment, and we cannot guarantee that your personal data will be secure. We therefore strongly recommend that you use a unique, complex password to help us ensure the security of your account. We also strongly recommend that you do not share your password with others or re-use passwords on our Services that you use on other sites or apps, as doing so increases the likelihood of your being the victim of a credential stuffing attack or other malicious cyber behavior. If you feel that the security of your account or personal data has been compromised, please immediately contact us at our dedicated [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html) or as otherwise described in the "Contact Us" section below

  

6\. What Are Your Privacy Rights and How to Exercise Them?

Depending on where you live, residents of certain states (including but not limited to California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nebraska, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington) may have privacy rights relating to their personal information which are described below. In addition to these covered individuals, SHEIN has chosen to extend these same privacy options to all US customers, so that any SHEIN customer in the US can exercise the privacy choices described in this Section.

**6.1 Access, Correction, and Deletion of your Personal Information -** Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete the personal information that we collect. However, your rights are subject to certain exceptions according to the applicable law. For instance, we cannot disclose specific pieces of personal information if the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of the personal information, your account with us or the security of our network systems.

*   *   **_Right to Know/Access/Portability_** \- If you want to access the information we collected or disclosed about you, the business purposes involved and the sources of such information, you can request to receive a copy of your personal data in a structured and machine-readable format. You can submit an access request by either completing the request form at our dedicated [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html) (either by logging in or through Visitor Mode) or by sending us an email at [privacy@sheingroup.com](mailto:privacy@sheingroup.com) (provide your full name, email address (linked to your account or for verification), and the nature of your request).
    *   **_Right to Correction/Rectification_** \- If you believe that we have incorrect or incomplete information about you**_,_** you can submit a correction request by either completing the request form at our dedicated [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html) (either by logging in or through Visitor Mode) or by sending us an email at [privacy@sheingroup.com](mailto:privacy@sheingroup.com) (provide your full name, email address linked to your account, and the nature of your request).
    *   _**Right to be Forgotten/Deletion** \-_ You can request that we permanently erase your personal information from our records by either completing the request form at our dedicated [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html) (either by logging in or through Visitor Mode) or by sending us an email at [privacy@sheingroup.com](mailto:privacy@sheingroup.com). If you request that your personal data be deleted, you will not be able to login again and any associated information will be deleted. This will include any SHEIN Wallet Credits, coupon codes, points, VIP status, address book entries, and other information associated with your customer profile. However, please note that per SHEIN Privacy Policy, some data may be retained to the extent it is permitted by applicable law and/or is necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, we may retain your order history information to satisfy legally required financial reporting obligations), resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements and policies.In addition, deletion of your data may limit our ability to confirm your purchases and thereby prevent us from providing customer support. Also, if you have currently pending orders, fulfillment of your deletion request may be delayed until all pending orders are delivered. If you want to shop at SHEIN in the future, you’ll need to set up a new account.

**6.2 Right to Opt Out of “Sale”/Sharing/Targeted Advertising -** We do not sell our users’ information to third parties as that term is generally understood. However, making certain identifiers available to third parties may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under certain laws. When you visit our website, we may share some personal identifiers such as cookies and other tracking technologies for analytics and to personalize your experience with targeted ads as described herein. In the previous 12 months, we may have shared identifiers and inferences about you with our partners, third parties, and affiliates in such a way that, under such privacy laws, may be interpreted as “selling” or “sharing”. Please see the "Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies" section above for a description of opting out of cookies and controlling browser settings. If you would like to opt-out of the “sale”/”sharing” of such personal information, targeted advertising, or marketing profiles, you can control such access to your data by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”/ “Manage Cookies” link on the bottom of the webpage, or in the Settings menu in your mobile app.

**6.3 Unsubscribe from Our Marketing Communications -** If you do not want us to use your email account to send you marketing emails or non-transactional promotional materials, please directly click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our marketing email messages to you or contact us at our dedicated [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html). If you previously consented to receive text messages (SMS) and mobile notifications, you can reply “STOP” to any SMS (text) message to cancel or contact us at our dedicated [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html). If you wish to stop push notifications or alerts to your mobile device through our app, you can stop these notifications by changing the settings on your mobile device.

**6.4 Objection to Processing/Unauthorized Account Creation (Unbind) -** If someone has created a SHEIN account using your email address without your authorization, you can "unbind" the account from your email address. To process this request, please submit a request in the Privacy Center under the "Object to Processing" option and enter "unbind" in the "Additional Comments"/”Detailed Description” field.

**6.5 Requests from Authorized Agents/Third Parties** **\-** For the protection of your account and the security of your data, only you or a person you formally authorize to act on your behalf may make a privacy request related to your personal information. If you use an authorized agent to submit such a request, we will require written proof that the authorized agent has been authorized to act on your behalf, which we obtain in the request verification process. Third parties may submit requests on a data subject's behalf; however, requests will still need to be directed to the data subject themselves for verification and authorization to proceed.

**6.6 Right Against Discrimination -** You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described in this section. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of the rights described herein.

**6.7 Account Verification -** SHEIN is legally obligated to verify the identity of a requester to ensure that personal information from your account can only be accessed and released to duly authorized parties. To verify your request, we will send a verification email to the e-mail address you provide. Once you click the verification link, we will be able to proceed with processing the request based on the verified email address. However, if your account is associated with an email address other than the one provided for verification, we will be unable to fulfill your request and will require you to resubmit your request using your email address associated with your account. We may not accommodate a data subject request if we believe the change would violate any legal requirement or pose an unacceptable risk to the privacy or security of our customers.

**6.8 Lodging Complaints -** If you believe we have infringed or violated your privacy rights, please contact us at [privacy@sheingroup.com](mailto:privacy@sheingroup.com)so that we may attempt to resolve any issues to your satisfaction.

**6.9 Appeal -** If you would like to appeal any decision made by the company relative to your privacy rights, please directly reply to the correspondence received from the company relating to the decision.

**6.10 Automated Decision-Making -** Some states grant rights to request that businesses not engage in certain types of automated decision making about you. Because SHEIN does not use automated decision making that is subject to this right, we do not accept requests to opt out of automated decision making.

**6.11 Self-Service Tools -** In addition to the SHEIN Privacy Rights Request Center options described above, SHEIN voluntarily offers a variety of self-service tools, where you can learn more about the data in your record, export your profile information, make corrections, change your password, and request to have your account deleted. Because the self-service tools are accessible through a customer’s “My Profile” feature, they are only accessible to current account holders; all other persons should submit a DSR through the “SHEIN Privacy Rights Request Center” link in the Privacy Center. You can find more information about the self-service tools available to account holders [here](https://us.shein.com/additional-self-service-tools-a-3274.html) \[[Additional Self-Service Tools](https://us.shein.com/additional-self-service-tools-a-3274.html)\].

  

7\. Additional Privacy Matters

7.1 Third Party Websites - Our Services may contain links to third-party sites. This Policy does not apply to those third-party sites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements of any other sites that you visit as we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.

7.2 Children’s Data - In order to use this site, you must be at least 18 years old. SHEIN doesn’t sell products for purchase by children. We may sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you're under 18, you may use SHEIN only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

If you are under 18. SHEIN may process some of your personal data:

Product reviews: A parent or other adult who buys an item for you may take a photo of you and post it as part of a review of that product. Parents are advised not to post photos where the child’s face is identifiable.

Children’s Profiles: A parent or other adult may add a profile for you to their own personal profile. This allows them to tell us what kinds of products they like to buy for you. We use this information to recommend other products to them which we think they might like to buy for you.

  

To create this profile, we need to know the approximate age of the child (i.e., what month and year the child was born in) and whether the child is a girl or a boy. We also ask the parent to affirm that they have the legal authority to post the information being provided. The parent or guardian will also be asked to create a nickname for the profile. To best protect the privacy interests of the child, you should not use the child’s name.

This profile will only be visible to the person who creates it.

If a minor has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us immediately to remove the relevant personal information and unsubscribe the minor. As described further in our [Terms and Conditions](https://us.shein.com/Terms-and-Conditions-a-399.html), please do not upload photographs showing other people, in particular if they are minors.

7.3 Transfers of Your Personal Data Outside the US - This Privacy Policy only applies to residents of the United States. If you are a resident of another country, please see the applicable SHEIN Privacy Policy and Terms of Use that is specific to your jurisdiction, which is generally available on the local version of the App or Site or through the [Privacy Center](https://us.shein.com/Privacy-Center-a-1045.html). Please note as well that when you use our Services, your personal data may be accessed or transferred outside of the United States, such as when you order products from a seller located China and your Basic Personal Identifiers are sent to them in order to fulfill your order. For some sellers located in the US, they may also maintain business operations outside the US and need to transfer data to other countries in order to fulfill orders. We may also share your personal data with our worldwide affiliates, including those in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, under the terms of our Global Intra Group Data Transfer Agreement. Such countries may have data protection laws that are less protective than the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. For these transfers, we rely on appropriate safeguards as permitted under applicable law and standards. If you do not want your information transferred to, processed, accessed, or maintained outside of the United States, please understand that you may not be able to order products from the Services..
