Human Rights Policy
===================

SHEIN is a group of affiliated companies operating under several brand names throughout the world. Collectively, the SHEIN Group provides consumer access to a global ecommerce platform or, in some jurisdictions, a marketplace, offering consumer products, fashion, home goods, and related products.

SHEIN is dedicated to operating in a responsible and ethical manner. We have aligned our Human Rights Policy (the “Policy”) with the international principles described in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work,  as well as with the laws and requirements established in the countries where SHEIN and our suppliers operate.

The Human Rights Policy applies to the entire SHEIN Group and its employees, and also covers any person associated with the company.

**Our Commitment**

We are committed to honoring and protecting the rights of our employees and supporting our suppliers to protect the rights of their own workers. We see our responsibility for advancing human rights as:

*   Rejecting forced labor, harassment, discrimination, and unsafe working conditions for our employees. We do not employ children or prison laborers. We respect our employees’ rights of assembly, speech, self-expression, association, and freedom from unlawful discrimination.
*   Protecting the human rights of our suppliers’ workers. We recognize that our responsibilities extend throughout our supply chains, and expect our suppliers to share our commitment to human rights. Suppliers who work with SHEIN must sign and agree to abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is informed by the UDHR and the core conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and strictly prohibits the use of forced labor and child labor.

**Supplier Management**

We take a systematic approach to supplier management. Our SHEIN Responsible Sourcing (SRS) Policy establishes clear definitions and penalties for violations of the SHEIN Supplier Code of Conduct, and provides for regular audits of our suppliers to evaluate compliance.  Suppliers are graded on a scale from A to E, and in all cases, suppliers receive a copy of their SRS audit report together with a set of remediation suggestions to facilitate improvements.

Taking reference from international standards, violations involving forced labor and child labor are treated with utmost severity under our framework. If such violations are identified, SHEIN will take immediate action to terminate its business relationship with the supplier. Other violations in areas such as freedom of association & right to collective bargaining, wages and benefits, working hours, and workplace health and safety are also treated seriously, with suppliers required to remediate their practices within 30 days or similarly face termination of business relations.

Workers have the right to escalate grievances to SHEIN without fear of retaliation. Discrimination against whistleblowers is strictly prohibited under our policies. SHEIN maintains a multichannel feedback system for reporting concerns via email, call, or text, and supplier partners are required to ensure visible posting of posters publicizing these grievance channels to their workers.

SHEIN is also committed to training our suppliers and equipping them with the tools and knowledge to act responsibly in compliance with our requirements, including with respect to human rights. We regularly conduct workshops with suppliers to sharpen their understanding of our supply chain governance policies, and learn how to improve their labor practices.

**Environmental Laws and Regulations**

SHEIN is committed to upholding environmental regulations, laws, and best practices wherever it does business. All suppliers are expected to comply with environmental requirements, and we work hard to ensure that our products are designed and produced in accordance with environmental laws. Environmental protection is key to supporting local communities whose health and livelihoods depend on a clean and balanced ecosystem.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

SHEIN recognizes that advancing human rights involves many stakeholders and partners, including our employees and suppliers.

*   Employees. SHEIN expects each employee to reflect our collective commitment to human rights, and takes action against any employees found to act in contravention our policies and requirements.
*   Suppliers. As outlined above, SHEIN’s Supplier Code of Conduct similarly obliges suppliers to adhere to all our standards and requirements with respect to human rights, and we will take action against errant suppliers in line with the provisions of our SRS Policy.

**Governance**

Our senior management is responsible for overseeing the implementation of this Policy, and receives regular updates on our commitments to advancing human rights and – through the SRS – our suppliers’ related efforts. Any changes to this Policy must be approved by our senior management, including our Executive Chairman and CEO.

**Transparency**

We recognize that advancing human rights is a journey, and we are committed to sharing information transparently about our journey. That is why we publish an annual sustainability and social impact report reviewed and approved by our highest levels of leadership.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement
=========================================

SHEIN is built on the idea that there is no single standard for beauty and that individuality has inherent value that should be expressed without fear of discrimination. We are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive business, that honors and respects the individuality of our customers and that maintains a fair and welcoming workplace for our employees so that they can bring their unique contributions to the company. Inclusion is both the key to our position in the marketplace and the key to creating an innovative and productive workforce.

SHEIN employees are given equal employment and promotion opportunities.  Our intent is to create a workplace that is welcoming and inclusive for people from any national or cultural background, any gender or sexual identity, any level of disability, any religious belief and any race or ethnic identify. We require all employees to abide by our Global Code of Ethics, which prohibits any form of harassment or discrimination based on nationality, ethnicity, race, color, creed, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, ancestry, age, location, appearance and figure, religion, sexual orientation, political views, physical or mental disability, protected medical condition, family background and marital status, or other personal characteristics.  

Furthermore, SHEIN expects and requires its suppliers to do the same in accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct and in compliance with all applicable national, state and local laws related to anti-discrimination, anti-harassment and anti-retaliation as well as equal opportunity laws in the countries where they operate. 

We invest in structured systems such as training and awareness raising as well as support for informal tools like employee resource groups. This commitment is applied in our hiring, promotion and transfer decisions and in all aspects of the workplace such as training and mentorship opportunities.

Beyond the workplace, SHEIN is committed to making fashion accessible to all people of all, seeking to support and serve a diverse customer base representing a beautiful mix of ethnicities, body types and socioeconomic backgrounds. We also seek to uplift the voices and talents of individuals who have traditionally lacked access to opportunity.

SHEIN is committed to providing a healthy and safety work environment for all our employees, and to safeguarding workers’ rights under the law of the countries where it operates. SHEIN provides health and wellness support, which may take the form of trainings, benefits, and/or other resources, to its employees to promote awareness. SHEIN also works hard to identify potential risks to the health and safety of its staff and mitigate those risks in a timely manner with consideration of respected guidance on the given matter. 

SHEIN expects its Supplier Partners to likewise protect the health and safety of their workers and works to promote awareness within its supply chain. SHEIN requires Suppliers to operate in strict compliance with its Code of Conduct and with the local and national laws, rules, governmental orders and regulatory requirements wherein those Suppliers operate.

Suppliers must comply with all applicable health and safety laws, rules and regulations and shall provide a safe, hygienic and healthy workplace environment in compliance with all local and regional laws, and that promote accident prevention and minimize exposure to health and safety risks and take necessary measures to prevent employees from accidents and injuries arising out of, or related to, work in the course of their services including fire safety, sanitary facilities, access to potable water, adequate lighting, ingress and egress and safe ventilation. Supplier Partners should encourage employees to report all accidents, injuries, unsafe or hazardous working conditions and a mechanism to alert Supplier Partners’ management before performing tasks if the work is considered unsafe.  Supplier Partners must also ensure that the same standards of health and safety are applied in any housing provided to employees. 

Supplier Partners’ employees who handle chemicals, waste and hazardous wastes should be properly trained in how to deal with substances and the potential hazards the material presents if mismanaged or released to the worker and environment. Supplier Partners should use permitted transporters and haulers that have a positive record of operating safely and complying with applicable transportation laws and best management practices.
