SHEIN Green Claims Statement
============================

SHEIN strives to provide clear, specific, accurate, reliable, substantiated and transparent information to consumers and other stakeholders in relation to its environmental and social claims (“**Green Claims**”).  We believe that this will not only empower consumers in making better informed purchasing decisions, but is also compliant with anti-greenwashing, consumer protection and other relevant regulations.

SHEIN will not knowingly mislead consumers and other stakeholders through unsubstantiated, generic, vague or otherwise misleading Green Claims about our SHEIN-branded products, product lines, initiatives, or our wider business.  These Green Claims can be made through our SHEIN-branded product listings, marketing communications (e.g. consumer sites, social media, and marketing campaigns) and corporate-level communications.  SHEIN is working continuously to enhance its internal practices and will actively ensure the communication of clear and accurate information through the implementation of relevant internal controls, procedures and mechanisms.

While we aim to promote well-informed decision-making for consumers and other stakeholders on Green Claims, perceptions of “greenwashing” can be subjective and global guidance and standards are evolving.  As such, should we become aware that a Green Claim might be considered misleading, we will act swiftly to address this as appropriate on a case-by-case basis, which may include amending or removing the claim.

Where we become aware that a Green Claim by a third-party (e.g. a contractor, agent, or service provider of SHEIN) may be considered misleading, we will work constructively with, or seek to influence (if possible), the relevant third party to correct the misleading Green Claim to the best of our ability.  We have no control over any Green Claims that are (or may be) considered misleading in third-party contexts with no business relationship with us.  Should such a case arise, however, we will seek to respond appropriately.
