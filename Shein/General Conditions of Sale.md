Quality Check for Returns

1\. Please make sure you do not include any items that were not purchased on the SHEIN Site or App by mistake in your return package. We will not be responsible for sending those items back to you.

2\. When a returned item arrives at our warehouse, we will inspect and/or test it to ensure it is return- eligible and meets the applicable return requirements listed above. If the item passes our quality check, we will issue a refund. If our inspection finds that the returned item is not return-eligible or does not meet the return requirements listed above, we will reject the return and refuse to issue a refund or credit.

3\. If the returned item is used or damaged, has missing parts/accessories, or is damaged due to improper use, and this is not due to SHEIN or the seller, the refund will be reduced to compensate for the lost value of the item. If the returned item is entirely in a non-resalable condition, we will not issue any refund to you.

4\. In certain cases, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to offer a refund on the rejected-return item, instead of sending it back to you.
