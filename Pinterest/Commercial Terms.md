Commercial and Branded Content Guidelines


=============================================

Commercial Content Guidelines
=============================

Commercial content is content on Pinterest that is designed to promote, directly or indirectly, goods or services. This can include promoted content (also subject to our Advertising Guidelines), Product Pins (also subject to our Merchant Guidelines) and organic content. All content on Pinterest, including Commercial Content, is subject to our Community Guidelines.

If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and post Commercial Content on Pinterest, you must ensure that your Commercial Content:

* Includes a clear disclosure indicating its commercial or promotional purpose, and you must use any functionality Pinterest makes available, such as including a # or applying a label if available,
* Is not deceptive or misleading, such as using surreptitious techniques, subliminal messages or making fake claims, or secretly conveying messages to influence people without their awareness.
* Is not exploiting the inexperience of, or special trust placed in authority figures by minors, or otherwise encouraging minors to persuade their caretakers to purchase goods and services.

In addition to abiding by the [Community Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines) and, where applicable, [Advertising Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines) and [Merchant Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/merchant-guidelines), as well as all applicable local laws and regulations, Commercial Content:

Cannot promote or sell:

* Cigarettes, tobacco products, electronic cigarettes or replacement cartridges
* Marijuana and other related products
* Firearms or weapons
* Prescription-only medications or medical treatments

Cannot encourage or depict:

* Excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs, including suggestions that drinking excessively is beneficial, or that alcohol has therapeutic qualities either as a stimulant or relaxant
* People under the influence of alcohol, or associate drinking with activities that are risky (such as driving and operating heavy machinery)
* Minors in unsafe situations

As is prohibited by our [Community Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines) and [Advertising Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines) including our policies on hate, violence, violent actors, child safety, dangerous goods, self-harm and harmful misinformation, Commercial Content cannot encourage:

* Disrespect for human dignity, exploitation, violence or hate
* Discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion, disability, age, or sexual orientation
* Behavior that is harmful to health or safety
* Behavior that is harmful to the environment
* Alcohol or drug consumption by minors or be otherwise aimed at minors
* Behavior or content that is detrimental to a minor's physical, mental or emotional well-being

Finally, you need to ensure that Commercial Content does not misrepresent Pinterest or its products/services and does not imply Pinterest's endorsement or involvement in your commercial activities without permission.

Paid Partnership Guidelines
===========================

A paid partnership is any sponsored or branded content on Pinterest that features or is influenced by a business partner for an exchange of value, such as if a business partner has paid or otherwise incentivized a user to save the content.

All paid partnerships must disclose the commercial nature of their content. Users that participate in paid partnerships must:

* Comply with all applicable advertising laws and regulations
* Include a clear disclosure to indicate the commercial nature of your content (such as the use of #ad to indicate that your content is a paid partnership, or applying a label to your content using Pinterest’s [paid partnership tool](https://help.pinterest.com/business/article/paid-partnerships-for-creators))
* Adhere to our [Advertising Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines), including the prohibited and restricted content Guidelines

To prevent inauthentic content and behavior:

* Make sure you’re posting relevant content to relevant boards
* Keep the content of your posts high-quality and avoid spammy behavior
* Save content you have an authentic interest in

Don't incentivize or pay people to distribute content in large volumes, in spammy ways or for each Pin they save.

* For example, a business can't pay people for each board they follow or Pin they save. It's okay for a business to pay a guest blogger to curate a board for their brand or through pay-per-click payment structures (such as affiliate links), but they can't pay large groups of people to save specific Pins to artificially inflate the popularity of their content.

Affiliate Guidelines
====================

Affiliate links help content creators measure the impact of their contributions and get paid for the work that they do to bring inspiring content to Pinners. However, affiliate programs can be targeted by spammers trying to make money by abusing the program and manipulating the Pinterest platform.

Our Guidelines for affiliates are:

* Always follow our Paid partnership Guidelines above
* In general, you should operate only one Pinterest account. That account should be your authentic presence on Pinterest.
* Affiliate content should be original and add unique value for Pinners.
* Be transparent about the commercial nature of your content and about your links and their behavior. Some shortener services are not currently supported on Pinterest - if your Pin’s link is blocked, you can [edit it](https://help.pinterest.com/article/fix-a-broken-link).
* Don't try to artificially manipulate Pinterest algorithms or Pinner traffic. Some examples of prohibited behavior include:
    * Using fake accounts to create or save your affiliate links.
    * Asking other users to save your affiliate Pins in a quid pro quo.
    * Asking other users to create Pins with links that include your affiliate identifier.

Creating affiliate Pins repetitively or in large volumes - marketers should follow our [spam policy](https://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines#section-spam) and use affiliate links in moderation.

Contest Guidelines
==================

* Don't require people to save a specific image. Give people the ability to choose Pins based on their tastes and preferences, even if it's from a selection or a given website.
* Don't allow more than one entry per person.
* Don't suggest that Pinterest sponsors or endorses you or the promotion.
* Do review our [Brand Guidelines](https://business.pinterest.com/brand-guidelines) for general rules about using the Pinterest brand.
* Lastly, be sure to follow all relevant laws and regulations.

We may remove, limit or block the distribution of content or accounts that violate our Paid Partnership Guidelines, Commercial Content Guidelines, Affiliates Guidelines and Contest Guidelines. If you have questions or encounter problems on Pinterest, you can contact us.

Merchant guidelines enforcement
===============================

We believe that when people find great products from trusted merchants, it can empower them to do things they care about. When we approve a merchant, they gain access to Pinterest’s merchant products, such as Catalogs and Product Pins, which are subject to our Merchant guidelines.

When we become aware of a violation of our Merchant guidelines, we’ll take action:

* **Deactivation**: When we deactivate a Pin, that Pin is no longer available to anyone on the platform. Deactivation can also be referred to as “removal;”
* **Limiting distribution**: When we limit the distribution of a Pin, that Pin will continue to be accessible on Pinterest, but it won’t be featured in recommendation or discovery surfaces, such as search results or the home feed; and/or
* **Merchant rejection**: If a merchant is rejected at any time, they are denied access to Pinterest’s merchant products.

You can read our full Merchant guidelines [here](https://policy.pinterest.com/merchant-guidelines).

Advertising guidelines


==========================

Our mission
===========

Our mission at Pinterest is to bring everyone the inspiration to create the life they love. We believe promoted content can play a big role in helping people create a life they love, which is why we want ads to be some of the best stuff you see on Pinterest. If you follow these guidelines, you’ll be all set for promoting great content on Pinterest.

Be authentic with your audience
===============================

Authenticity means being truthful and honest about the product or service you're promoting. It also means being transparent with people about what they should expect when they interact with your products or services.

#### Be honest about your relationship with Pinterest

Your ads should stick to our [brand guidelines](https://business.pinterest.com/pinterest-brand-guidelines) and shouldn't suggest that Pinterest is sponsoring your promotion or is formally affiliated with it. Basically, your design should look like it came from your business, not from Pinterest. You can use the word "Pinterest," but not our wordmark.

#### Disclose your billing practices

If you charge users on a recurring basis, be transparent with them and disclose the terms of payment.

#### Respect the rights of others

Your ads can't infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark or privacy rights.

Be respectful with your targeting
=================================

Make sure your targeting is relevant and follow all the below guidelines.

#### Don't target sensitive categories

Targeting certain audiences can be inappropriate and offensive. It's never okay to target people in a way that implies you're aware of sensitive info about them. You can't target any audience based on:

* Sensitive health or medical condition
* Race, color or ethnic origin
* Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
* Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
* Sexual behavior, orientation, or gender identity
* Alleged or actual commission of a crime
* Trade union membership or affiliation
* Political affiliation and opinions
* Additionally, you can’t target ads to Pinners under 18 years old

Please note that the targeting of proxies for the sensitive categories above is also not allowed.

#### Protected groups

Some ad categories have additional targeting restrictions. In addition to the sensitive targeting guidelines, in certain markets ads in the following categories can’t use actalike, age, gender or postal code targeting options or exclude Protected groups:

* Credit: Ads promoting credit products like credit cards, mortgages and loans.
* Employment: Ads promoting employment opportunities, including full -time jobs, part -time jobs, and work from home jobs.
* Housing: Ads promoting the purchase, sale, or rental of land or homes.

Keep in mind that age, gender, and familial status are protected, in addition to certain groups for which Pinterest prohibits targeting generally. Ads in these categories using prohibited targeting criteria will not be allowed to run. Ads in these categories that target both prohibited and non-prohibited keywords and/or interests may be approved but will not serve on any prohibited targeting criteria.

Be careful with any data usage
==============================

When using data to target or measure ads on Pinterest, you must follow our [Ad Data Terms](https://policy.pinterest.com/ad-data-terms) and, if applicable, our [Lead Ad Terms](https://help.pinterest.com/business/article/lead-ads). This applies to features like our tag, audiences, and app install campaigns.

#### Follow all measurement and audience targeting rules

Anywhere you collect data used with a Pinterest ads service, you must disclose and get legally-required consent from each individual for that data collection, sharing and use.

If you use the Pinterest tag or send us mobile app activity, you must tell your website and app visitors that their information will be shared with third parties for online behavioral advertising, and that they can opt out of online behavioral advertising through their Pinterest [personalization settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/), the AdChoices website [optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/) (if you use the Pinterest tag), or their mobile ad identifier settings (if you share app activity data with us). Don’t give us information that relates to sensitive categories—like medical condition or ethnic origin—or that’s collected from a child-directed site or app, or from anyone who’s under 13 or the legal age of consent in your country (if higher). Only pass us user identifiers (like Mobile Ad IDs or hashed emails) in designated fields and according to our documentation.

Do not send Pinterest customer lists that are based on user activity from an app or website on an iOS device. Do not send Pinterest information about any individual who has exercised an option to opt out of having such data used for targeted advertising purposes.

#### Respect our community's data and privacy

For all Pinterest ads services:

You can't:

* Use data you collect or receive through a Pinterest ads service for any purpose (including audience targeting or user profiling) other than to understand your Pinterest campaigns, and only on an anonymous basis
* Share data from a Pinterest ads service with a third party, including another advertising service
* Join data from a Pinterest ads service with personally identifiable information (like an email address) or information that identifies a user, browser, or device (like a cookie or mobile ad identifier)

If you receive any data from Pinterest tied to a unique identifier (e.g., campaign reporting data linked to a mobile device ID) then you can’t use it to market products or services, or for any purpose besides measuring Pinterest campaigns, and you must delete it no later than 6 months after receiving it.

Advertisers using ad products that ask for user information have to follow all [advertising guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines).

Advertisers must have a legitimate business reason for collecting the data, respecting the data minimization principle. Asking for home address and date of birth is allowed with restrictions.

In addition, advertisers must not reference or ask via the Pinterest ads service for the following information related to sensitive categories:

* Sensitive health or medical condition, including related to genetics, fertility or pregnancy
* Race, color or ethnic origin
* Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
* Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
* Sexual behavior or orientation
* Alleged or actual commission of a crime
* Trade union membership or affiliation
* Political affiliation or opinions
* Pinners under 18 years old
* Precise geolocation (e.g. GPS)
* Account numbers, including frequent flyer numbers, loyalty card numbers, cable or telephone account numbers
* Financial information, including bank account numbers, bank routing number, credit or debit card numbers, tax number, credit score, bankruptcy status, income, net worth or how much debt someone has
* Government-issue identifiers, including social security numbers, passport numbers, driver license’s numbers or state identification cards
* Insurance information, including current insurance policy numbers or other details about a person’s insurance
* Usernames and passwords
* Citizen or immigration status
* Marital status
* Relationship status
* Military status

Advertisers should not collect personal data that is not covered in [Pinterest Privacy Policy](https://policy.pinterest.com/privacy-policy). If you are unclear whether certain information is covered under the Privacy Policy, please reach out to [privacy-legal@pinterest.com](mailto:privacy-legal@pinterest.com).

For Pinterest lead ads:

Advertisers promoting Pharmacy (Rx), Over-the-Counter (OTC) products, health-related apps (e.g., heart rate, weight), and/or Telehealth Services are prohibited from using lead ads.

Advertisers must have a legitimate business reason for collecting personal data from Pinners in a lead ad and must respect the data minimization principle (i.e. limit the collection of personal data to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose). For example:

* It is allowed to:
    * Ask for a Pinner’s date of birth or age to advertise an alcoholic beverage; or
    * Ask for a Pinner’s home address to mail product samples
* It is _not_ allowed to:
    * Ask for a Pinner’s date of birth and age. Age can be calculated with an Pinner’s date of birth, so collecting both data elements would not respect the data minimization principle; or
    * Ask for a Pinner’s home address to mail them disclosures, statements or invoices required in the event the Pinner becomes a customer of the advertiser. In this instance, the advertiser will have an opportunity to collect the Pinner’s home address when said Pinner becomes a customer of the advertiser

Advertisers must not ask via a lead ad for the following information:

* Sensitive health or medical condition, including related to genetics, fertility or pregnancy
* Race, color or ethnic origin
* Personal hardship, including financial, physical and emotional hardship
* Religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation
* Sexual behavior or orientation
* Alleged or actual commission of a crime
* Trade union membership or affiliation
* Political affiliation or opinions
* Pinners under 18 years old
* Precise geolocation (e.g. GPS)
* Account numbers, including frequent flyer numbers, loyalty card numbers, cable or telephone account numbers
* Financial information, including bank account numbers, bank routing number, credit or debit card numbers, tax number, credit score, bankruptcy status, income, net worth or how much debt someone has
* Government-issue identifiers, including social security numbers, passport numbers, driver license’s numbers or state identification cards
* Insurance information, including current insurance policy numbers or other details about a person’s insurance
* Usernames and passwords
* Citizen or immigration status
* Marital status
* Relationship status
* Military status

Be thoughtful with your editorial
=================================

To keep ads inspiring and actionable, we set high standards for the editorial quality of ads on Pinterest. For tips, check out our creative [best practices](https://business.pinterest.com/creative-best-practices) and [boards from The Studio](https://www.pinterest.com/thestudio/ideas-we-helped-make/).

#### Professional and neatly edited images

Ads should adhere to the highest levels of editorial quality. We don’t allow ads with:

* Fuzzy, blurry, or grainy images (try at least 600x900 pixels)
* Images with text that is too small or blurry to read
* Incorrectly oriented images (upside down or sideways)
* Poorly edited images or poorly cropped images
* Overly busy images that are packed with text overlay or have too many font styles and colors (try no more than 4 frames and 2 font styles or colors)
* Images with artificial functionality like play or download buttons, notification icons, search bars, or elements that mimic Pinterest features (like our Save or Buy buttons)
* Elements that mimic Pinterest features (like our buttons or ellipses)
* Improper grammar, incorrect spelling or excessive capitalization and symbols
* Low-quality user-generated content like selfies and screenshots
* Ads with flashing or strobing effects

#### Quality landing pages

We care about the ad experience from start to finish—including the URL your ad links to. We want to make sure users find what they're looking for when they click through. We don’t allow landing pages that:

* Require people to take an action (like signing up) before they can see certain content unless your ad makes it clear that this is required
* Have pop-up ads or start automatic downloads on someone’s device
* Force people to visit another page
* Contain primarily advertising content (made-for-ads sites)
* Lead to inconsistent experiences

#### Create a consistent experience

Your ads must reflect who you are and what you're promoting, so make sure your ad image, description and landing page are consistent. Your ads can't suggest or imply that a product is available on your landing page if you don't actually offer that product.

Be responsible with your content
================================

We don’t allow certain categories of advertising and restrict others. As always, you're responsible for the content you promote on Pinterest, as well as the safety and trustworthiness of the products and services you offer.

Keep in mind...
===============

You need to make sure your ads follow our standard ad guidelines and any country-specific guidelines. You need to follow all applicable local laws, regulations and industry codes, and obtain any necessary permits or permissions for any area your ads will be shown in. Pinterest reserves the right to request these permits/permissions should we require them. You must also follow our community guidelines, terms and the above advertising guidelines, including our targeting guidelines. These advertising guidelines apply to all parts of your promoted content, including the image, description and destination—and they also apply to targeting features like keyword and audience targeting.

We reserve the right to reject or remove any ad that negatively affects our relationship with people on Pinterest or that goes against our interests. We may also remove ads, categories of ads, or advertisers that get lots of negative feedback from people on Pinterest. These rules may change at any time.

Advertising guidelines enforcement
==================================

We believe promoted content can play a big role in helping people create a life they love, which is why we want ads to be some of the best stuff you see on Pinterest. To that end, our team manually reviews some ads before allowing them to be shown to Pinners — though some ads may be reviewed automatically. For example, our systems may automatically review and approve an ad if it’s submitted by an advertiser with a history of policy compliance.

When we become aware of a violation of our Advertising guidelines, we’ll take action:

* **Rejection**: When an advertisement is rejected, it will not be shown to Pinners. We may reject an ad before ever showing it to anyone, or after the campaign has already begun to run - for example, in response to a report from a Pinner who saw the ad;
* **Limited approval**: Limited approval means that an ad may run, but with restrictions - for example, it may only be shown to people in certain regions or to people over a certain age; and/or
* **Advertiser removal**: When we remove an advertiser, they no longer have access to Pinterest’s advertising tools. This doesn’t affect their ability to use other Pinterest products, though.

You can read our full Advertising guidelines [here](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines).
