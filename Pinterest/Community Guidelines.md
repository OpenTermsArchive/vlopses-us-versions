Our mission
===========

Pinterest's mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. That being said, not all content is inspiring - so we have community guidelines to outline what we do and don’t allow on Pinterest. These guidelines are our acceptable use policy, so if you find content that shouldn’t be on Pinterest, please [report it to us](https://help.pinterest.com/article/report-something-on-pinterest). We appreciate your feedback and work hard to review your report and take appropriate action in a timely fashion. We use your reports to learn and evolve our standards, and work with subject matter experts to inform and update our guidelines. You can learn more about how we enforce these guidelines in our biannual [transparency report](https://policy.pinterest.com/transparency-report).

Content safety
==============

Pinterest isn’t a place for antagonistic, explicit, false or misleading, harmful, hateful, or violent content or behavior. We may remove, limit, or block the distribution of such content and the accounts, individuals, groups and domains that create or spread it based on how much harm it poses. Our policies apply to everyone and to all types of content, including synthetically generated content.

We do not allow accounts that belong to violent actors, hate groups or malicious misinformation actors. We may consider off-platform actions in assessing enforcement against a Pinterest account belonging to one of these groups or associated individuals.

You can read more about how we put our Community Guidelines into practice on our Enforcement page [here](https://policy.pinterest.com/enforcement).

We’re committed to presenting you with clear and transparent expectations that are easy to understand and follow. If you have questions or encounter problems on Pinterest, please [contact us](https://help.pinterest.com/contact?page=about_you_page).

### Child safety

Pinterest does not tolerate child sexual exploitation of any kind. That means we enforce a strict, zero-tolerance policy for any content or accounts that might exploit or endanger minors. Pinterest prohibits not just illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM), but goes a step further to prohibit any content that contributes to the sexualization of minors, including in imagery and text. We also work closely with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to combat this type of activity, and report content violations ​​as required under the law. The types of content we remove includes:

    * Facilitating unsolicited contact with minors or inviting a minor to engage in a sexual act, meet in person, connect off-platform, or share sexual images.

* The intentional misuse of otherwise non-violating content depicting minors. For example, we will deactivate users who save otherwise non-violating content into collections or in other contexts that suggest the intent is sexualization of minors.

In addition to enforcing strict policies for content or accounts that may exploit or endanger minors, Pinterest strives to provide minors with safe, age-appropriate experiences on our services. These efforts include:

Spam
====

We want the inspiration and ideas on Pinterest to be high-quality and useful, so we remove spam when we find it. We ask that you be considerate of others' experiences on Pinterest and don't spread spam or engage in spammy behavior.

Our guidelines around spam are:

* Don't use automation that hasn't been explicitly approved by Pinterest. This includes unauthorized services that automatically perform actions on your behalf. You can find information on approved partner tools on our [Partners website](https://business.pinterest.com/pinterest-partners).
* Don't create or operate accounts that aren't authentic, create accounts en masse, or create new accounts for the purpose of violating these guidelines.
* Don't create or save content that is repetitive, deceptive, or irrelevant in an attempt to make money. To learn how to make great Pins, you can always refer to our [creative best practices](https://business.pinterest.com/creative-best-practices).
* In general, don't attempt to make money from Pinners or Pinner web traffic in ways that are misleading, detract from the Pinner experience, or don't add value for Pinners.
* Don't link to websites that are unsafe, deceptive, untrustworthy, unoriginal, or that facilitate or encourage spam. Websites should have original content that adds unique value for Pinners.
* Don't send repeated, unsolicited messages, especially if your messages are commercial or deceptive in nature.
* Don’t make repetitive or irrelevant comments. Comments should be authentic and original. We also ask that you be kind to others by keeping your commentary respectful and constructive.
* Don't operate multiple accounts or coordinate with other people with the purpose of manipulating the Pinterest platform.
* Don’t use any other unscrupulous tactics to attempt to improperly influence distribution, clicks, or other metrics, including: buying or selling engagement, "stuffing" irrelevant keywords, generating inauthentic traffic, or redirecting existing Pins to new destinations.
* Don't attempt to evade our anti-spam systems. For example, don’t use redirection to attempt to link to a site that is not permitted on Pinterest.
    * With respect to redirection, we encourage you to follow a “no surprises” principle — Pinners should be able to reasonably anticipate where your link will take them. Links that exhibit excessive or deceptive redirection, as well as shortener services that are abused for spam, may be blocked.

Community guidelines enforcement
================================

Not everything on the internet is inspiring, so we have [Community Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines) to outline what we do and don’t allow on Pinterest. The following explains how we enforce those guidelines.

When we become aware of a violation of our Community Guidelines, we’ll take action:

* **Deactivation**: When we deactivate content - such as Pins, boards, comments or user accounts - that content is no longer available to anyone on the platform. Deactivation can also be referred to as “removal;” or
* **Limiting distribution**: When we limit the distribution of a Pin, board or account, it will continue to be accessible on Pinterest to the user who posted it and to users with a direct link, but it won’t be featured in recommendation or discovery surfaces, such as search results or the home feed.

We determine whether content should be removed or limited in distribution based on how much risk of harm it poses, particularly the severity of its impact and the vulnerability of its target. Depending on the context, we may allow content that would typically be deactivated for violating our Community Guidelines to instead remain on Pinterest, but we limit its distribution so that people don’t come across it accidentally. For example, we may limit distribution of content where the context is acceptable (such as condemnation or education).

We may limit or remove boards or accounts for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or when they are dedicated to a policy violation. We may also remove an account after a single instance of a severe policy violation or if we determine that the account has repeatedly posted illegal content. If we limit or remove a board or account, that action applies to all of the Pins contained on the board or account. For example, if we limit the distribution of a board, all of the Pins on that board will also be limited in distribution. In addition, boards whose distribution has been limited will not be visible when viewing someone else’s profile. If we deactivate an entire account, all of the content (Pins and boards) on that account also are deactivated. In certain circumstances, before an account is deactivated, we may place additional restrictions on its use of Pinterest, such as limiting the account’s ability to post or save content. You can read more about account removals (also known as deactivations or suspensions), [here](https://help.pinterest.com/article/account-suspension).

We strive to help Pinners find content that is inspirational, relevant and safe. Content that our systems predict may not meet those criteria may be shown less often or less prominently, even if we haven't determined that the content necessarily goes against our Community Guidelines. We may also implement additional product features to improve a Pinner’s experience. For example, we may apply a sensitivity screen in situations where our systems indicate that content might not be appropriate for all audiences. We may also limit certain features on Pins, such as turning off comments or not showing related content, when we think they may be unsafe or when appropriate to protect minors.
