**How to use the Pinterest brand in your marketing**
====================================================

**Interactive call to action lockup guidance**

**No container**

**Gray container over white**

**White container**

**Static call to action lockup guidance**  
Follow these guidedlines for any static, non-interactive CTAs that link people to your Pinterest profile. If your audience is more familiar with Pinterest, you can simply use your Pinterest account handle. If your audince isn’t as familiar with Pinterest, you might want to write out your full account URL for clearer context. In all cases you may use your own brand typeface.

**Centered CTA**  
Pinterest badge centered above a CTA and your account handle

**Left-aligned CTA**  
Pinterest badge set to the left of a CTA and your account handle

**Centered account URL**  
Pinterest badge centered above full account URL

**Left-aligned account URL**  
Pinterest badge set to the left of a CTA and your account handle.  
Note: The CTA does should not mention “Pinterest” as it is included within the URL.

**Account URL only**  
Your full Pinterest URL may appear without our badge.

**CTA and account URL**  
A CTA and full account URL may appear without our badge.  
 Note: The CTA should not mention “Pinterest,” as it is already included within the URL.

Broadcast and social

Broadcast and social lockups should always include clear links to your Pinterest profile. Use of our badge without a link to your own account incorrectly implies a partnership, sponsorship or endorsement.  
  
To use Pinterest in video, television or film, you must submit a written request to your partner manager at Pinterest. The partner manager needs to review each potential use. Please reach out at least 10 business days in advance to avoid production delays.

Centered lockups are recommended for all social and broadcast formats.

Language

**Acceptable call to action phrases**  
 Our primary call to action is “Follow on Pinterest.” You can also use the following phrases to talk about your account:  
  
Follow us on Pinterest  
Popular on Pinterest  
Find us on Pinterest  
Visit us on Pinterest  
Find more ideas on Pinterest  
Get inspired on Pinterest  
  
**Unacceptable phrases**  
Never use any of the following phrases when referring to Pinterest:  
  
Trending on Pinterest  
Trending Pins  
Any phrase that uses “Pin” as a verb (use “save” instead)  
  
**When can you say “Popular on Pinterest?”**  
A Pin is only considered popular if it registers high impressions, clicks or saves within Pinterest Analytics. Remember that Pinterest Analytics only shows your own Pin performance. To provide the right context, make sure to put your own Pinterest URL after any “Popular on Pinterest” labels.  
  
**Naming and visuals for your apps and services**  
If you’re creating an app, website or other service designed to be used with Pinterest, develop your own branding that doesn’t use Pinterest brand elements.

Don’t use “Pin,” “Pinterest” or any variations of “Pinterest” in your name or domain name.

Don’t use any Pinterest marks, logos, graphics or similar variations as part of your logo or branding.

Product depictions

When depicting Pinterest in your marketing, always make sure the interface matches the device. For example: when depicting Pinterest within a photo of a phone, make sure you’re using the mobile Pinterest interface. The same applies for tablet and desktop depictions. This applies to all elements of Pinterest, including Pins, boards, the grid view or any other element.  
  
Please note that you are responsible for obtaining all rights to any imagery represented in your marketing materials.

Trademark


=============

Pinterest respects the trademark rights of others and expects Pinners to do the same. Pinterest may disable access to content that misleads others or violates another's trademark rights. Pinterest may also suspend or terminate users who post or share such content. In addition, Pinterest may transfer usernames as appropriate.

If you're concerned that someone may be using your trademark in an infringing way on Pinterest, let us know by submitting a trademark infringement report via our [easy-to-use and online form](https://www.pinterest.com/about/trademark/). We'll review your submission and take appropriate action.

While the trademark infringement report form is the best way to reach us with your concerns, you can also email us at [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com).

If your content is removed based on a trademark infringement report, you can contest it by emailing [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com) and by letting us know why you think the report is invalid. Please include the trademark infringement report reference number. If you want us to forward the information from the trademark infringement report, let us know by emailing [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com) with the trademark complaint reference number. We'll be happy to send it along (though we may remove personal contact information).

It’s our policy—in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion—to suspend or terminate the accounts of people who repeatedly infringe trademark rights or are repeatedly charged with infringing trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Actions against such users may also include temporary suspension of their ability to post content, among other things.

Submit a Trademark Infringement Report
======================================

To submit a trademark infringement report, you can fill out our online form.

Fill out trademark complaint form

If you'd prefer not to use this form, please send the following information to [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com):

*   Your full legal name and your electronic or physical signature (for example, by typing your full name).
*   Identification of the trademark(s) you believe are infringed (e.g., provide a trademark registration number or materials demonstrating common law trademark rights).
*   The content on Pinterest you claim to be infringing your rights, including the information we need to help us find it, like the URL to the content (Pin, board or account) on Pinterest.
*   Explanation of why you believe the reported content infringes your trademark rights.
*   A declaration that:
    *   You have a good faith belief that use of the trademarks described in your report infringes your trademark(s) or the trademark(s) of an owner you represent.
    *   You represent that the information in your report is true and correct.
    *   Under penalty of perjury, you own the trademark(s) allegedly infringed, or are expressly authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.
    *   You understand that a copy of the report may be sent to the user responsible for the content reported.
*   Your mailing address, phone number, and email address.

Appeal a Trademark Infringement Report
======================================

If you believe a Pin was removed in error, or that the trademark owner was mistaken in some respect (e.g., you contend your Pin does not infringe the reporter’s trademark rights, or the reporter does not own the trademark), you may contest the report by emailing [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com). To submit an appeal, please provide:

*   A statement explaining that you have a good faith belief that your use of the trademark is non-infringing and the basis for that belief
*   A statement that you understand that a copy of the appeal may be sent to the current account holder(s) impacted by your appeal
*   Your name, address, and telephone number
*   A statement that the information in your appeal is accurate  
      
    

Anti-Counterfeiting on Pinterest
================================

Pinterest prohibits users from selling or promoting the sale of counterfeit goods on Pinterest. Counterfeit goods are goods that are promoted, sold, or distributed using a trademark that is identical to, or substantially indistinguishable from, another’s trademark, without authorization from the trademark owner.

If you believe content on Pinterest is selling or promoting counterfeits,, you can submit a counterfeiting report using our easy-to-use and online form. You can also report alleged counterfeiting by emailing us at [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com).

We'll review your submission and take appropriate action.

If your content is removed based on a counterfeit report, you can contest it by emailing [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com) and by letting us know why you think the report is invalid. Please include the report reference number. If you want us to forward the information from the report, let us know by emailing [trademark@pinterest.com](mailto:trademark@pinterest.com) with the report reference number. We'll be happy to send it along (though we may remove personal contact information).

It’s our policy—in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion—to suspend or terminate users found to engage in blatant or repeated counterfeiting. Users whose content is removed for violating our counterfeit policy may also have additional consequences, such as having access to certain services or programs revoked (e.g., advertising privileges, merchant and verified merchant programs).
