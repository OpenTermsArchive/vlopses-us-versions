Merchant guidelines


=======================

Our mission
===========

Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. We believe that when people find great products from trusted merchants, it can empower them to do things they care about.

General merchant guidelines
===========================

While Pinterest is not involved in facilitating the purchase, sale or delivery of goods, we want people to have good experiences shopping for products they find on Pinterest. We want merchants to offer the best customer service possible, and that includes setting clear expectations about product quality, price, delivery times and return processes. And, of course, we want merchants to meet those expectations.

Merchants are responsible for making sure they follow all relevant laws, regulations and industry codes when they use our service. Merchants are also responsible for handling and responding to all purchases, deliveries, customer service questions, complaints, problems and disputes.

On an ongoing basis, we manage invite-only programs or limited tests allowing some merchants to access features that may not be available to everyone. We reserve the right to iterate on the tests and feature availability at any time to ensure the best shopping solutions for Pinners.

We reserve the right to remove product Pins for violating these guidelines and to shut down feed access from any merchant based on poor third-party ratings or on platform signals such as a record of complaints. We may remove anything for any reason, including Pins, boards or your access to Pinterest.

Merchant requirements
=====================

Merchants must meet the following criteria:

*   Merchants must not be affiliate marketers.
*   Merchants must not be wholesale retailers.
*   The merchant must have an easy to find and clear return policy that displays whether the merchant accepts returns, the process and time expectations for returns, and contact information.
*   Merchants must have a high-quality website and product pages. We don’t allow websites that:
    *   Have poor editorial content, including broken links or incomplete pages

Product requirements
====================

To qualify as a product to be used in a Pin or in other formats on Pinterest, it must meet the following criteria:

*   Products must follow our [community guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines) and [terms of service](https://policy.pinterest.com/terms-of-service).
*   Pinterest must have current (within seven days) and accurate information about the price and in-stock status of the product. This is obtained from daily feed syncing or allowing Pinterest to frequently scrape meta-tags on product landing pages.
