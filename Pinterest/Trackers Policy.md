Cookies on Pinterest
====================

Our [privacy policy](https://policy.pinterest.com/privacy-policy) describes how we collect and use information, and what choices you have. One way we collect information is through the use of a technology called “cookies", and similar technologies, such as pixels, local storage and software development kits (SDKs). We use cookies for all kinds of things on Pinterest.

What’s a cookie
===============

In real life, it’s a delicious baked good. You can find lots of delicious cookie recipes on Pinterest.

  
  
But in technology, a cookie is something completely different. When you go online, you use a program called a “browser” (like Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome). Most websites store a small amount of text in the browser—and that text is called a “cookie.” Other technologies function similarly to collect data about your browsing activity. Learn more about other technologies in the [Help Center](https://help.pinterest.com/article/other-technologies-like-cookies). This policy refers to these technologies collectively as “cookies.”

We use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we use persistent cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest.

  
  
Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Pinterest account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not.  
  

How we use cookies
==================

There are four categories of cookies we may use:

* **Essential cookies** are required so Pinterest works in the way you expect. Examples of these types of cookies are login cookies which keep you logged in as you scroll through Pinterest or search for Pins.
* **Analytics cookies** which are used for internal analytics and include cookies from providers like [Google Analytics](https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/third-party-analytics-or-advertising-providers-pinterest-uses-or-allows).
* **Personalization cookies** for customizing content, including ads.
* **Marketing cookies** which are used for advertising Pinterest to you off of Pinterest.

What we do with the cookies in each category
============================================

#### Essential cookies

* We may use essential cookies to remember your settings and preferences, like the language you prefer and your privacy settings.
* Essential cookies let you log in and out of Pinterest.
* Essential cookies are just one way we protect you from security risks. For example, we use them to detect when someone might be trying to hack your Pinterest account or spam the Pinterest community.

#### Analytics cookies

* We use analytics cookies to make Pinterest better. For example, these cookies tell us how many people use a certain feature and how popular it is, or whether people open an email we send.
* We also use cookies to help advertisers understand who sees and interacts with their ads, and who visits their website or purchases their products.
* Sometimes we hire security vendors or use third-party analytics providers to help us understand how people are using Pinterest. Just like we do, these providers may use cookies. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/third-party-analytics-or-advertising-providers-pinterest-uses-or-allows) about the third-party providers we use.

#### Personalization cookies

* We may use cookies to help us remember your preferences, or which Pins, boards, people or websites you’ve interacted with so we can show you related content you might like.
* We may also use cookies to help an advertising service we partner with show you interesting ads. For example, if you bought a tent from an advertiser that uses a Pinterest partner’s service, they could ask us to show you an ad for a camping stove. If you’d like to opt-out of these services you can do so in your [settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/privacy).

#### Marketing cookies

* Sometimes we hire advertising vendors so that we can market Pinterest products on other websites and apps. These providers may use cookies to provide this service to us. If you’d like to opt-out of these services you can do so in your [settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/privacy).

Where we use cookies
====================

We use cookies on pinterest.com, in our mobile applications, and in our products and services (like ads, emails and applications). We also use them on the websites of partners who use Pinterest’s [Save button](https://help.pinterest.com/article/save-pins-with-the-pinterest-browser-button), Pinterest widgets or ad tools like conversion tracking.

Your options
============

There are a few ways you can choose how cookies are used on Pinterest:

If you’re located in the EU or UK you can adjust your cookie preferences at any time by visiting your [Privacy settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/privacy/) and editing your Cookies Preferences. If you’ve consented to a category of non-essential cookies and later change your mind, you can immediately revoke consent by turning off that cookie category in your settings.

  
  
In the Personalization section of [your settings](https://www.pinterest.com/settings/), you can decide whether we use info from our partners and other services to personalize Pinterest for you or whether we use information we learn about you on Pinterest to market Pinterest to you on other sites and apps. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/personalization-and-data) about your options in the Help Center.

  
  
There are also online tools such as [Digital Advertising Alliance's Browser Check](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) site which allow you to choose how cookies are used throughout the web based on the device and browser you are using.

  
  
Your browser probably gives you cookie choices. For example, most browsers let you block “third-party cookies,” which are cookies from sites other than the one you’re visiting. Those options vary from browser to browser, so check your browser settings for more info.

  
  
Some browsers also have a privacy setting called “Do Not Track,” which we support. This setting is another way for you to decide whether we use info from our partners and other services to customize Pinterest for you. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/articles/we-support-do-not-track) in the Help Center.

Finally, your mobile device has settings that allow you to control how ad partners can use information about your use of mobile applications to show ads to you. On Android devices, this setting is called “Opt out of Ads Personalization.” On Apple devices you can adjust your choice by selecting Privacy and then Tracking. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/personalization-and-data) in the Help Center.
