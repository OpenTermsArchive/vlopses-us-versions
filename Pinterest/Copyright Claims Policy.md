Copyright


=============

Pinterest respects the intellectual property rights of others and we expect people on Pinterest to do the same.

In keeping with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which you can read at the US Copyright Office website, we’ll respond quickly to claims of copyright infringement on Pinterest that are reported to our designated copyright agent, identified below.

If you’re a copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of one, you can report alleged copyright infringements on Pinterest by completing a copyright report and sending it to our designated copyright agent.

When we get your copyright report, we’ll take appropriate action, which may include disabling or removing access to the reported content on Pinterest.

If we disable or remove access to content in response to a copyright infringement report , we may notify the person who saved it on Pinterest so they have the opportunity to send a counter notification. We may also send a complete copy of the notice to others, as appropriate.

Submit a copyright infringement report
======================================

To submit a copyright infringement report, just fill out our copyright reporting form.

Fill out copyright complaint form

If you'd prefer not to use this form, please send the following information to our designated copyright agent:

1\. Identification of the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.  
  
2\. Identification of the content on Pinterest you claim to be infringing your rights, including the information we need to help us find it, like the URL to the content on Pinterest.  
  
3\. Your mailing address, phone number and email address.  
  
4\. Both of these statements in the body of your notice:

* "I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material or reference or link to such material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (for example, as a fair use)."
* "I hereby state that the information in this notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that I’m the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the copyright that’s allegedly infringed."

5\. Your full legal name and your electronic or physical signature (for example, by typing your full name).

If the work you’re reporting is an image, you can ask us to remove all copies of the image. At the beginning of your report, just ask us to “remove all Pins that contain the image.” Please note that we can only remove identical copies of an image—if an image file has been resized or altered, we won’t be able to find or remove it.

Send your completed copyright report to:

This email address should only be used for copyright infringement reports. If you need to get in touch with us for any other reason, please visit our Help Center.

Note: There are potential legal and financial consequences for fraudulent or bad faith copyright infringement reports. Before submitting a copyright report, make sure you have a good faith belief that the content reported is infringing, including a consideration of fair use, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false report.

What if my content is removed based on a copyright infringement report?
=======================================================================

If you’ve received a notification that your content has been removed based on a copyright infringement report, it means the copyright owner submitted a complete and valid report asking us to remove it. If you want us to forward the information from that copyright report, just email us at [copyright@pinterest.com](mailto:copyright@pinterest.com) to let us know (we may remove some personal contact information).

If your account gets content removed based on too many copyright infringement reports, you could lose the ability to save Pins on Pinterest, or we may disable your account altogether.

If you think we made a mistake removing your Pin, you can file a counter notification. When we get a valid counter notification, we’ll reinstate the content and remove the complaint from your account's record.

Note: There are potential legal and financial consequences for fraudulent or bad faith counter notifications. Before submitting a counter notification, make sure you have a good faith belief that we removed the content in error, and that you understand the repercussions of false submissions.

How to file a counter notification
==================================

If your content is removed as the result of a copyright infringement report, you’ll receive instructions about how to file a counter notification in the email notification we send you. Please note that you should only submit a counter notification if you believe that the content was removed in error.

When we receive a valid counter notification, we’ll forward it to the party that reported that content. The information they receive will include your contact information, which they may use to contact you directly or to take further action they find appropriate.

If we provide your counter notification to the party that reported the content, and they do not notify us that they have filed an action in court or before the Copyright Claims Board seeking an order to keep the content down, we will reinstate the content. This process can take up to 14 business days.

Repeat infringers
=================

It’s our policy—in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion—to disable or terminate the accounts of people who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing copyrights or other intellectual property rights. Users whose Pins are removed pursuant to a copyright infringement notification receive strikes towards Pinterest’s repeat infringer policy.

Appeal a copyright strike
=========================

If one of your Pins was removed based on a copyright infringement report and you cannot, or do not want to, make the representations necessary to submit a counter notification but think that circumstances warrant removing a copyright strike, you can provide detail on the circumstances by appealing a copyright strike. We will review your appeal and take appropriate action.

Content Claiming Portal
=======================

In addition to our copyright reporting channels, Pinterest also offers the Content Claiming Portal, a tool that enables creators to claim their content and decide if and how it appears on Pinterest.

Anyone who owns exclusive copyright to content can [apply](https://www.pinterest.com/about/content-claiming/application/) for access to the Content Claiming Portal. We review applications to see if the rights holder is a good fit for the tool. If an application is approved, the rights holder will be able to upload their original content and tell us whether they want the content to appear on Pinterest or not. Their selected enforcement will apply to both existing matches and future matches added to Pinterest.
