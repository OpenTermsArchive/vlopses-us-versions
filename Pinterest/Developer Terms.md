Developer guidelines


========================

Our mission
===========

At Pinterest, our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. As a developer, you can play an important role in making that happen. These are the guidelines for what we do and don’t allow when building applications and services with the Pinterest Materials. We require developers to follow these guidelines as well as our other terms and policies, such as our [Developer and API Terms of Service](https://developers.pinterest.com/terms/) and our [Community Guidelines](http://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines).

If we remove your app for violating our guidelines, we will notify you. If you come across a developer application that is in violation of our guidelines, please [let us know](https://help.pinterest.com/contact).  
  

The basics
==========

No matter what your application will do, you must follow these fundamental principles:

* Be honest and transparent with Pinterest and with your end users about the functions and features of your service. Don’t confuse, mislead, or surprise anyone.
* Except for campaign analytics information accessed about your account, you may not store any information accessed through any Pinterest Materials including the API. Instead, call the API each time you need to access information.
* Only access someone's account with authorization, for example by using an access token. Do not solicit or collect login credentials or use login credentials to access other people’s accounts or take actions on their behalf.
* Only use information from someone’s account to provide services to that person.
* Don't combine someone's account information with information from other people's accounts or with information from other services.
* Don't share or sell information from our API with a third party, including another advertising service. (It's okay to share information with the person from whose account that information came.)
* Keep your API access credentials private. Do not use someone else’s API credentials, and do not allow anyone else to use yours.
    * End users may request API access credentials for use with a “bring-your-own-key” application, as long as the application stores the end user’s API credentials locally (not server-side) and the application complies with all other policies and guidelines. For example, the application must not solicit Pinterest user passwords, session cookies, etc.
* Don’t try to evade our policy enforcement systems. For example, if we remove your app, don’t try to reconnect the same or a substantially similar app using a different account or under a different name.
* Follow any instructions in our technical documentation.
* You must have a privacy policy that’s consistent with all applicable laws. You’ll need to include a link to your privacy policy when you apply for API access.

What to do
==========

Acceptable uses of the Pinterest Materials such as our developer tools and APIs include building integrations such as:

* Advertising tools, like apps for managing campaigns across multiple channels
* Audience tools, which help advertisers use advanced targeting features
* Content marketing tools, like Pin schedulers
* Creative tools, like apps for designing images or editing video
* Creator platforms, like those that facilitate collaboration between Creators and brands
* Dynamic creative tools, like apps that automate the creation of content
* Feed management tools, which help end users optimize their product listings
* Merchant platforms, like those that host ecommerce stores
* Measurement tools, which can help advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns
* Shoppable experience tools, like those that allow users to purchase items shown in your content

You can browse our [Partners site](https://business.pinterest.com/pinterest-partners/) to learn more about some of the existing integrations that developers have built on the Pinterest Platform. Our [Developers site](https://developers.pinterest.com/) contains documentation to help you get started as well as best practices for working with the Pinterest Platform.  
  

What not to do
==============

Unacceptable uses of the Pinterest Materials such as our developer tools and APIs include:

* Creating or providing an app for the purpose of violating Pinterest policies.
* Taking actions on behalf of end users without their specific knowledge and consent. This includes but is not limited to actions like: modifying Pinner profiles; creating, saving and editing Pins; following and unfollowing; sending messages; and making comments.
* Offering features that enable end users to automatically initiate actions without specifically considering each action.
    * For example, if your app allows end users to schedule Pin publishing, the end user must choose each Pin to be published. Similarly, if your app allows end users to follow accounts on Pinterest, the end user must choose each account to follow.
    * Put simply, end users are responsible for the actions that they take on Pinterest, and we want those actions to be genuine—so don't build automations that could lessen the authenticity of engagement on Pinterest or lead end users to perform an action that they didn't understand or intend.
* Attempting or claiming to provide platform insights, benchmarking, or competitor research features unless you have explicit written authorization from Pinterest. For example, don’t make statements about Pinterest’s overall performance related to a competitor or to industry benchmarks, and don’t do the same for brands or accounts.
* Using any automated means or form of scraping or data extraction to access information from Pinterest, except as expressly permitted by Pinterest.
* Misrepresenting your relationship with Pinterest or your level of access to the Pinterest Materials.
* Using information from Pinterest to target people with advertising outside of Pinterest, whether directly or bundled with third-party data. For example, do not bundle or sell content or data from Pinterest on other advertising networks, via data brokers, or through any other advertising or monetization service.
* Using your API access or developer tools to test Pinterest’s rate limits or other abuse prevention systems without specific authorization from Pinterest.
* Offering any feature to circumvent Pinterest restrictions. For example, don’t offer a feature that would allow end users in a region to access content that Pinterest has restricted from that region (a.k.a. geoblocked).
* Requiring or incentivizing engagement. For example, don’t require end users to create or save a Pin to a certain website, or to save a certain Pin in exchange for a benefit.
* Attempting to evade our consent mechanisms but gathering your own user consent for API-provided information.
* Apps intended for children under the age of 13 are not permitted.  
      
    

Publishing content
==================

If your app publishes content from Pinterest, you must:

* Link Pins back to their source on Pinterest (e.g. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/424605071126047814/), and make sure it’s clear that the content comes from Pinterest.
* Not cover or obscure content from Pinterest. For example, don’t apply filters to Pins.
* Not create new content from Pins that can be distributed on your app or service.  
      
    

Audience & advertiser services
==============================

If you provide audience onboarding, you must comply in particular with the user consent obligations and data restrictions in the [Ad Data Terms](https://policy.pinterest.com/ad-data-terms) and [Advertising Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines).

If advertisers will use data you’ve provided to them for online behavioral advertising, you also need to:

* Give clear and prominent notice to everyone you collect data from letting them know that their information will be shared with third parties for online behavioral advertising, and gather any necessary consents.
* Give instructions on how to opt out of the use of their information for online behavioral advertising, for example through the AdChoices website optout.aboutads.info.
* Not send Pinterest information about people who've opted out or not opted in.
* Regularly update data to remove people who've opted out.

If you use information from any Pinterest API to provide an advertising service, you must comply with our [Ad Data Terms](https://policy.pinterest.com/ad-data-terms) and [Advertising Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines), and also do the following:

* If you report last-click attribution metrics, next to them with equal prominence you must show multi-touch metrics that divide attribution equally among each attributed service.
* Clearly and separately show the fees you charge for Pinterest advertising and the fees that Pinterest charges (both the absolute amount and by billing metrics, like CPM or CPC), and don't combine your fees with ours.
* Don't use information from our API except to serve and evaluate the performance of ads on Pinterest.  
      
    

Regarding app abuse
===================

We want developer applications to help everyone find the inspiration to create a life they love. Apps created for abuse (for example, apps created to spread spam) are not permitted. In addition, we expect developers to be responsible partners in abuse prevention and to take steps to mitigate the risk of their app being used in harmful ways by end users. This includes, for example, not offering features that facilitate spamming Pinterest or other users. We may remove apps in order to protect Pinners at any time.

You are not restricted from disclosing Confidential Information if required by law if you provide reasonable advance notice, unless a court orders that no notice be given.

7\. Indemnity
-------------

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pinterest and our respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees (including costs of defence of claims, suits, or proceedings brought by third parties), in any way related to (a) your access to or use of our Pinterest Data, APIs, Developer Features or Developer Tools, (b) your access to or use of User Content, or (c) your breach of any of these Terms.

8\. Disclaimers
---------------

Our Materials including Pinterest Data, APIs, Developer Features, Developer Tools, and all content on Pinterest is provided on an “as is” basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.

PINTEREST SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

Pinterest takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other user or third party posts, sends or accesses using our Materials or Service. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.

If you are a consumer in the EEA, we don’t exclude or limit any liability for gross negligence, intent, or death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.

9\. Limitation of Liability.
----------------------------

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PINTEREST SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES. IN NO EVENT SHALL PINTEREST’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (US $100).

To the extent that any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Pinterest or our Materials isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Pinterest both agree that any claim or dispute regarding Pinterest will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 11 of these Terms.

If we cause damage to you and you are a consumer in the EEA, the above doesn’t apply. Instead, Pinterest’s liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Pinterest isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability won’t apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you.

10\. Arbitration.
-----------------

For any dispute you have with Pinterest, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address associated with your Pinterest account. If Pinterest has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of, connected to or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service through binding, individual arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in small claims court. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their forms at www.adr.org. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Pinterest will reimburse you for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorised access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND PINTEREST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU. To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Pinterest or our Service isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Pinterest both agree that any claim or dispute regarding Pinterest will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 11 of these Terms.

If you are a consumer in the EEA, this Section 10 doesn't apply to you.

11\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
-----------------------------------

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If you are a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is San Francisco County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and our dispute will be determined under California law.

If you are a consumer in the EEA, this won’t deprive you of any protection you have under the law of the country where you live and access to the courts in that country.

12\. General Terms
------------------

* Notification procedures and changes to these Terms.

Developer Guidelines
====================

(also available at: [https://policy.pinterest.com/developer-guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/developer-guidelines))

Our mission
-----------

At Pinterest, our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. As a developer, you can play an important role in making that happen. These are the guidelines for what we do and don’t allow when building applications and services with the Pinterest Materials. We require developers to follow these guidelines as well as our other terms and policies, such as our [Developer and API Terms of Service](https://developers.pinterest.com/terms/) and our [Community Guidelines](http://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines).

If we remove your app for violating our guidelines, we will notify you. If you come across a developer application that is in violation of our guidelines, please [let us know](https://help.pinterest.com/contact).

The basics
----------

No matter what your application will do, you must follow these fundamental principles:

* Be honest and transparent with Pinterest and with your end users about the functions and features of your service. Don’t confuse, mislead, or surprise anyone.

* Except for campaign analytics information accessed about your account, you may not store any information accessed through any Pinterest Materials including the API. Instead, call the API each time you need to access information.

* Only access someone's account with authorization, for example by using an access token. Do not solicit or collect login credentials or use login credentials to access other people’s accounts or take actions on their behalf.

* Only use information from someone’s account to provide services to that person.

* Don't combine someone's account information with information from other people's accounts or with information from other services.

* Don't share or sell information from our API with a third party, including another advertising service. (It's okay to share information with the person from whose account that information came.)

* Keep your API access credentials private. Do not use someone else’s API credentials, and do not allow anyone else to use yours.
    
    * End users may request API access credentials for use with a “bring-your-own-key” application, as long as the application stores the end user’s API credentials locally (not server-side) and the application complies with all other policies and guidelines. For example, the application must not solicit Pinterest user passwords, session cookies, etc.
    

* Don’t try to evade our policy enforcement systems. For example, if we remove your app, don’t try to reconnect the same or a substantially similar app using a different account or under a different name.

* Follow any instructions in our technical documentation.

* You must have a privacy policy that’s consistent with all applicable laws. You’ll need to include a link to your privacy policy when you apply for API access.

What to do
----------

Acceptable uses of the Pinterest Materials such as our developer tools and APIs include building integrations such as:

* Advertising tools, like apps for managing campaigns across multiple channels

* Audience tools, which help advertisers use advanced targeting features

* Content marketing tools, like Pin schedulers

* Creative tools, like apps for designing images or editing video

* Creator platforms, like those that facilitate collaboration between Creators and brands

* Dynamic creative tools, like apps that automate the creation of content

* Feed management tools, which help end users optimize their product listings

* Merchant platforms, like those that host ecommerce stores

* Measurement tools, which can help advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns

* Shoppable experience tools, like those that allow users to purchase items shown in your content

You can browse our [Partners site](https://business.pinterest.com/pinterest-partners/) to learn more about some of the existing integrations that developers have built on the Pinterest Platform. Our [Developers site](https://developers.pinterest.com/) contains documentation to help you get started as well as best practices for working with the Pinterest Platform.

What not to do
--------------

Unacceptable uses of the Pinterest Materials such as our developer tools and APIs include:

* Creating or providing an app for the purpose of violating Pinterest policies.

* Taking actions on behalf of end users without their specific knowledge and consent. This includes but is not limited to actions like: modifying Pinner profiles; creating, saving and editing Pins; following and unfollowing; sending messages; and making comments.

* Offering features that enable end users to automatically initiate actions without specifically considering each action.
    
    * For example, if your app allows end users to schedule Pin publishing, the end user must choose each Pin to be published. Similarly, if your app allows end users to follow accounts on Pinterest, the end user must choose each account to follow.
    
    * Put simply, end users are responsible for the actions that they take on Pinterest, and we want those actions to be genuine—so don't build automations that could lessen the authenticity of engagement on Pinterest or lead end users to perform an action that they didn't understand or intend.
    

* Attempting or claiming to provide platform insights, benchmarking, or competitor research features unless you have explicit written authorization from Pinterest. For example, don’t make statements about Pinterest’s overall performance related to a competitor or to industry benchmarks, and don’t do the same for brands or accounts.

* Using any automated means or form of scraping or data extraction to access information from Pinterest, except as expressly permitted by Pinterest.

* Misrepresenting your relationship with Pinterest or your level of access to the Pinterest Materials.

* Using information from Pinterest to target people with advertising outside of Pinterest, whether directly or bundled with third-party data. For example, do not bundle or sell content or data from Pinterest on other advertising networks, via data brokers, or through any other advertising or monetization service.

* Using your API access or developer tools to test Pinterest’s rate limits or other abuse prevention systems without specific authorization from Pinterest.

* Offering any feature to circumvent Pinterest restrictions. For example, don’t offer a feature that would allow end users in a region to access content that Pinterest has restricted from that region (a.k.a. geoblocked).

* Requiring or incentivizing engagement. For example, don’t require end users to create or save a Pin to a certain website, or to save a certain Pin in exchange for a benefit.

* Attempting to evade our consent mechanisms but gathering your own user consent for API-provided information.

* Apps intended for children under the age of 13 are not permitted.

Publishing content
------------------

If your app publishes content from Pinterest, you must:

* Link Pins back to their source on Pinterest (e.g. [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/424605071126047814/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/424605071126047814/)), and make sure it’s clear that the content comes from Pinterest.

* Not cover or obscure content from Pinterest. For example, don’t apply filters to Pins.

* Not create new content from Pins that can be distributed on your app or service.

Audience & advertiser services
------------------------------

If you provide audience onboarding, you must comply in particular with the user consent obligations and data restrictions in the [Ad Data Terms](https://policy.pinterest.com/ad-data-terms) and [Advertising Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines).

If advertisers will use data you’ve provided to them for online behavioral advertising, you also need to:

* Give clear and prominent notice to everyone you collect data from letting them know that their information will be shared with third parties for online behavioral advertising, and gather any necessary consents.

* Give instructions on how to opt out of the use of their information for online behavioral advertising, for example through the AdChoices website optout.aboutads.info.

* Not send Pinterest information about people who've opted out or not opted in.

* Regularly update data to remove people who've opted out.

If you use information from any Pinterest API to provide an advertising service, you must comply with our [Ad Data Terms](https://policy.pinterest.com/ad-data-terms) and [Advertising Guidelines](https://policy.pinterest.com/advertising-guidelines), and also do the following:

* If you report last-click attribution metrics, next to them with equal prominence you must show multi-touch metrics that divide attribution equally among each attributed service.

* Clearly and separately show the fees you charge for Pinterest advertising and the fees that Pinterest charges (both the absolute amount and by billing metrics, like CPM or CPC), and don't combine your fees with ours.

* Don't use information from our API except to serve and evaluate the performance of ads on Pinterest.

Regarding app abuse
-------------------

We want developer applications to help everyone find the inspiration to create a life they love. Apps created for abuse (for example, apps created to spread spam) are not permitted. In addition, we expect developers to be responsible partners in abuse prevention and to take steps to mitigate the risk of their app being used in harmful ways by end users. This includes, for example, not offering features that facilitate spamming Pinterest or other users. We may remove apps in order to protect Pinners at any time.
