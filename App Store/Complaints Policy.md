Claims of Infringement (DMCA / DSA)
===================================

**Procedure for Making Claims of Infringement**

Apple Inc. is registered with the United States Copyright Office as an online service provider (refer to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 USC 512, or the “DMCA”). 

Apple Distribution International Limited also provides iCloud in the European Union. iCloud storage is subject to the Digital Services Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/2065) (the “DSA”).

If you believe that a third party is using iCloud in a manner which infringes your intellectual property, please report the information by filling out the below copyright complaint web form. You will need to submit a report that includes the following (please consult your legal counsel or see Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA or Article 16 of the DSA to confirm these requirements). **You can only make a DMCA complaint if you are the copyright owner (or acting on behalf of the copyright owner).**

*   A physical or electronic signature of the owner of the copyright (or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright) or an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
*   Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
*   Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed (or access to which is to be disabled), and information reasonably sufficient to permit Apple to locate the material, such as the exact URL(s) where the allegedly infringing material is located.
*   Information reasonably sufficient to permit Apple to contact you, the complaining party, such as your (or your company’s) name and email address and an address and telephone number at which you may be contacted.
*   A statement that you, the complaining party, have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
*   A statement confirming your bona fide belief that the information in the notification of claimed infringement is accurate and complete and, under penalty of perjury, that you, the complaining party, are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Upon receipt of your complaint, we will send a confirmation of receipt to the email address provided. Once your complaint has been processed and reviewed, we will notify you by email of the action we have taken and any possibilities of redress.

For DMCA notifications of claimed infringement, you have the option to send a proper and complete notification of claimed infringement to our designated agent at the mailing address listed below. Please note that processing will take longer for regular mail than use of the online form.
