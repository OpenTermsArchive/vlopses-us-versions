App Store Badges
----------------

Include App Store badges in all digital and printed marketing materials as a clear call to action to get your app. App Store badges are available in 40 localizations to help you reach a broader audience. Versions are available for the App Store for iPhone and iPad, the Mac App Store, and Apple TV.

### Marketing Tools

Generate embeddable code that leads to your App Store product page and displays an App Store badge, your app icon, or a QR code. You can also download specific badges based on language and style.

#### Download (All Versions)

### Preferred Badges

Use the preferred black badge in all marketing communications promoting your app. The gray border surrounding the black badge is part of the badge artwork and should not be modified. Whenever one or more badges for other app platforms appear in the layout, use the preferred black badge. Place the App Store badge first in the lineup of badges.

### Alternative Badges

The alternative white badge is designed to give you greater versatility and can be used when the preferred black badge appears visually heavy in the layout. The alternative badge is suitable when only one badge appears in the layout and when it complements the colors used in the layout. If badges for other app platforms appear in your communication, use the preferred black badge, not the alternative white badge.

### Localized Badges

Apple provides badge artwork with the modifiers _Download on the_ and _Pre-order on the_ translated into regional languages. The service mark _App Store_ always appears in English. Never translate _App Store_ or create your own localized badge.

Available in Azərbaycan dili, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Melayu, Catalan, Čeština, Dansk, Deutsch, Eesti Keel, English, Español, Français, Hrvatski, Italiano, Latviski, Lietuviškai, Magyar, Malti, Nederlands, Norsk, Polski, Português, Português Brasil, Pусский, Română, Slovenčina, Slovenščina, Suomi, Svenska, Tagalog, Tiếng Việt, Türkçe, Ελληνικά, Україна, हिंदी, български, עברית, العربية , ภาษาไทย, 한국어, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文.

### Badge Use

Use one App Store badge per layout or video. Place the badge in a subordinate position to the image or main message so that it isn’t the dominant artwork. Don’t modify, angle, or animate the App Store badge.

Use the pre-order badge to indicate that your app is available for pre-order on the App Store. Once the app is released for download, be sure to replace the pre-order badge with the download badge in all of your marketing materials. For more information on making your apps available for pre-order, see [Offering Your Apps for Pre-Order](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/pre-orders/).

Use only the badge artwork provided in these guidelines. Don’t use icons, logos, graphics, or images from www.apple.com to promote your app. Never use the Apple logo in place of the word _Apple_. Don’t use the standalone Apple logo.

#### Link to Your App

Generate short links or embeddable code that lead to your App Store product page and display your app icon, a QR code, or an App Store badge.

### Graphic Standards

Minimum clear space is equal to one-quarter the height of the badge. Don’t place photos, typography, or other graphic elements inside the minimum clear space.

Minimum badge height is 10 mm for use in printed materials and 40 px for use onscreen. Select a size that is clearly legible but not dominant in the layout.

When the badge is placed on advertising with very limited layout space, such as banners for mobile devices, select a badge size that is clearly legible on the target mobile devices. Minimum clear space for very limited layout space is equal to one-tenth the height of the badge.

For printed materials, the badge can be printed in one color if black and white inks are not used on the layout. The line art portion of the badge (Apple logo, type, and outline rule) can be printed in the ink color used on the layout as long as it provides sufficient contrast for clear legibility.

Apple Product Images
--------------------

Use Apple-provided product bezels in all your marketing materials to display your app on the Apple devices it supports. Always use the latest-generation devices for which your app is currently developed.

[Download Apple Product Bezels](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#product-bezels)

### Image Use

Feature Apple product images on their own in your communications, and don’t include images of competing products. References to multiple platforms and competing products can be made only in copy or with badges.

Use Apple product images “as is” and without modification. Modifications include adding reflections, shadows, highlights, or graphic elements that appear to enter or come out of the product screen; cropping, tilting, or obstructing any part of the images; animating, flipping, or spinning the images; or creating buttons or icons with a product image. You can place promotional copy or violators beside the product images, not on top of them.

### Graphic Standards

Use Apple product images at a size that is clearly legible at the image resolution provided. Ensure that the minimum device size is no smaller than 25 mm in height for printed materials and 200 px onscreen. Maintain the correct relative product scale whenever multiple products are shown.

#### Unauthorized Uses

The following uses of Apple products are not permitted in marketing materials:

*   Rendering in 3D or creating any simulation of an Apple product
*   Illustrations that depict an Apple product, except for instructional material
*   Die-cut promotions in the shape of an Apple product
*   Food industry disposable packaging or promotions that use an Apple product or App Store badge
*   Decals, bumper stickers, or magnets placed on the outside of any vehicle that use an Apple product or App Store badge
*   Graphics, illustrations, or logotypes to represent an Apple product

If your marketing contains illustrations of generic devices, ensure that these devices do not include details that are unique to Apple products, such as the iPhone Home button, sensor housing, Ring/Silent switch, or volume controls.

### Screen Content

Focus on the experience of using your app and not on Apple product functions. Display your app on the screen as it appears when your app is running. For apps that work within Messages, Siri, Phone, or Maps, display your app within the Apple UI exactly as it appears when your app is running. Apps that support widgets may display this functionality in screen content as long as no third-party content is shown on the Home Screen. Be sure to create screens using the latest operating system version. Don’t display a blank screen on an Apple product, or on a television screen when showcasing Apple TV.

You are responsible for securing the rights to all materials used in screen content within your app, and you should display fictional account information instead of data from a real person. For the screen content of apps that work within Apple apps, you are responsible for securing the rights and approvals for third-party content such as store names or locations.

#### Status Bar

The status bar for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch should show a full network icon or product designator, a full Wi-Fi icon, and a full battery icon. If your app runs full screen, you can extend your app screen image over the status bar. If your app is optimized for 5G networks, you can display the 5G icon in the status bar from a compatible device.

Status bar options are provided on different layers within the Smart Object layer. Be sure to select the correct localized layer for the region in which your marketing communications will appear.

#### Push Notifications

When showing push notifications from your app in advertising, display a single push notification on the lock screen of the Apple device. Don’t include multiple push notifications from your app, or other app’s push notifications. If tapped, the push notification must open the app directly. Don’t show the Home Screen of the Apple device.

#### Home Screen

If your app supports widgets, you may show your app’s widget on the Home Screen as long as no third-party content is depicted in your communications. Otherwise, don’t display an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, or Apple TV Home Screen.

For product images of iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air in the desktop display option, remember to add your icon to the Dock and customize the menu bar titles to match your app’s menu bar.

Custom Photography and Video
----------------------------

Custom photography and video of Apple products are allowed. Show people interacting with the Apple product in an authentic way, and feature your app in a realistic manner, exactly as a user will experience it.

### Product Use

Straight-on product shots are preferred. Don’t use extreme angles or alter an Apple product in any way. The product’s color, shape, size, and form must be accurate. Don’t engage in “suspension of disbelief” by showing Apple products or your app in a fantastic or unrealistic manner.

Only show the back of a device in an authentic manner to illustrate natural use of the device. Don’t feature the Apple logo to take advantage of the promotional value of the Apple brand. Don’t obscure or cover the logo.

In video, once you show an establishing shot of the entire Apple device, you may pan and zoom to focus on your app. Present the movement in a simple, clear manner. Use straightforward transitions such as fade or dissolve. Don’t use Apple user interaction gestures such as Multi-Touch or trackpad swipes to perform scene transitions.

Start the app sequence with your app open. If app sequences are shortened, display a “sequences shortened” disclaimer. You can use the sounds that your app makes naturally as audio elements of your video, but don’t use the native sounds of the Apple device.

Focus on the experience of using your app running on the latest operating system. Don’t display a blank screen on an Apple product, or on a television screen when showcasing Apple TV. For more details, see [Screen Content](#screen-content).

#### Approved Devices

Use only the devices and colors provided. If multiple Apple products are shown, display them in the correct relative sizes. Always display the product “as is” — don’t add cases or covers. Don’t show an Apple product along with a competing product from another manufacturer. For Apple TV communications, avoid showing the television manufacturer’s name.

#### Trademark Attribution

Include Apple credit lines wherever legal information is provided. At the end of a video, display the correct credit lines for Apple trademarks used in your video as described in Legal Requirements below. Maintain clear-space requirements when credit lines follow the badge.

Messaging and Writing Style
---------------------------

When promoting your app, your headline and copy should focus on your app, not on Apple product features. Use clear, simple messaging. Always include a call to action to download your app.

Refer to the correct product names your app supports, and avoid referring to iOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS in your marketing communications. Don’t refer to Apple devices generically as “smartphones” or “tablets.” Use the product names.

### Product Names

Use Apple product names such as Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple TV in a referential phrase to indicate that your app is compatible with these products. For example, say _app name for iPhone_ or _app name for iPad_, or use a phrase such as _works with_ or _compatible with_. Don’t say _iPhone app name_.

List all the Apple products that your app runs on. Don’t list Apple products that are not compatible with your app.

When including your company name, lead with the company name followed by the app name and end with the appropriate Apple product names. For example, it is correct to say _Company name App name for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch_.

#### Spelling and Language

Always use the correct Apple product names with the correct capitalization as shown on the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html). Always use Apple product names in singular form. Modifiers such as _model_, _device_, or _collection_ can be plural or possessive. Never typeset Apple product names using all uppercase letters.

#### iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch

Always typeset _iPhone_, _iPad_, or _iPod touch_ with a lowercase _i_ and an uppercase _P_ followed by lowercase letters. Always typeset _touch_ with a lowercase _t_. The name _iPhone_, _iPad_, or _iPod touch_ should start with a lowercase _i_ even when it is the first word in a sentence, paragraph, or title. Don’t use variations such as _touch_ or _iTouch_. Never use a lowercase _i_ followed by all uppercase letters.

##### iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR

For headlines and copy, use an uppercase _X_, small cap _S_, and small cap _R_ whenever technically possible and when you can ensure efficient and accurate implementation. For example: iPhone XS Max. When you cannot ensure that small caps will render accurately or when technical limitations may prevent the display of small caps, use an uppercase _X, S,_ and _R_. For example: iPhone XS Max.

To implement small caps on webpages, make sure your specified font supports OpenType and use the font-variant CSS property font-variant: small-caps;.

#### MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac

_Mac_ is always set with an uppercase _M_ followed by lowercase letters; _MacBook_ is one word with an uppercase _M_ and _B_; and _iMac_ always begins with a lowercase _i_ followed by an uppercase _M_ followed by lowercase letters. _iMac_ begins with a lowercase _i_ even when it is the first word in a sentence.

#### Apple Vision Pro

Always typeset _Apple Vision Pro_ as three words with an uppercase _A_, _V_, and _P_ followed by lowercase letters. Don’t break _Apple Vision Pro_ over two lines. Don’t use the article _the_ before _Apple Vision Pro_. Apple Vision Pro _apps are available on the App Store_ or can be _downloaded from the App Store_. It’s acceptable to say _Name of app for Apple Vision Pro_ when your promotion is focused on features and benefits related to Apple Vision Pro. Don’t refer to Apple Vision Pro generically as a “headset.” The phrase “Apple Vision Pro” can’t be included in your app name, but it can be included in your app description.

**Spatial computing.** Refer to your app as a spatial computing app. Don’t describe your app experience as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR).

#### Apple Watch

Always typeset Apple Watch as two words with an uppercase _A_ and an uppercase _W_ followed by lowercase letters. Don’t break _Apple Watch_ over two lines. Don’t use the article _the_ before _Apple Watch_. Apple Watch apps are _available on the App Store_ or can be _downloaded on the App Store_. It is acceptable to say _Name of app for Apple Watch_ when your promotion is focused on your app features and benefits related to Apple Watch.

When promoting your app, your headlines and copy should focus on your app, not on Apple Watch features. Don’t use the word _watch_ or _time_ as a pun or verb in your marketing materials.

When referring to Apple Watch, include the series number, such as _Apple Watch Series 6_, depending on the features and functionality available in your app.

#### Apple TV

_Apple TV_ is typeset as two words with an uppercase _A_ followed by lowercase letters, and an uppercase _TV_. If your app is offered only for Apple TV, clarify that your app is exclusive to Apple TV and available only from the App Store on Apple TV.

#### App Store

Always typeset _App Store_ with an uppercase _A_ and an uppercase _S_ followed by lowercase letters.

Refer to just the _App Store_ unless you need to be more specific; in that case, you can use _App Store for iPhone_, _App Store for iPad_, _Mac App Store_, _App Store for Apple TV,_ _App Store for Apple Watch_, or _App Store for iMessage_. To refer to all the versions, use this order: _App Store for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and iMessage_. Don’t use terms such as _Apple Watch App Store_ or _App Store for watchOS_.

Include only the article _the_ before App Store and Mac App Store. Never include other descriptors; for example, don’t say _iTunes App Store_, _Apple App Store_, or _iPhone App Store_. Don’t add superlatives such as _the best App Store._ It is correct to say that an app is _available on the App Store_ or _can be downloaded from the App Store_. Don’t use _at the App Store_. Don’t use the term _downloadable_.

#### Apple Apps and Services

When using the Apple names _Apple Pay_, _Wallet_, _Messages_, _Siri_, _Phone_, or _Maps_, always typeset with a capital letter. iMessage, the service within the Messages app, must be spelled with a lowercase _i_ and an uppercase _M_ followed by lowercase letters.

[View Apple Pay guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/marketing/)  
[View Apple Wallet guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/wallet/)

#### Other Platforms

Apple product names can appear in copy along with the names of other app platforms or devices. List Apple products first. Although the names of other products can be used in promotional copy, never display Apple product images alongside the images of other products.

#### URL Address Naming

Apple trademark names can be included in your URL address only when the trademark follows your company and/or product name. Apple trademarks can be used in URLs only for web pages that feature apps developed specifically for the Apple product named. Never start a URL with an Apple trademark.

Acceptable: _www.company.com/app/iphone_ or _www.company.com/ipad_  
Not acceptable: _www.iphoneapp.com_ or _www.ipadweatherapp.com_

#### Do Not Translate

Always set Apple trademarks in English, even when they appear within text in a language other than English. Terms that should not be translated or transliterated include:

*   App Store
*   Apple Pay
*   Apple Pencil
*   Apple TV
*   Apple Vision Pro
*   Apple Watch
*   iMac
*   iPad
*   iPhone
*   iPod touch
*   MacBook Air
*   MacBook Pro
*   Siri

Legal Requirements
------------------

### Trademark Symbols

In communications distributed only in the United States, the appropriate symbol (™, ℠, or ®) must follow each Apple trademark the first time it is mentioned in body copy. Do not use trademark symbols on products, product documentation, or other product communications that will be distributed outside the United States.

For example, use _Apple Watch®, iPhone®, iPad®, iPod touch®, Apple TV®, App Store®, Mac App Store℠, Mac®, MacBook Pro®, MacBook Air®_, and _iMac®_.

Don’t add symbols to headline copy or to the App Store badge artwork provided by Apple.

For the correct trademark symbols, refer to the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html).

### Credit Lines

Use the appropriate credit lines in all communications worldwide, listing all the Apple trademarks and products included in your communication and advertising. Include the credit lines only once in your communication or website, and place the credit lines wherever you provide legal notification. Follow standard practices for the placement of legal copy, such as creating additional screens or providing interactive links. When the App Store badge is used, credit both Apple and the Apple Logo.

Refer to the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html) for the correct trademark symbol, spelling of the trademark, and generic term to use with the trademark. Generally, the symbol appears at the right shoulder of the trademark (except the Apple Logo, where the logo appears at the right foot).

Use the following formats for distribution within the United States only:

\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_ are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_ are trademarks of Apple Inc.

For distribution outside the United States, use one of the following international credit notices:

\_\_\_\_\_\_ and\_\_\_\_\_\_ are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

\_\_\_\_\_\_ and\_\_\_\_\_\_ are trademarks of Apple Inc.

A translation of the legal notice and credit lines (but not the trademarks) can be used in materials distributed outside the U.S.

For more information on using Apple trademarks, see [Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html).

### Association with Apple

Your app screen images, Mac, Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV product images, or photographs thereof cannot be used in any manner that falsely suggests an association with Apple or is likely to reduce, diminish, or damage the goodwill, value, or reputation associated with the App Store, the Mac App Store, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Apple itself.

Guidelines for Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights
====================================================

(Formerly entitled Guidelines for Third Parties Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights)

These guidelines are for Apple licensees, authorized resellers, developers, customers, and other parties wishing to use Apple’s trademarks, service marks or images in promotional, advertising, instructional, or reference materials, or on their web sites, products, labels, or packaging. Use of the keyboard Apple Logo (Option-Shift-K) for commercial purposes without the prior written consent of Apple may constitute trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of federal and state laws. Use of Apple trademarks may be prohibited, unless expressly authorized.

If you are a licensee of an Apple trademark or logo and have been provided with special trademark usage guidelines with your license agreement, please follow those guidelines. If your license agreement does not provide usage guidelines, then follow these guidelines. If you are an Apple Authorized Reseller or member of an Apple program, you may be subject to additional restrictions.

Apple’s trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are valuable assets. In following these guidelines, you help us protect our valuable trademark rights and strengthen our corporate and brand identities. By using an Apple trademark, in whole or in part, you are acknowledging that Apple is the sole owner of the trademark and promising that you will not interfere with Apple’s rights in the trademark, including challenging Apple’s use, registration of, or application to register such trademark, alone or in combination with other words, anywhere in the world, and that you will not harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute any Apple trademark. The goodwill derived from using any part of an Apple trademark exclusively inures to the benefit of and belongs to Apple. Except for the limited right to use as expressly permitted under these Guidelines, no other rights of any kind are granted hereunder, by implication or otherwise. If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, please talk to your Apple representative or submit your query to [Apple’s Trademark Department](https://www.apple.com/legal/contact/).

a. Your product is not a computer, computer system, or operating system software.

b. Your product is Mac compatible or the third party business is associated with Mac based computers.

h. If you are an Apple Authorized Reseller or member of an Apple program, you may be subject to additional restrictions.

**Rules for Proper Use of Apple Trademarks**

**1.** Trademarks are adjectives used to modify nouns; the noun is the generic name of a product or service.

**2.** As adjectives, trademarks may not be used in the plural or possessive form.

Correct: I bought two Macintosh computers.

Not Correct: I bought two Macintoshes.

**3.** An appropriate generic term must appear after the trademark the first time it appears in a printed piece, and as often as is reasonable after that. For a list of suggested generic terms see the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html).

**4.** Always spell and capitalize Apple’s trademarks exactly as they are shown in the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html). Do not shorten or abbreviate Apple product names. Do not make up names that contain Apple trademarks.

**Proper Trademark Notice and Attribution**

**1\. Distribution Within the United States Only**

a. On product, product documentation, or other product communications that will be distributed only in the United States, use the appropriate trademark symbol (TM, SM, ®) the first time the Apple trademark appears in the text of the advertisement, brochure, or other material.

b. Refer to the [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html) for the correct trademark symbol, spelling of the trademark, and generic term to use with the trademark. Generally, the symbol appears at the right shoulder of the trademark (except the Apple Logo, where the logo appears at the right foot).

c. Include an attribution of Apple’s ownership of its trademarks within the credit notice section of your product, product documentation, or other product communication.

Following are the correct formats:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are trademarks of Apple Inc.

**2\. Distribution Outside the United States:**

a. Do not use trademark symbols on products, product documentation, or other product communications that will be distributed outside the United States.

b. Use one of the following international credit notices:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a trademark of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries and regions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a trademark of Apple Inc.

**Depictions of Apple Products**

**1\. Endorsement or Sponsorship:** Apple does not support the use of its logos, company names, product names, or images of Apple products by other parties in marketing, promotional or advertising materials as their use may create the perception that Apple endorses or sponsors the product, service or promotion.

**2\. Compatibility:** If you are a developer, you may show an image of an Apple product in your promotional/advertising materials to depict that your product is compatible with, or otherwise works with, the Apple product or technology, provided you comply with the following requirements:

a. Your product is in fact compatible with, or otherwise works with, the referenced Apple product.

b. The image is an actual photograph of the genuine Apple product and not an artist’s rendering (Note: You must obtain express written permission from Apple before using any photograph owned or licensed by Apple).

c. The Apple product is shown only in the best light, in a manner or context that reflects favorably on the Apple products and on Apple Inc.

d. The reference to Apple does not create a sense of endorsement or sponsorship by, or other false association with, Apple or Apple products.

Apple Trademark List\*
======================

A trademark can be a word, phrase, symbol, or design that distinguishes the source of the goods or services. Also, as trade dress, it can be the appearance of a product or its packaging, including size, shape, color, texture, graphics, and appearance (e.g, retail store or website).

The following is a non-exhaustive list of Apple’s trademarks and service marks.

When using the marks in publications that will be distributed only in the United States, include the appropriate ™, ℠, or ® symbol on first use. For publications that will be distributed outside the United States, do not include trademark symbols. Instead use the appropriate trademark attribution notice, for example: Mac and macOS are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries and regions.

The list also includes a suggested generic term for each trademark. For all publications, include an appropriate generic term after the trademark the first time it appears. Thereafter, the generic term should appear frequently with the trademark. (These generic terms are only suggestions, and there may be other words that are equally appropriate.)

Trademarks are adjectives, and should not be made into verbs or made plural or possessive. For more information on how to use Apple’s trademarks, refer to the document titled, “[Guidelines for Using Apple Trademarks](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html),” or contact the [Trademark team](https://www.apple.com/legal/contact/#apple-trademark).

The absence of a product or service name or logo from this list does not constitute a waiver of Apple’s trademark or other intellectual property rights concerning that name or logo.
