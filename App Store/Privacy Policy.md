Apple Store App & Privacy
-------------------------

Your devices, searches, services, browsing, purchases, Apple Store shopping activity, and device trust score may be used to personalize your experience, send you notifications, provide and improve the store, and prevent fraud.  
   

Apple Store app is designed to connect you with Apple products and services that you may be interested in while protecting your privacy.  
  
  

  

*   We collect your personal data so that we can provide you the content, services, and features in the Apple Store app.
*   We use information about your purchases, connected devices, subscriptions, and other activity in the Apple Store app to tailor features and offer personalized recommendations for you.
*   We use information about your devices and other account information to provide relevant offers for you.
*   Subject to your consent, we use information about your browsing, purchases, searches, and other activity in the Apple Store app to improve the app and to improve and evaluate our services.
*   To help identify and prevent fraud, information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive, will be used to compute a device trust score when you attempt a purchase. The submissions are designed so Apple cannot learn the real values on your device. The scores are stored for a fixed time on our servers.

Privacy is a core principle at Apple and a priority in all that we do. We believe that it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it so that you can make informed choices.

Apple uses your personal data to provide the services and features in the Apple Store app. This includes account and payment information, which you can access and update on the Apple Store app account page.

Apple collects information that you provide when you shop or search for products or services, such as billing and shipping information, or the information you provide when you register for a Today at Apple session using the Apple Store app. Apple uses this information to personalize your experience on the Apple Store app, provide you with the product or service that you requested, for fraud and security, to improve your experience with your consent, and to comply with applicable laws. In certain circumstances, such as to provide you with gifts purchased for you on the Apple Store app, Apple may collect information about you, such as your contact information, from the third party purchasing our products or services on your behalf.

Improving and Personalizing the Apple Store App

Apple collects information about how you use the Apple Store app, your past purchases, your connected devices, and your Apple services and subscriptions to tailor your Apple Store app experience to help you discover content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we may use information about recent purchases to recommend products, subscriptions, payment options, or Today at Apple sessions that may interest you. This also allows us to recommend products that match your devices, or that are based on similar purchases made by customers who own devices like yours. To opt out of receiving these personalized recommendations within the Apple Store app, or to customize the personal information you share with the Apple Store app, go to Account > Settings in the Apple Store app. If you allow the Apple Store app to access your precise location, it may be used to provide you with relevant information such as nearby Apple store locations or Today at Apple sessions. To change whether you share your precise location with the Apple Store app, go to Settings > Apple Store and tap Location.

Apple uses models to provide many of the features of the Apple Store app. These models are used to improve your experience in the app, such as by ensuring the content that is displayed to you will be relevant to your interests and to provide you with an efficient shopping experience. In addition, models are used to improve the search relevance in the Apple Store app and, in some jurisdictions, to power our chat functionality. Subject to your Apple Store app settings, data associated with your Apple Account may be aggregated and used to improve these models. In relevant jurisdictions, to customize the personal information you share with the Apple Store app and how it is used, go to Account > Settings in the Apple Store app.

Siri also suggests Today at Apple sessions based on on-device information derived from the apps you use and the websites you visit with Safari. To change how Siri accesses your information, go to Settings > Siri & Search.

Your sign-in information is shared across the Apple Store app, iTunes Store, and the App Store. If you are signed in, information about your devices and the subscriptions associated with your Apple Account will be available to you in the Apple Store app and will be used to personalize your Apple Store app experience. You can control whether information about your devices and services are used to personalize your experience by going to Account > Settings and then tapping “Your Devices” or “Your Services” within the Apple Store app. To sign out, go to Settings > \[your name\] > Media & Purchases, then tap Sign Out.

The Apple Store app may use information about how you have chosen to pay for your devices in the past, such as whether you are a participant in a financing program, have Apple Pay or Apple Wallet enabled, or have saved a credit card to your Apple Account, to tailor your payment options.

Apple collects information about how you use the Apple Store app, interact with content on the app, and your past purchases to improve the Apple Store app for you and others and to improve and evaluate Apple’s services. To opt out of providing this information to Apple, within the Apple Store app, go to Account > Settings and tap Analytics.

Communicating with You

Email Notifications  
Apple may use your Apple Account information to send you communications about the Apple Store and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you and request your feedback on your in-store experience or products and services you have purchased. For example, Apple may use information about your devices such as device serial number to check eligibility for certain trade-in offers. Apple may also use information about your activity within the Apple Store app and the Apple Store to send you emails and notifications about your transactions, new devices, features, sessions, special store events, and personalized recommendations in the Apple Store and Apple Store app if you choose to receive email and/or notifications.

Push Notifications  
Apple may use information about your Apple Account, such as the Apple products you own, your billing zip code, and certain Apple Account information to send you relevant offers and promotions available in the Apple Store and Apple Store app if you choose to receive email, opt in for alerts about new products, and/or Announcements and Offers notifications.

Changing Your Email and Push Notification Settings

You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to [account.apple.com](http://account.apple.com/) > Privacy > Messages from Apple and tapping Announcements. To update your notification preferences, go to Settings > Apple Store > Notifications. You can also update your notification preferences within the Apple Store app by going to Account > Settings > Notification Settings.

In-Store Experiences

Some of Apple’s in-store experiences, like Connect & Personalize, will use the Apple Store app. The use of your personal information for these experiences will be subject to a separate privacy notice.

Sharing with Third Parties

Apple may share your information with partners for purposes of fulfilling your request, such as processing your purchase, product delivery, or customer service. Apple may also provide information which cannot be linked to you to third party partners that provide our products and services or that help Apple market to customers. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.

Information about products not manufactured by Apple, or independent websites not controlled or tested by Apple, is provided without recommendation or endorsement. Apple assumes no responsibility with regard to the selection, performance, or use of third-party websites or products. Apple makes no representations regarding third-party website accuracy or reliability. Risks are inherent in the use of the internet. Contact the vendor for additional information. Other company and product names may be trademarks of their respective owners.

Non-Personal Data

We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal data for any purpose. For example, we may aggregate your non-personal data with that of other Apple Store app users for purposes of evaluating or improving the service.

Retention

We retain personal data associated with your transactions and activities at Apple Stores only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in Apple’s Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law. Some information, such as purchase history but not your stored card details, may be retained as business records even after you close your account or delete the Apple Store app.

Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity

We also collect personal data to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Apple Store app and other Apple online stores, and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, precise location information (approximated by matching the IP address of your internet connection to a geographic region, if available), download and purchase history, and other interactions with the stores. When you initiate a purchase, Apple may use information about your historical business relationship with Apple to process the request and determine whether to provide the product or service in advance of authorization by the “payment partner.”

We also compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt a purchase using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at [www.apple.com/privacy](http://www.apple.com/privacy)
