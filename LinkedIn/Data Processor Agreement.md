LinkedIn shall provide reasonable reimbursement to Customer for any costs associated with notifying affected individuals as required by law or providing individuals with credit monitoring or other appropriate remediation services, provided that LinkedIn, as a processor, will adhere to its commitments under 5.3(b) of this DPA.

#### **6\. AUDIT, CERTIFICATION**

**6.1 Supervisory Authority Audit of Customer.** If a Supervisory Authority requires an audit of the data processing facilities from which LinkedIn Processes Customer Personal Data in order to ascertain or monitor Customer's compliance with Data Protection Requirements, LinkedIn will cooperate with such audit. Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to such audit, including all reasonable costs and fees for any and all time LinkedIn expends for any such audit, in addition to the rates for services performed by LinkedIn.

**6.2 Audits.** Upon request, LinkedIn will provide to Customer each year an opinion or Service Organization Control report provided by an accredited, third-party audit firm under the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 (“**SSAE 18**”) (Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization) or the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402 (“**ISAE 3402**”) (Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization) standards applicable to the services under the Agreement (each such report, a “**Report**”). If a Report does not provide, in Customer’s reasonable judgment, sufficient information to confirm LinkedIn’s compliance with the terms of this DPA, then Customer or an accredited third-party audit firm agreed to by both Customer and LinkedIn may audit LinkedIn’s compliance with the terms of this DPA during regular business hours, with reasonable advance notice to LinkedIn and subject to reasonable confidentiality procedures. Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to such audit, including all reasonable costs and fees for any and all time LinkedIn expends for any such audit, in addition to the rates for services performed by LinkedIn. Before the commencement of any such audit, Customer and LinkedIn shall mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit. Customer shall promptly notify LinkedIn with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit. Customer may not audit LinkedIn more than once annually.

#### **7\. DATA TRANSFERS**

**7.1** For transfers of EU Personal Data to LinkedIn for processing by LinkedIn in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 2 of the SCCs for Controller to Processor transfers, which are incorporated herein by reference. The parties agree that the following terms apply: (i) the Data Protection Commission of Ireland shall be the competent Supervisory Authority pursuant to Clause 13 of the SCCs; (ii) data subjects for whom a LinkedIn entity processes EU Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the applicable SCCs; (iii) the SCCs shall be governed by the law of Ireland, which allows for third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to Clause 17 of the SCCs; and (iv) any dispute arising from the SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland pursuant to Clause 18 of the SCCs. Schedule A to this DPA shall apply as Annex I of SCCs and Schedule D shall apply at Annex II of the SCCs.

**7.2** If LinkedIn is unable or becomes unable to comply with these requirements, then EU Personal Data will be processed and used exclusively within the territory of a member state of the European Union and any movement of EU Personal Data to a non-EU country requires the prior written consent of Customer. LinkedIn shall promptly notify Customer of any inability by LinkedIn to comply with the provisions of this Section 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the transfers contemplated under this Section 7 result in transfers of UK Personal Data to LinkedIn for processing by LinkedIn in a jurisdiction other than in the UK or UK Information Commissioner’s Office-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, (1) each party agrees it will use the 2010 Controller-to-Processor SCCs for so long as such SCCs are lawfully permitted for such transfers of UK Personal Data, and (2) Schedules A and D shall apply as Annex I and Annex II, respectively. In the event that the UK Information Commissioner’s Office confirms that a “UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses” (“**UK Addendum**”) is required to rely lawfully on the SCCs for transfers of UK Personal Data, then (a) the SCCs used for EU Personal Data shall also apply to transfers of UK Personal Data; (b) the UK Addendum shall be deemed executed between Customer and LinkedIn; and (c) the SCCs between the parties shall be deemed amended as specified in the UK Addendum in respect of the transfer of such UK Personal Data. The UK Information Commissioner is the exclusive Supervisory Authority for the transfers of UK Personal Data under this Agreement.

#### **8\. DATA RETURN AND DELETION**

The parties agree that on the termination of the data processing services or upon Customer’s reasonable request, LinkedIn shall, and shall cause any Subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, return all the Customer Personal Data and copies of such data to Customer or securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures, unless Data Protection Requirements prevent LinkedIn from returning or destroying all or part of the Customer Personal Data disclosed. In such case, LinkedIn agrees to preserve the confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data retained by it and that it will only actively Process such Customer Personal Data after such date in order to comply with applicable laws. For clarity, LinkedIn may continue to Process Customer Personal Data that has been aggregated in a manner that does not identify individuals or customers to improve LinkedIn’s systems and services.  

#### **9\. CONTROLLER-TO-CONTROLLER SCENARIOS**

Certain Services may offer integrated viewing and export of Personal Data of LinkedIn members that Customer already may access on LinkedIn’s website, LinkedIn.com, consistent with member privacy settings. For purposes of GDPR, where there is a member-directed export of Personal Data or where Customer already may access such Personal Data, both Customer and LinkedIn will be independent controllers of Personal Data originally derived on the LinkedIn Services. The parties agree that, for such cases, LinkedIn and Customer would each act as a data controller with respect to their particular copy of the Personal Data. Each party will, to the extent that it, along with the other party, acts as data controller, as the term is defined in applicable Data Protection Requirements, with respect to Personal Data, reasonably cooperate with the other party to enable the exercise of data protection rights as set forth in the Data Protection Requirements. Where both parties each act as data controller with respect to Personal Data, and the transfer of data between the parties results in a transfer of EU Personal Data to a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, each party agrees it will use Module 1 of the SCCs, which are incorporated herein by reference. The parties agree that the following terms apply: (i) the Data Protection Commission of Ireland shall be the competent Supervisory Authority pursuant to Clause 13 of the SCCs; (ii) data subjects for whom a LinkedIn entity processes EU Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the applicable SCCs; (iii) the SCCs shall be governed by the law of Ireland, which allows for third-party beneficiary rights pursuant to Clause 17 of the SCCs; and (iv) any dispute arising from the SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland pursuant to Clause 18 of the SCCs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the transfers contemplated under this Section 9 results in a transfer of UK Personal Data to a jurisdiction other than in the UK or UK Information Commissioner’s Office-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, (1) the 2004 Controller-to-Controller SCCs, which are incorporated herein by reference, will apply for so long as such SCCs are lawfully permitted for such transfers of UK Personal Data, (2) Schedule A and Schedule D shall apply as Annex B and Annex II, respectively, and (3) for purpose of Section II(h), the data importer will process the UK Personal Data, at its option, in accordance with the data processing principles set out in Annex A of the Controller-to-Controller SCCs. In the event that the UK Information Commissioner’s Office confirms that a UK Addendum is required to rely lawfully on the SCCs contemplated under this Section 9 for transfers of UK Personal Data, then (a) SCCs used for EU Personal Data under this Section 9 shall also apply to transfers of UK Personal Data; (b) the UK Addendum shall be deemed executed between Customer and LinkedIn; and (c) the SCCs between the parties shall be deemed amended as specified in the UK Addendum in respect of the transfer of such UK Personal Data..

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the parties acknowledge and agree that each is acting independently as Data Controller with respect of Personal Data and the parties are not joint controllers as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation and UK GDPR.

#### **10\. THIRD PARTY DATA PROCESSORS**

Customer acknowledges that in the provision of some services (such as Applicant Tracking Systems, Learning Management Systems, and Customer Management Systems), LinkedIn, on receipt of instructions from Customer, may transfer Customer Personal Data to and otherwise interact with third party data processors. Customer agrees that if and to the extent such transfers occur, Customer is responsible for entering into separate contractual arrangements with such third-party data processors binding them to comply with obligations in accordance with Data Protection Requirements. For avoidance of doubt, such third-party data processors are not Subprocessors.

#### **11\. TERM**

This DPA shall remain in effect as long as LinkedIn carries out Personal Data processing operations on behalf of Customer or until the termination of the LinkedIn Contract (and all Personal Data has been returned or deleted in accordance with Section 8 above).

#### **12\. GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE**

Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, this DPA shall be governed by the laws of Ireland, and any action or proceeding related to this DPA (including those arising from non-contractual disputes or claims) will be brought in Dublin, Ireland. However, where a dispute arises regarding the processing of UK Personal Data under this DPA, such dispute shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.

> SCHEDULE B

> ADDENDUM TO LINKEDIN DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT

> California Consumer Privacy Act

This Addendum is entered into by the LinkedIn customer identified on the applicable LinkedIn ordering document for LinkedIn services (“Customer”) and the LinkedIn company identified on the ordering document (“LinkedIn”), and amends the LinkedIn Data Processing Agreement between Customer and LinkedIn (“DPA”) with respect to LinkedIn’s processing of Customer Personal Data of California Consumers under the CCPA. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Addendum will have the meanings given to them in the DPA. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the DPA, will have the meanings given to them under the CCPA.

No CCPA Sale. The parties agree that for the purposes of the CCPA, LinkedIn acts as a CCPA Service Provider for Customer Personal Data. By executing the ordering document,

*   LinkedIn certifies that it has read and understands this Addendum and will abide by it, including by avoiding any action that would cause the other Party to be deemed to have Sold Personal Data or Personal Information under the CCPA.

> SCHEDULE C

> GLINT-SPECIFIC TERMS AND AMENDMENTS

The following terms and conditions amend the DPA with respect to only those LinkedIn products and services offered under the Glint brand (including Glint Engage and Glint Perform). For avoidance of doubt, if Customer purchases Glint services as provided under the Agreement (“Glint Services”) in addition to LinkedIn-branded services, the following amendments apply only with respect to those Glint products or services and the DPA will apply unamended with respect to the LinkedIn-branded services.

**_The following clauses are added to the DPA as a new Section 4.3:_**

   _4.3 Notice and Choice._ 

   _a. Customer agrees to provide appropriate notices to its Customer Users of the Glint Services about and, if required by Data Protection Requirements, obtain appropriate consent or other appropriate legal basis from such Customer Users for: (i) the collection, transfer and processing of Customer Personal Data through LinkedIn’s services and (ii) Customer’s use of any service providers or other third-parties that Customer instructs LinkedIn to send Customer Personal Data to or provide Customer Personal Data to LinkedIn. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer may provide LinkedIn with Personal Data for the purpose of enabling LinkedIn to provide the LinkedIn services. Customer represents and warrants that it has the necessary right and full power and authority to provide the Personal Data to LinkedIn._ 

   _b. Customer will decide the content of “User Confidentiality Notices” that will be provided to Customer Users (e.g., for Glint Engage, a survey Confidentiality Notice) relating to the degree of confidentiality and aggregation threshold that a Customer User will have and, if applicable, any required disclosures under any Data Protection Requirement (e.g., Art. 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation). At Customer’s option, Customer may use a default LinkedIn User Confidentiality Notice. Customer’s Master Admin will provide LinkedIn with the User Confidentiality Notice at least three (3) business days prior to use. Customer agrees that it will not modify or delete any portion of the User Confidentiality Notice or include any statements in any communication with a Customer User that imposes any obligation on LinkedIn or in any way modifies, contradicts, or supplements User Confidentiality Notice provided to LinkedIn. Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for ensuring that its use of Customer Personal Data and the User Confidentiality Notice complies with all applicable Data Protection Requirements._ 

**_The following clauses are added to the DPA as a new Section 4.4:_**

   _4.4 Aggregation and Non-Identification. To the extent a User Confidentiality Notice informs Customer Users that the Customer will only receive data from LinkedIn in an aggregated form, Customer agrees it will not receive, nor attempt to discern, any such Customer Personal Data in a form that identifies individual Customer Users with Customer Personal Data._

**_The first sentence of Section 5.1.a of the DPA is replaced with the following sentence:_**

   _Process Customer Personal Data (i) only for the purpose of providing, supporting and improving the Glint Services (including by providing aggregated, non-identifiable insights to improve the Glint Services and LinkedIn services, and providing survey benchmarking data to LinkedIn customers, where both the data subject and Customer have been de-identified), using appropriate technical and organizational security measures; and (ii) in compliance with the instructions received from Customer._ 

**_Section 5.1.g of the DPA is replaced in its entirety with the following clause:_**

   _Upon request, provide Customer with a summary of LinkedIn's security policies applicable to the Glint-branded services._

**_Section 8 of the DPA is replaced in its entirety with the following clauses:_**

   _The parties agree that on the termination of the data processing services, LinkedIn shall, and shall cause any Subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, unless Data Protection Requirements prevent LinkedIn from returning or destroying all or part of the Customer Personal Data disclosed: (i) return to Customer all the Customer Personal Data, including survey responses if the Customer User Confidentiality Notice disclosed Customer would receive responses identified to individuals, or (ii) securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures or (iii) export Customer Personal Data in a non-aggregated form to Customer’s new service provider under a separate written agreement reasonably satisfactory to LinkedIn under which Customer and the recipient of the data accept responsibility and liability for the Customer Personal Data subsequent to transfer or export.
