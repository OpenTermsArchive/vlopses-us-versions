LinkedIn law enforcement data request guidelines
------------------------------------------------

Last updated: 1 year ago

We know you count on us to safeguard your personal information, and to provide the transparency youâ€™ve come to expect, even when it comes to law enforcement requests for member data. We respect the laws that apply to our business operations, but we put our members first by requiring that such requests follow established legal procedures and by notifying members of requests for their data unless prohibited by statute or court order. We also believe in being transparent about the number and type of requests we receive, and we issue a [Transparency Report](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency) twice a year.

**How our process works:**

**Follow the Law**. Except in limited emergency situations, law enforcement agents seeking information about member accounts must be made through formal U.S. legal procedures, such as subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants. Please note that certain types of member data, including messages, invitations and connections, have a high bar for disclosure and can only be disclosed pursuant to a valid search warrant from an entity with proper jurisdiction.

Data requests from outside of the United States and the EU generally must be made through an official Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) or, letter rogatory.

**How Can Law Enforcement Officials Ask for Data?** All requests must include the agent's Badge/ID number, contact information, and must specify the member account by providing either (1) the full name of the member and email address associated with the account; or (2) the LinkedIn public profile URL. Data requests may be served by submitting the request via this link: [https://app.kodex.us/linkedin/signin](https://app.kodex.us/linkedin/signin) by certified mail, express courier, or in person at one of the following two locations below:

For all non-EU -based requests (includes U.S. requests):

LinkedIn Corporation  
ATTN: Legal Department  
1000 West Maude Avenue  
Sunnyvale, CA 94085  
USA

For all EU based requests:

LinkedIn Ireland U.C.  
ATTN: Legal Department  
Wilton Plaza  
Wilton Place, Dublin 2  
Ireland

**What if it's an emergency?** In very rare circumstances involving imminent serious bodily harm or death, we will consider responding to an emergency request for data. These requests must be submitted using the Emergency Disclosure Request Form included in LinkedIn's Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines, and must be signed under penalty of perjury by a law enforcement agent.
