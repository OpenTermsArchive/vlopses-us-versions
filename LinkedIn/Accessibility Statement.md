LinkedIn is a place where every member of the global workforce can find opportunity
===================================================================================

Whatever your goals, ideas, and abilities are, we’re here to help you succeed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No two LinkedIn members are the same—and it’s that diversity which makes our community so great.

We’re on a journey to make accessibility and inclusive design part of our core principles, building accessibility from the ground up and testing our products with assistive technology to make sure that everyone can use LinkedIn to advance their professional goals.

    Accessibility @ LinkedIn
    ------------------------
    
    As a Microsoft company, we've embraced digital inclusion, adopting the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) V2.2 Level AA in the design and development of our products.  
    
    As part of our commitment to accessibility we continuously audit our products—internally and through a third party—using assistive technology such as screen reading software (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver and TalkBack).
    
    LinkedIn is committed to meeting accessibility regulations around the world, including the European Accessibility Act. Accessibility conformance reports for LinkedIn Learning, which is in scope for the EAA, can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/accessibility/reports).
