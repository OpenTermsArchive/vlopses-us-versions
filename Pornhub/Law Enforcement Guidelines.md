Content Removal Request Form
============================

 Report Illegal or Abusive Content

Pornhub takes all content removal requests seriously, and our dedicated support team works around the clock to quickly process and remove content that violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms). We are committed to working to ensure that our community remains safe, inclusive, diverse, and strive to prevent and quickly respond to reports of abusive and illegal content. 

We encourage you to notify us immediately if you are aware of illegal, abusive, or other content that violates our Terms of Service by completing and submitting a [Content Removal Request](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal).  

You may submit content removal requests for the following: 

*   *   Violations of our [child sexual abuse material (CSAM) policy](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419869793683-Child-Sexual-Abuse-Material-Policy)  
    *   Violations of our [non-consensual content policy](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419871787027)  
    *   Withdrawal of performer consent from an existing agreement: Learn more about this in our [community guidelines](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines) 
    *   Violations of an existing performer consent agreement: Learn more about this in our [community guidelines](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines) 
    *   Otherwise illegal content 

**Note**: Content you wish to report may not be related to the reasons listed here. For additional reporting reasons, we encourage you to use our [Flagging](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419875025043-Report-Harmful-Content) feature. 

When filling out our [Content Removal Request Form](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal), we ask that you please include all relevant **URL links** as well as the reason and any additional context that you feel will assist us in reviewing your report.  A verification email will be sent to the email address you provide when submitting a content removal request. Upon verifying the email address, any content reported with a valid video URL(s) will be immediately suspended and unable to be shared or viewed on Pornhub pending further investigation. In certain instances, the uploader of the reported content may also be disabled while our review is in progress.

All content removal requests, whether verified by email or not, are reviewed and addressed expeditiously by our Trust & Safety team. If we determine that the incident is not related to content removal, it will be assigned to the appropriate team for review.

Your report is confidential.  When you report content, the user who posted the content will not see your name or any information about you if you opt out of sharing that information.  

For the purposes of our investigation, we may reach out to ask you for additional information, which may include verification images, identifying information about the uploader of the content, or other information to substantiate the report. This information is also confidential and for the purposes of our investigation only. Failure to supply the requested information could limit our team’s ability to thoroughly conduct the investigation. 

Please note that all official communication from our Trust & Safety team will be sent from the email domain @pornhub.com. We will never ask for sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or social security numbers.

When a content removal request is received, our Trust & Safety team conducts a thorough investigation to ensure the request is handled accurately and fairly. This process includes reviewing all information provided in the request, examining the content in question, and cross checking it against associated account details and documentation. As part of our standard verification procedures, we reference the identification information and consent records that are securely maintained for all performers. This allows us to confirm whether the content matches the verified performer(s) and that all required consent was obtained.

Content that cannot be verified, or that is found to violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), will be removed. Our Trust & Safety team cross-references the URL(s) provided with existing content on Pornhub to ensure all violative content is taken off of the platform. Violative content may also be fingerprinted to help identify and prevent its publication in case of re-upload to Pornhub in the future. If content is found to violate our [CSAM policy](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419869793683-Child-Sexual-Abuse-Material-Policy), [Non-Consensual Content policy](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419871787027-Non-Consensual-Content-Policy), or otherwise constitutes serious or repeated violations of our policies, the uploader will also be permanently banned from Pornhub. In cases where the content is confirmed to be compliant, it may be reinstated only after completing all necessary verification steps. Our team strives to provide you with an email at the conclusion of each content removal request investigation. 

Pornhub takes all removal requests seriously. Please be aware that abuse of this content removal request process hinders our team’s ability to process valid and actionable removal requests. Continued abuse may result in limitations with future reports.
