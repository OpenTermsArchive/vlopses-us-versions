Mental Health
=============

Pornhub is dedicated to the care, safety, and well-being of our models. That is why we also partner with [**Pineapple Support**](https://pineapplesupport.org/), an online mental health service developed specifically for adult industry models and performers.

As we know, ours can be a trying industry, with its own unique set of struggles. While stigma associated with the adult industry is slowly starting to change, we know that being a part of this community can make certain relationships, conversations and situations very complicated. It can even take a toll on your emotional health. That’s why we want help provide the resources you need to stay happy and healthy.

[Pineapple Support](https://pineapplesupport.org/) and Pornhub share a common goal – making sure that all sex workers and porn performers have access to the care they need.

[Pineapple Support](https://pineapplesupport.org/) provides 24/7 emotional support, meaning you’ll be able to chat anonymously, for free, with one of Pineapple’s Trained Listeners – they are specially trained to offer empathetic support, and listen to you without prejudice or stigma. Pineapple Support also provides free & subsidized emotional support and mental health care from licensed professionals to those working in the adult entertainment industry.

Sexual Wellness Center
======================

**Real talk** about sex from those who **know it best**.

Although pornography does not always represent sexual interactions and behaviors typical of every day life, and often depicts diverse fantasies and role-play by consenting amateurs and professionals, it can promote diverse sexual practices and allow individuals to explore their own sexuality and sexual preferences. That's why, in 2017, we decided to launch the [**Sexual Wellness Center**](https://www.pornhub.com/sex/),  under the direction of Dr. Laurie Betito. Our goal with the Sexual Wellness Center is to provide users with access to in-depth information and advice on love, sexuality, health, as well as the latest in sexuality research, and additional resources to healthy and secure approaches to various kinks and  more unconventional sexual practices.
