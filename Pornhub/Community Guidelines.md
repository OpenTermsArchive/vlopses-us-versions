Community Guidelines
====================

**August 2025**

Pornhub prides itself on being a safe space for our creators and users to upload and consume adult content. We take a number of steps to help protect the safety of our community and integrity of our platform, which is achieved in part by ensuring that all content that is uploaded to our platform adheres to our [**Terms of Service**](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms).

To help our users understand what is and what is not allowed on our platform, we have summarized our Terms of Service and related policies below. That summary is not an exhaustive list.

**Enforcement**

We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting the safety of our users. As a content sharing platform, Pornhub relies on technology, our team of human moderators, and our wider community of users to help identify violative content.

 **24/7 Human Moderation Team**

Our team of moderators and support staff work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to review all uploaded content for violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), address user concerns, and remove all content that we identify or which we are made aware of and deem as violating our policies and/or [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms). 

 **Community Oversight and Detection**

If you come across content, users, or comments that you think may violate these guidelines or otherwise be harmful for the community, you may [flag](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055147653-Report-Harmful-Content) this content to us for review. Content may also be reported to us via our [Content Removal Request](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal) form. 

 **Automated Tools**

In conjunction with our team of human moderators and regular audits of our platform, we also rely on innovative industry-standard technical tools to assist in identifying, reporting, and removing illegal and abusive content from our platform.

These technologies include:

*   *   [**Youtube’s CSAI Match**](https://www.youtube.com/csai-match/), a tool that assists in identifying known child sex abuse videos
    *   [**Microsoft’s PhotoDNA**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna), a tool that aids in detecting and removing known images of child sexual abuse
    *   [**Google's Content Safety API**](https://protectingchildren.google/intl/en/#introduction), a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tool that scores and prioritizes content based on the likelihood of illegal imagery to assist reviewers in detecting unknown CSAM
    *   [**Safer**](https://safer.io/ "https://safer.io/"), Thorn's comprehensive CSAM detection tool utilized to keep platforms free of abusive material
    *   **Instant Image Identifier:** The Centre for Expertise on Online Sexual Child Abuse ([Offlimits](https://www.eokm.nl/)) tool, commissioned by the European Commission, detects known child abuse imagery using a triple verified database.
    *   **MediaWise®** service from [Vobile](https://www.vobilegroup.com/)®, a state-of-the-art fingerprinting software and database, which scans all new user uploads to help prevent previously identified offending content from being re-uploaded.
    *   **[NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/) Hash Sharing:** NCMEC’s database of known CSAM hashes, including hashes submitted by individuals who fingerprinted their own underage content via NCMEC’s [Take It Down](https://takeitdown.ncmec.org/) service. 
    *   **[Internet Watch Foundation](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) (IWF) Hash List:** IWF’s database of known CSAM, sourced from hotline reports and the UK Home Office’s Child Abuse Image Database.
    *   **[StopNCII.org](https://stopncii.org/)**: A global initiative (developed by Meta & SWGfL) that prevents the spread of non-consensual intimate images (NCII) online. If any adult (18+) is concerned about their intimate images (or videos) being shared online without consent, they can create a digital fingerprint of their own material and prevent it from being shared across participating platforms. 
    *   **Safeguard:** our proprietary image fingerprinting and recognition technology designed with the purpose of combatting both child sexual abuse imagery and the distribution of non-consensual intimate images, and to help prevent the re-uploading of that content to our platform.
    *   **Age Estimation:** We also utilize age estimation capabilities to analyze content uploaded to our platform using a combination of internal proprietary software and external technology in an effort to strengthen the varying methods we use to prevent the upload and publication of potential or actual CSAM.
    *   **Transcription Service**: Our transcription service transcribes the audio in uploaded videos to text. Transcribed text is then run against our list of banned words to assist our moderation team in identifying content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) or these guidelines. 
        
    *   **Watermark Detection Service**: We utilize internal proprietary technology to detect watermarks identified in violative content to assist in identifying and removing new or related uploads of this content.
        

Together, these tools play a fundamental role in our shared fight against the dissemination of abusive content on our platform.

**Consequences for Violating these Guidelines**

We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting the safety of our users. As a content sharing platform, Pornhub relies on technology, our team of human moderators, and our wider community of users to help identify violative content.

Where we identify or are made aware of content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) and/or Community Guidelines, our dedicated team works swiftly to review and remove any violative content.

Depending on the findings, our team may also:

*   *   Utilize sophisticated industry-standard tools to fingerprint the content in question to block future uploads of the same content to our sites
    *   Suspend or permanently terminate the associated user’s account, where appropriate

In addition to the above, if content violates our [child sexual abuse material policy](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419869793683-Child-Sexual-Abuse-Material-Policy), it will be reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (**[NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/)**).

Hate Speech Policy
==================

**July 2023**

Pornhub offers the adult community an open, expressive, safe, and diverse space for an array of legal sexual content, expression, and kinks. To ensure the safety of that space, we do not tolerate hate speech in any form.

One of our [core values](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419871944723-Core-Values) is inclusivity, and hate speech threatens community safety. Hate speech has no place on our platform, and we are committed to its eradication.   

Our hate speech policy is designed to help educate our community of users and to protect our platform from violence.

**What is speech and what is hate speech?**

We consider speech as any form of published communication on, to, or via the platform. We define hate speech as any communication or material that promotes, calls for, supports, or advocates for the **delegitimization, dehumanization, discrimination, segregation, detestation, or vilification** of a person or group of persons by reason of the fact that they are identifiable on the basis of protected characteristics.

At its most _extreme_, hate speech **calls for, threatens, or promotes violence** against people that are identifiable on the basis of protected characteristics**.**

**Protected Characteristics**

For the purposes of the policy, protected characteristics are defined as follows: 

*   Age
*   Sexual Orientation
*   Sex
*   Gender
*   Gender Identity
*   Ethnicity 
*   Race
*   National origin
*   Religion 
*   Caste
*   Serious disease
*   Disability
*   Immigration status

**Guideline**

As always, don't post content if you think it _might_ violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms). We reserve the right to remove content at our sole discretion that we believe violates our Policies or Terms of Service.

Do **NOT** upload, post, or otherwise communicate content that threatens, advocates, justifies, promotes, or displays any of the following:

*   Physical or sexual violence against any persons on the basis of protected characteristics; violence toward organizations or target (building/institution/territory)
*   Any sign, symbol, slogan, emblem, text, flag, hand gesture, or poster associated with any group, person, or organization that proclaims a violent and/or hateful mission (e.g. known terrorist organizations listed by the UN Security Council Consolidated List)
*   Any group, person, or organization that proclaims as its mission or is otherwise generally accepted or known to be associated with violence, threatening, calling for, promoting, or advocating of hate toward persons based on protected characteristics
*   Speech which expresses the belittlement, de-humanization, vilification, segregation or banishment of a person or group; denial or minimization of a persecution of a person or group
*   Stereotypes, tropes, expressions, slurs, and/or epithets, including other words or phrases used pejoratively toward or in reference to persons based on protected characteristics, regardless of the intended audience\*;

**Freedom of Expression**

We recognize that sometimes the line between permitted speech and hate speech will be difficult to draw.

You may not like everything you see, read, or hear on Pornhub. However, this does not mean that such content constitutes hate speech. It is important to remember that other forms of expression, while repugnant, offensive, weird, or distasteful to some, do not always rise to the level of hateful expression. Context also plays a role in our assessment of hate speech.

The following are acceptable as long they adhere to our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms):

*   Humiliation play as a fetish is allowed so long as it does not involve any form of hateful expression (see above);
*   Role-play is acceptable so long as it does not promote, glorify, justify, or incite violence, dehumanization, or vilification of a person or group of persons, on the basis of protected characteristics;
*   Slurs used self-referentially and/or in an empowering way, and where additional context is provided to be able to clearly distinguish intent and which is not employed excessively;
*   Any of the above prohibitions when it is clear to the reasonable observer that the content is intended as satire or has educational merit;

**Enforcement**

We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting the safety of our users. As a content sharing platform, Pornhub relies on technology, our team of human moderators, and our wider community of users to help identify violative content. We also actively cooperate with law-enforcement investigations and promptly respond to valid legal requests received in order to assist in combating the dissemination of non-consensual recordings and distribution on the Pornhub platform.

  **24/7 Human Moderation Team**

Our team of moderators and support staff work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to review all uploaded content for violations, address user concerns, and remove all content that we identify or of which we are made aware of and deem as constituting hate speech.

  **Community Oversight and Detection**

We always encourage our community of users who come across content that is suspected to violate our guidelines to alert us by filling out and submitting our Content Removal Request form as soon as possible so that we may take appropriate and swift action. If you are a registered user, if you come across content, users, or comments that you think may be harmful for the community, you may also flag them to us for review.

    **Automated Tools**

Digitally fingerprinting unauthorized content can serve as an added layer of protection against previously identified and actioned infringing content from being re-uploaded on our platform. We use the MediaWise® service from Vobile®, a third-party digital fingerprinting system, to assist us in identifying and blocking previously identified unauthorized content that has been fingerprinting from being uploaded by users, as well as our own proprietary digital fingerprinting tool, Safeguard. Content that we identify and remove for violating our hate speech guideline is digitally fingerprinted using our third-party digital fingerprinting service provider, Vobile, and our proprietary fingerprinting tool, Safeguard. Digitally fingerprinting unauthorized content can serve as an added layer of protection against further distribution of said content on our platform.

**Consequences of Violating this Policy**

In all cases where we identify or are made aware of content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) and Community Guidelines, our dedicated team works swiftly to review and remove any violative content.

Depending on the findings, our team may also:

*   Utilize sophisticated industry-standard tools to fingerprint the content in question to block potential future uploads of the same content to our sites; AND
*   Suspend or permanently terminate the associated user’s account, where appropriate.
