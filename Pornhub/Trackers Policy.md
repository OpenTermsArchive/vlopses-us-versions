=============

**Last Modified:** 5th January 2026

This Cookie Notice applies for cookies and other similar technologies which may be placed when you visit different pages on [www.pornhub.com](http://www.pornhub.com/) (the “Website”) which is operated by Aylo Freesites Ltd (hereinafter “we” or “us”). In this Cookie Notice we explain what cookies are, how we use them and how you can manage them.

### What are cookies? 

A cookie is a small piece of data that, when browsing a website, will ask your browser to collect and store on your computer or internet-compatible end user devices for example, smartphones and tablets (collectively “Computer”) in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference, online activity, or login credentials (collectively “cookies”).   

First and Third-Party Cookies. The cookies set by us are called first party cookies. We also use third-party cookies, which are cookies from a domain different than our Website. Both types of cookies are text files made up of bits of information that websites use to collect your user data. First-party cookies are mostly used to improve your user experience by remembering user preferences and settings, also used to store information, such as usernames, passwords, and language preferences. Third-party cookies track your browsing history and activities so that we can show you targeted or personalized ads and marketing related to our content, products, and services.  

Session and Persistent Cookies. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you quit your browser. A persistent cookie will be saved on your Computer until it expires, or until you delete your cookies. Each cookie has a different expiration date; some may expire after a few minutes while others after some years.

Local storage can be used to maintain preferences, a history of usage, or even the state or settings of a site or an app. Local storage may be used to improve your experience with our Website for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences, and improving our Website’s functionality.    

The main difference between Cookies and Local storage is how they function, cookies are sent to the webserver with your requests while Local storage can only be read by your browser.  

### How we use cookies

### Third Party Cookies 

Third party cookies originate from a domain different to the Website. For example, when you visit the Website, some content or applications, including advertisements, may link to a third-party website.  

These third parties may set cookies on your computer to collect information about you, such as your IP address or location, when you click to view, access, or use any of their features on the Website. Unless expressly stated otherwise, we do not share any personal information with these third parties or control how these third parties use their cookies, so we suggest you check their website to see how they're using them and how you can manage them. You can set your browser to refuse all third-party cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals. 

### Google Analytics 

We use Google as a service provider to collect and analyse information about how users use the Website, including by collecting website activity data through first-party cookies set by our domains, and third-party cookies set by Google. Because we activated IP anonymization for Google Analytics, Google will anonymize the last octet of a particular IP address and will not store your full IP address. Google will use the information only to provide Google Analytics services to us and will not use this information for other purposes. In addition, Pornhub uses Google Signals, which are also services provided by Google that help us to run remarketing campaigns, collect more accurate data, and understand in a better way how users engage with Pornhub on different devices (cross-device activity). Google Signals apply to Google users who accept personalized advertising on their Google accounts. 

You can learn more on how Google uses data [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). You can opt-out of Google Analytics by visiting the [Google Analytics opt-out page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or by accepting only essential cookies.
