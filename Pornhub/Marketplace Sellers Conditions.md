Model Agreement
===============

The Model Program sign-up process is secure and confidential. All information and IDs submitted via the sign-up process are only visible to Pornhub Staff.

You are required to maintain all appropriate records as required by your legal jurisdiction for all performers who appear in all content. Once you have completed the Primary Model Agreement, you will be able to fill out [Co-Performer Agreements](https://ei.mainhubcdn.com/docs/Consent%20and%20Release%20Agreement.pdf) for all of your Performers.

**Please note, Co-Performer is required for all performers featured in new video uploads.** 

The first agreement you fill out will be considered your _Primary Model Agreement_. 

Once your information is provided you will have to upload 1 piece of government-issued ID. See below to for info on which cards and documents are accepted. We may request a second piece of ID. 

 You will also have to **read** and **agree** to the following:

*   Age performer release
*   Affidavit  
*   Terms of use
*   Privacy policy 

Your acknowledgment and agreeance is submitted via an electronic signature. The electronic signature is space and case sensitive and must match your full legal name inputted in the Model Agreement Form. Currently, it must be in English as other language characters are not supported. 

Ex:

Legal Name: Jane Doe

(no spaces between or after the two letters)

**What type of IDs are accepted?** 

In order to be eligible for payments in the Model Payment Program, we need a high-res image or scan of minimum one piece of ID for each performer. Please note: it does NOT matter whether they do not show their face, if someone is in the video, they MUST have IDs. 

Your ID must be a government-issued photo ID which indicates your birthdate. 

Examples for ID

*   Driver's license
*   Passport
*   Proof of age card
*   Health card
*   State ID
*   Uniformed services ID

**\*NOTE\*** We do not accept copies of IDs saved as screenshots on smartphones or pictures taken from a computer monitor. 

Will there be other performers in your videos? Once you have completed the Primary Model Agreement, you will be able to fill out [Additional Model Agreements](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/22370181992083-Working-with-Co-Performers) for all of your performers!

**Electronic signature and initials**

When you sign up for the [Model Program](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419879760403-How-to-Sign-Up-and-Join-the-Model-Program), you will be asked to include your electronic signature and initials. When this occurs, be sure to only use the English alphabet as other language characters are not supported. 

As for initials, you must only include the first letter of your first name followed by the first letter of your last name. 

For example, if your name is _Jane Doe_, your initials are _JD._ Do not include middle name initials. 

If you have a two-word family name, your initials will depend on whether there is a hyphen or not. 

Example: _Jane Jones-Doe_, your initials would be _JJ_

Example: _Jane Jones Doe_, your initials would be _JD_

**Why won't my electronic signature work?**

The electronic signature must match the full legal name that your entered in the Model Agreement. It is case and space sensitive. 

If you are having issues submitting your Model Agreement, double check to make sure your electronic signature is correct. We suggest copy pasting what you submitted as your full name to ensure there are no missing characters/spaces.

**How long does the approval take?**

Once you have submitted your Primary Model Agreement along with your photo ID, it will take up to 72 hours for the application to be processed.

You will receive an email once the application has been approved or rejected. If your application was rejected, you will receive an email letting you know what went wrong and how to reapply. 

**How do I check the status of my Model Agreement application?**
