Non-Consensual Content Policy
=============================

**December 2025**

Consent, as a rule and [value](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041768014-Core-Values), is paramount to the security of our users and integrity of our platform.

We require all uploaders to affirm they have obtained and maintain valid consent and proper release documentation for all persons featured in all content uploaded to the platform. In addition, content must adhere to our [core values](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041768014-Core-Values), community guidelines, as well as our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms).

Content that we identify as a violation of our Non-Consensual Content Policy will be removed, and the associated user’s account actioned accordingly.

**What is considered a violation of our non-consensual content policy:**

The recording or distribution of intimate images (that is, photos and videos that are generally understood to depict explicit sexual activity or nudity or partial nudity) without someone’s consent is a violation of that person’s privacy and is a severe violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), and is **strictly prohibited**. Content featuring or promoting non-consensual acts, real or simulated, is also prohibited.

**Guidelines** 

**Do NOT** use the platform to upload, post, or otherwise share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of the people involved. Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to**\***:

*   Videos or photos of any person, whether in a public or private setting, without that person’s valid written consent (such as hidden/spy camera content, or up-skirt content);
    
*   Sharing explicit sexual images of someone else without their valid written consent (this would include, namely: non-consensual distribution of intimate images, also commonly referred to as “revenge porn”);
    
*   Sharing non-sexually explicit images of someone else without their valid written consent;
    
*   “Doxing”, defined as exposing private and identifying information about a particular individual, including phone number, e-mail, address, or full name.
    

To help protect the integrity of the platform, we also **prohibit** content, including fictional, simulated, or animated, that features or depicts\*:

*   Depictions of non-consensual sexual activity\*, including coerced or forced sexual acts, rape, or sexual assault;
*   Persons appearing drugged, incapacitated, or intoxicated\*\* involved in sexual acts;
*   Any “deepfakes” whatsoever (AI-generated, modified, or other manipulations of a person’s image, whether in picture or video, to deceive or mislead the viewer into believing that person is acting or speaking in the way presented).

\* See our section below on _Sensitive Themes and Considerations for Consent_.

\*\* Intoxicated (including pretending to be) means a state induced by alcohol or drugs, whether legal, illicit, or recreational as determined by Pornhub in its sole discretion, such that a performer’s judgment appears to the reasonable observer as objectively impaired.

**Sensitive Themes and Consideration for Consent** 

It is important to remember that pornography does not always represent sexual interactions and behaviors typical of everyday life, and often depicts diverse fantasies and role-play scenarios by consenting amateurs and professionals. In all cases, whether professional or amateur, we expect content to adhere to Pornhub's [core values](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041768014-Core-Values) and [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms).

When reviewing content depicting the sensitive themes listed below, we take the following into consideration to determine whether it violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms). We recommend reviewing our detailed policy before uploading content involving these sensitive themes. Consent must be determinable by the reasonable observer from the material itself, which may be assessed either through clear verbal or visual cues.

Note that we consider many factors to distinguish fantasy from reality. The following is a non-exhaustive list of what we consider sensitive themes. Accordingly, content engaging with the following themes is subject to removal, and appropriate account enforcement, where found to be in violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms):

*   **Spells, Mesmerizing, or Possession**: We do not permit content where:
    *   A performer is depicted as incapacitated, or otherwise completely unconscious because of possession, spells, or mesmerizing;
    *   Performers display signs of distress or panic during or after the act; or
    *   Realistic depictions of spellbound, mesmerized, or possessed performers engaged in or subjected to sexual acts.
*   **Sleep**: Where there is a component of sleep in the content, the person must wake up within a reasonable time from the start of any sexual act(s) and consent must be made clear by that person.
*   **Bondage and Restraints**: If a scene features the use of a gag, restraint(s), or other device(s) that would render a performer unable to clearly speak or move, consent to continued participation must be clearly determinable from the material itself, or where it cannot be, consent must be clearly determinable through other visual or verbal cues.
*   **Sub-Dom Fantasies**: Consent must be determinable from the material itself, through clear verbal or visual cues.

To be clear, our rules with respect to these sensitive themes are not a judgment on these forms of sexual expression but aim to make clear what is or is not acceptable on our platform, to maintain a safe community.

**Enforcement** 

We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting the safety of our users. As a content sharing platform, Pornhub relies on technology, our team of human moderators, and our wider community of users to help identify violative content. We also actively cooperate with law-enforcement investigations and promptly respond to valid legal requests received in order to assist in combating the dissemination of non-consensual recordings and distribution on the Pornhub platform.

  **24/7 Human Moderation Team**

Our team of moderators and support staff work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to review all uploaded content for violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), address user concerns, and remove all non-consensual content that we identify or of which we are made aware.

  **Community Oversight and Detection**

Detecting non-consensual images at the time of upload is complex. While we use technology to combat the distribution of non-consensual intimate images and videos, we also rely on people proactively reporting that type of content to us. As such, members of our community play an important role in helping to secure the integrity and safety of our platform.

If you have first-hand knowledge of content on the platform that violates these guidelines, or is otherwise illegal and abusive, you may alert us by filling out and submitting our [Content Removal Request Form](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal) as soon as possible so that we can take appropriate and swift action.

If you are a registered user, if you come across content, users, or comments that you think may be harmful for the community, you may also [flag](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055147653-Report-Harmful-Content) them to us for review. 

  **Automated Tools**

In conjunction with our team of human moderators and regular audits of our platform, we also rely on innovative industry-standard technical tools to assist in identifying, reporting, and removing illegal and abusive content from our platform.

These technologies include:

*   [**StopNCII.org**](https://stopncii.org/): A global initiative (developed by Meta & SWGfL) that prevents the spread of non-consensual intimate images (NCII) online. If any adult (18+) is concerned about their intimate images (or videos) being shared online without consent, they can create a digital fingerprint of their own material and prevent it from being shared across participating platforms. 
*   **MediaWise®** service from [Vobile](https://www.vobilegroup.com/)®, a state-of-the-art fingerprinting software and database, which scans all new user uploads to help prevent previously identified offending content from being re-uploaded.
*   **Safeguard:** Our proprietary image fingerprinting and recognition technology designed with the purpose of combatting both child sexual abuse imagery and the distribution of non-consensual intimate images, and to help prevent the re-uploading of that content to our platform.
*   **Watermark Detection Service**: We utilize internal proprietary technology to detect watermarks identified in violative content to assist in identifying and removing new or related uploads of this content.
    
*   **Transcription Service**: Our transcription service transcribes the audio in uploaded videos to text. Transcribed text is then run against our list of banned words to assist our moderation team in identifying content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines). 
    

We encourage users who have content in which they are featured, and who wish to prevent the upload of such content to our platform, to consider proactively digitally fingerprinting it.

If you are interested in having your content digitally fingerprinted by Vobile you may contact them directly via [https://vobile.com/about/contact/](https://vobile.com/about/contact/). 

  Should you wish to remove content that you: appear in and did not consent to have made and/or shared; OR content that is illegal and/or otherwise violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), please [**report it to us**](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal).

**Consequences for Violating this Policy** 

In all cases where we identify or are made aware of content that violates this policy, our Trust & Safety and Moderation teams work swiftly to:

*   Review and remove infringing content;
*   Fingerprint the content in question to help block future uploads of the same content to our sites; AND
*   Suspend or permanently terminate the associated uploader's account, where appropriate. 

**How Can You Help Us?** 

If you believe you have come across non-consensual content, or any other content that otherwise violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), we strongly encourage you to immediately alert us by [flagging](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055147653-Report-Harmful-Content) the content for our review.

If you are the victim or have first-hand knowledge that content violates our Non-Consensual Content policy, please report the content to us by completing and submitting our [**CONTENT REMOVAL REQUEST FORM**](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal). Please include all relevant URL links to the content in question and we will address your request confidentially and remove the content expeditiously.

Anyone can report violations of this policy using our [CONTENT REMOVAL REQUEST FORM](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal), whether they have an account on our platform or not.

Our Commitment to Trust and Safety
==================================

At Pornhub, nothing is more important than the safety of our community and the trust of our users. Our core values, such as inclusivity and freedom of expression, are only possible when our platform maintains its safety and integrity and can be trusted by our adult users, as well as our business and content partners. We remain steadfast in our commitment to eliminating illegal content, including non-consensual intimate material and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Every online platform shares this responsibility, and it requires collective action, cooperation, and constant vigilance.

Over the years, we have deployed many measures to protect our platform from illegal and abusive content. We are continually improving our Trust and Safety policies to better identify, remove, review, and report illegal material, both before being made available on our platforms and once reported to us. While leading non-profit and advocacy groups recognize that our efforts have been effective, we understand that our efforts must be ongoing and always strive to innovate.

In early 2020, we voluntarily registered to report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) as part of their ESP program. In the spring of 2021, we issued our first transparency report, which provides more information about our approach to moderation, related policies, partnerships and Trust and Safety efforts. [Transparency Reports](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/sections/5357288459027-Transparency-Reports) are now published on a semi-annual basis. Further details on our policies can be found below.

We also took additional steps to further protect our community, including banning content downloads and restricting the ability to upload to verified uploaders only. We continue to build upon our verification and moderation efforts through tools, technology, and partnerships, as they become available.

Members of our Trusted Flagger Program, which now includes dozens of non-profit organizations, may alert us of potential CSAM or non-consensual content. Pornhub users may also alert us to potentially abusive material by using our user, content, and comment flagging features. Users may alert us to content that may be illegal or otherwise violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) by using the flagging feature found below all videos and photos, or by filling out our [Content Removal Request](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal) (CRR) form.  Flags and CRRs are kept confidential, and we review all content that is brought to our attention by users through these means.

**1\.** **Verified Content Creators**

Only verified content creators may upload content to Pornhub. 

**Who are "Verified Content Creators?"**

Verified content creators include the following groups:

*   Verified Models within the [Model Program](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419879760403-How-to-Sign-Up-and-Join-the-Model-Program-)
*   Verified Studios within the [Content Partner Program](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419878848019-What-is-the-Content-Partner-Program-)

**How Can Content Creators Get Verified?**

Our Content Partners maintain proof of ID, age and consent for all performers who are featured in content uploaded to Pornhub.

To become a member of the Model Program, the user must verify their age and identity before they are eligible to upload content to Pornhub. Members of the Model Program must also obtain, retain, and provide identification and evidence of consent to record and distribute for every performer appearing in their content before their content is uploaded to Pornhub. This requires the Model or Co-Performer to submit the following prior to upload:

*   Government-issued photo identification for all performers
*   Consent documentation, such as signed Release Forms, for all performers appearing in content uploaded to Pornhub

To learn more about joining the Model Program, click [here](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419879760403-How-to-Sign-Up-and-Join-the-Model-Program-).

To learn more about our trusted third-party identification verification service, click [here](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/19159382668435-Trust-and-Safety-Initiatives).

**2\.** **Banning Downloads**

We have removed the ability for users to download content from Pornhub. In tandem with our fingerprinting technology, this will help prevent previously removed content from being re-uploaded.

**3\.** **Content Moderation**

We use a combination of automated tools, artificial intelligence, and human review to help protect our community from illegal content. While all content is reviewed prior to going live on the platform, we also have additional layers of moderation, which audit our live sites by proactively sweeping content already uploaded for potential violations and identifying any breakdowns in the moderation process that could allow a piece of content that violates our Terms of Service to be available on our platform.

Additionally, while our list of banned keywords on Pornhub is already extensive, we continue to ban new keywords on an ongoing basis. We also regularly monitor search terms within the platform for increases in phrasing that attempt to bypass the safeguards in place and adapt our banned keywords accordingly.

Pornhub's content moderation process includes an extensive team of human moderators dedicated to manually reviewing every single upload before it is published, a thorough system for flagging, reviewing, and removing illegal material, parental controls, and the utilization of a variety of automated detection technologies for known and previously identified, or potentially inappropriate content. These technologies include:

*   **CSAI Match**: YouTube’s proprietary [technology](https://www.youtube.com/csai-match/) for combating Child Sexual Abuse Imagery online.
*   **Google Content Safety API**: Google's [artificial intelligence tool](https://protectingchildren.google/intl/en/) that helps detect illegal imagery.
*   **PhotoDNA**: [Microsoft’s technology](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna) that aids in finding and removing known images of child exploitation.
*   **MediaWise**: [Vobile](https://www.vobilegroup.com/)’s fingerprinting software that scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorized materials to protect against banned videos being re-uploaded to the platform.
*   **Safer**: In November 2020, we became the first adult content platform to partner with [Thorn](https://www.thorn.org/), allowing us to begin using its [Safer](https://safer.io/) product on Pornhub, adding an additional layer of protection in our robust compliance and content moderation process. Safer joins the list of technologies that Pornhub utilizes to help protect visitors from unwanted or illegal material.
*   **Instant Image Identifier**: The Centre for Expertise on Online Sexual Child Abuse ([Offlimits](https://offlimits.nl/)) tool, commissioned by the European Commission, detects known child abuse imagery using a triple verified database.
*   **[NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/) Hash Sharing**: NCMEC’s database of known CSAM hashes, including hashes submitted by individuals who fingerprinted their own underage content via NCMEC’s [Take It Down](https://takeitdown.ncmec.org/) service.
*   **[Internet Watch Foundation](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) (IWF) Hash List**: IWF’s database of known CSAM, sourced from hotline reports and the UK Home Office’s Child Abuse Image Database.
*   **[StopNCII.org](https://www.stopncii.org/)**: A global initiative (developed by Meta & SWGfL) that prevents the spread of non-consensual intimate images (NCII) online. If any adult (18+) is concerned about their intimate images (or videos) being shared online without consent, they can create a digital fingerprint of their own material and prevent it from being shared across participating platforms.
*   **Safeguard**: Safeguard is Pornhub’s proprietary image recognition technology designed with the purpose of combatting both child sexual abuse imagery and non-consensual content, by preventing the re-uploading of previously fingerprinted content to our platform.
*   **Age Estimation**: We also utilize age estimation capabilities to analyze content uploaded to our platform using a combination of internal proprietary software and external technology in an effort to strengthen the varying methods we use to prevent the upload and publication of potential or actual CSAM.
*   **Transcription Service**: Our transcription service transcribes the audio in uploaded videos to text. Transcribed text is then run against our list of banned words to assist our moderation team in identifying content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines).
*   **Watermark Detection Service**: We utilize internal proprietary technology to detect watermarks identified in violative content to assist in identifying and removing new or related uploads of this content.

Users may alert us to content that may be illegal or otherwise violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) by using the flagging feature, found below all videos and photos, or by filling out our [Content Removal Request](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal) form.

**4\. Trusted Flagger Program**

Our [Trusted Flagger Program](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419879221907) is an initiative to empower non-profit and NGO partners to alert us of content they believe violates our Terms of Service. The Trusted Flagger Program consists of more than 40 leading organizations in internet and child safety. Our partners have a direct line of access to our moderation team, and any content identified by a Trusted Flagger is immediately disabled. Members of the Trusted Flagger Program include: Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (United States of America), National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (United States of America), Internet Watch Foundation (United Kingdom), Point de Contact (France), Centre for Safer Internet Slovenia (Slovenia), ECPAT (Sweden), ECPAT (Taiwan).

**5\.** **NCMEC Reporting**

In early 2020, Pornhub voluntarily registered with NCMEC’s ESP program as part of an initiative to set up an automated reporting system for content that violates our [CSAM policy](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419869793683). We will also continue to work with law enforcement globally to report and curb any instances involving illegal content.

**6\.** **Transparency Reporting**

Our [Transparency Reports](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/sections/5357288459027-Transparency-Reports) enable the public to better understand not only how we strive to keep our platform safe, but how we as a company are actively contributing to the fight against illegal and abusive content. These reports expand on our proactive and defensive strategies to prevent, detect, and remove illegal content, as well as content moderation results for the respective year.   

Much like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other tech platforms, Pornhub seeks to be fully transparent about the data pertaining to violative content uploads and the quantitative results of our Trust and Safety efforts to prevent such material from appearing on our platform. We take pride in the fact that we are the first the adult platform to release a Transparency Report, having published our inaugural report in April 2021. We will continue to release these reports on an annual basis.

Trust and Safety Initiatives
============================

**June 2025**

Our goal to achieve and set the highest level of Trust and Safety standards relies heavily on not only our internal policies and moderation team, but also on our array of external partnerships and technology. We have compiled a list of tools, Trust and Safety initiatives, and partnerships to provide more information about how we work to prevent and respond to illegal content on our platform, as well as ensuring user safety. 

**Content Scanning and Classification Tools**

We utilize a number of external and internal tools to identify and remove potentially illegal content. These technologies include: 

*   **CSAI Match**: YouTube’s proprietary [technology](https://www.youtube.com/csai-match/) for combating Child Sexual Abuse Imagery online.
*   **Google Content Safety API**: Google's [artificial intelligence tool](https://protectingchildren.google/intl/en/) that helps detect illegal imagery.
*   **PhotoDNA**: [Microsoft’s technology](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna) that aids in finding and removing known images of child exploitation.
*   **MediaWise**: [Vobile](https://www.vobilegroup.com/)’s fingerprinting software that scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorized materials to protect against banned videos being re-uploaded to the platform.
*   **Safer**: In November 2020, we became the first adult content platform to partner with [Thorn](https://www.thorn.org/), allowing us to begin using its [Safer](https://safer.io/) product on Pornhub, adding an additional layer of protection in our robust compliance and content moderation process. Safer joins the list of technologies that Pornhub utilizes to help protect visitors from unwanted or illegal material.
*   **Instant Image Identifier**: The Centre for Expertise on Online Sexual Child Abuse ([Offlimits](https://www.eokm.nl/)) tool, commissioned by the European Commission, detects known child abuse imagery using a triple verified database.
*   **[NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/) Hash Sharing**: NCMEC’s database of known CSAM hashes, including hashes submitted by individuals who fingerprinted their own underage content via NCMEC’s [Take It Down](https://takeitdown.ncmec.org/) service.
*   **[Internet Watch Foundation](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) (IWF) Hash List**: IWF’s database of known CSAM, sourced from hotline reports and the UK Home Office’s Child Abuse Image Database.
*   **[StopNCII.org](https://stopncii.org/)**: A global initiative (developed by Meta & SWGfL) that prevents the spread of non-consensual intimate images (NCII) online. If any adult (18+) is concerned about their intimate images (or videos) being shared online without consent, they can create a digital fingerprint of their own material and prevent it from being shared across participating platforms. 
*   **Safeguard**: Safeguard is Pornhub’s proprietary image recognition technology designed with the purpose of combatting both child sexual abuse imagery and non-consensual content, by preventing the re-uploading of previously fingerprinted content to our platform.
*   **Age Estimation**: We also utilize age estimation capabilities to analyze content uploaded to our platform using a combination of internal proprietary software and external technology in an effort to strengthen the varying methods we use to prevent the upload and publication of potential or actual CSAM.
*   **Transcription Service**: Our transcription service transcribes the audio in uploaded videos to text. Transcribed text is then run against our list of banned words to assist our moderation team in identifying content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines). 
    
*   **Watermark Detection Service**: We utilize internal proprietary technology to detect watermarks identified in violative content to assist in identifying and removing new or related uploads of this content.
    

Pornhub remains vigilant when it comes to researching, adopting, and using the latest and best available detection technology to help make it a safe platform, while remaining an inclusive, sex positive online space for adults.

**Partnerships**

**The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) Partnership**

The IWF is a technology-led, child protection organization, making the internet a safer place for children and adults across the world. They are one of the largest child protection organizations globally.

In November 2022, we [announced a partnership](https://www.iwf.org.uk/news-media/news/model-of-good-practice-for-adult-sector-to-be-developed-by-iwf-and-mindgeek/) with the IWF overseen by an Expert Advisory Board including the  [British Board of Film Classification](https://www.bbfc.co.uk/), [SWGfL](https://swgfl.org.uk/), [Aylo](https://www.aylo.com/), [Marie Collins Foundation](https://www.mariecollinsfoundation.org.uk/), the [Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office), [PA Consulting](https://www.paconsulting.com/), [National Crime Agency](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/) (NCA) and academia represented by [Middlesex University](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/) and [Exeter University](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), to:

*   Develop a model of good practice to guide the adult industry in combatting child sexual abuse imagery online;
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of IWF services when deployed across Aylo’s brands;
*   Combine technical and engineering expertise to scope and develop solutions which will assist with the detection, disruption and removal of child sexual abuse material online.

In May 2024, Aylo and the IWF published the world’s first standards of good practice for adult content sites -  [Aylo and IWF partnership ‘paves the way’ for adult sites to join war on child sexual abuse online](https://www.iwf.org.uk/news-media/news/aylo-and-iwf-partnership-paves-the-way-for-adult-sites-to-join-war-on-child-sexual-abuse-online/)

**The reThink Chatbot**

Building upon our efforts to spread awareness about the harm of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and to deter users from searching for this kind of content, [we launched the reThink Chatbot](https://www.pornhub.com/press/show?id=2331) in partnership with the [Internet Watch Foundation](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) and [Stop it Now](https://www.stopitnow.org/) in March of 2022. The reThink chatbot engages with Pornhub users attempting to search for sexual imagery of children and signposts them to Stop It Now! UK and Ireland where they can receive help and support to address their behavior.

**The results were independently evaluated by the University of Tasmania and [published in February 2024](https://www.iwf.org.uk/about-us/why-we-exist/our-research/rethink-chatbot-evaluation/). They showed that the Chabot was successful in reducing the number of searches for child sexual abuse material.**

**Spectrum Labs AI**

We have been working with [Spectrum Labs AI](https://www.spectrumlabsai.com/) to proactively surface and remove harmful text on our platforms. This drives productivity and accuracy of our internal moderation teams and tooling.

**Trust & Safety Professional Association** 

In 2023, we became members of the Trust and Safety Professional Association ([TSPA](https://www.tspa.org/)), an organization which works to serve as a global community for Trust and Safety teams and individuals. TSPA offers Trust and Safety teams the opportunity to collaborate and share information to assist in developing best practices related to Trust and Safety on online platforms.

**The Cupcake Girls Partnership**

[The Cupcake Girls](https://www.thecupcakegirls.org/) are an organization that provides advocacy and referral services to consensual sex workers, as well as prevention and aftercare services to those affected by sex trafficking. 

Uniting The Cupcake Girls expertise in supporting sex workers with our technology and educational resources, this powerful new partnership will drive meaningful change for our community. By sharing resources—ranging from collective collaborations to data insights—and by engaging with sex workers, the goal is to support consensual sex workers and foster an environment where their safety and success is prioritized.

**Age Determination - Thorn, Teleperformance & ICMEC**

In May 2024 Teleperformance published a paper on age determination that we co-authored with Thorn, Teleperformance and the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC). [Age Determination - A Guide for Online Platforms that Feature User-Generated Content (teleperformance.com)](https://www.teleperformance.com/en-us/insights-list/reports/age-determination-a-best-practice-guide-for-online-platforms-that-feature-user-generated-content/)

We provided insights from our in-house moderation team in co-writing the paper which explores the intricate process of age determination within user-generated content on online platforms, shedding light on the pivotal role it plays in enforcing content policies, particularly safeguarding minors.

**Crimestoppers International (CSI)**

In January 2024 we [announced our working relationship](https://www.aylo.com/newsroom/Crime-Stoppers-Working-Relationship/) with Crime Stoppers International with a shared goal to enhance the cooperation and collaboration between the online adult industry, civil society and law enforcement in combatting online harms and exploitation.

For a full list of Trust and Safety partnerships, initiatives and external technology, please refer to our [Trust and Safety Initiatives](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/19159382668435-Trust-and-Safety-Initiatives) page.

**Image-based Sexual Abuse Principles**

After the White House issued a [Call to Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/gpc/briefing-room/2024/05/23/a-call-to-action-to-combat-image-based-sexual-abuse/) to Combat Image-Based Sexual Abuse for tech and civil society on May 23, 2024, the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), and the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) invited civil society organizations and tech industry leaders to a multistakeholder working group (“[Working Group](https://cdt.org/press/cdt-ccri-and-nnedv-announce-multistakeholder-working-group-to-address-non-consensual-intimate-images/)”) focused on combating IBSA.

Aylo participated in this working group, which worked to create a set of [principles](https://ibsaprinciples.org/), which were published in September 2024. We are proud of our continued work to prevent non-consensual content and hope that more organisations will sign-up to these voluntary principles.

**Identity Verification**

**Yoti – Third-Party Identity Documentation Validation**

Only verified content creators may upload content to Pornhub. 

Users who apply to the Model Program submit their identity documents for verification through a trusted third-party documentation validation and identity verification service provider. Members of the Model Program are also required to obtain, retain and provide identification and evidence of consent to record and distribute for every performer appearing in their content. 

Yoti is our primary third-party identification verification provider. Yoti is trusted by governments and regulators around the world, as well as a wide range of commercial industries. Yoti deploys a combination of state-of-the-art AI technology, liveness anti-spoofing, and document authenticity checks to thoroughly verify the age and identity of any user. Yoti technology can handle millions of scans per day with over 240 million age scans performed in 2019. Yoti has received certification from the British Board of Film Classification’s age verification program and from the Age Check Certification Scheme, a United Kingdom Accreditation Service.

Users who verify their identity with Yoti can trust that their personal data remains secure. Yoti is certified to meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001, which is the global gold standard for information security management. This means that Yoti’s security aligns with Pornhub’s commitment to protecting our users’ privacy as well. You can learn more about how Yoti works [here](https://www.yoti.com/).

**Incode – Third-Party Identity Documentation Validation**

In the second half of 2024, we have conducted testing with an additional IDV provider, Incode. The use of Incode's service is expected to be deployed during the first half of 2025.

**Deterrence Messaging**

**Lucy Faithfull Foundation & Deterrence Messaging**

The [Lucy Faithfull Foundation](https://www.lucyfaithfull.org.uk/) is a widely respected non-profit organization at the forefront of the fight against child sex abuse, whose crucial efforts include a campaign designed to deter searches seeking or associated with underage content. We have actively worked with Lucy Faithfull to develop deterrence messaging for terms relating to child sexual abuse material (CSAM). As a result, attempts to search for certain words and terms now yield a clear deterrence message about the illegality of underage content, while offering a free, confidential, and anonymous support resource for those interested in seeking help for controlling their urges to engage in illegal behavior. In 2022, we partnered with further organizations who offer local resources to change user behavior, including those in Canada, the Czech Republic, and Australia. This takes our total to eleven localized versions and one global CSAM deterrence message. In the first half of 2023, we added additional messaging in Germany via [Charite](https://www.charite.de/), Switzerland via [Beforemore](https://beforemore.ch/) and [Disno](https://www.disno.ch/), and Spanish speaking countries via [Protect Children](https://www.suojellaanlapsia.fi/en). 

**Deterrence Messaging for Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery**

Since the launch of our CSAM deterrence messaging, we have embarked on a similar initiative for non-consensual material. This concerns searches for content where there is a lack of consent to sexual acts, the recording or distribution of the content, or manipulation of one’s image, commonly known as “deepfakes”. If users search for terms relating to non-consensual material, they are reminded that such material may be illegal. As part of the messaging, resources are provided for removal of non-consensual material and support for victims via our NGO partners. In 2022 we added [Permesso Negato](https://www.permessonegato.it/), an NGO based in Italy, providing support to victims across the EU, along with [StopChikane](https://stopchikane.nu/), an NGO based in Denmark.

**Trusted Flagger Program**

Launched in 2020, our Trusted Flagger Program is now comprised of 55 members spanning over 35 countries, including the [Internet Watch Foundation](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) (UK), the [Cyber Civil Rights Initiative](https://cybercivilrights.org/) (USA), [End Child Prostitution and Trafficking](https://ecpat.org/) (Sweden/Taiwan), and [Point de Contact](https://www.pointdecontact.net/) (France). This program allows hotlines, helplines, government agencies, and other trusted organizations to disable content automatically and instantly from Pornhub, without awaiting our internal review. It is a significant step forward in identifying, removing, and reporting harmful and illegal content. In 2023 we added PermessoNegato (Italy), The RATI Foundation (India), The Centre for Exploited and Missing Children (Serbia), Cultivando Genero AC (Mexico), StopChikane (Denmark), and the Taipei Women’s Rescue Foundation (Taiwan).

Child Sexual Abuse Material Policy
==================================

**November 2025**

_**We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards any material that sexualizes, sexually exploits, or endangers**_ _**children on our platform, and we actively work to detect and remove such material. If we find or are made aware of it, we will report it.**_

Pornhub is deeply committed to fighting the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). This includes media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. We view it as our responsibility to work to ensure our platform is not used for sharing or consuming CSAM, and to deter users from searching for it.

Any content featuring or depicting a child (real, fictional, or animated) or promoting child sexual exploitation is strictly forbidden on our platform and is a severe violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms#terms). Written content (including, but not limited to, comments, content titles, content descriptions, messages, usernames, or profile descriptions) that promotes, references, or alludes to the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child is also strictly prohibited.

For the purposes of this policy, a child is any person under eighteen (18) years of age. We report all cases of apparent CSAM to the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](https://www.missingkids.org/) (NCMEC), a nonprofit organization which operates a centralized clearinghouse for reporting incidents of online sexual exploitation of children. NCMEC makes reports available to appropriate law enforcement agencies globally.

Additionally, at Pornhub we endorse and stand behind the objectives of the [Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1256061/download) a collaborative initiative launched by the Five Country Ministerial (5 Eyes)[\[1\]](#_ftn1) and backed by industry-leading tech companies to combat online child sexual exploitation and abuse. While some bad actors seek to exploit advances in technology and the digital world, we believe robust, efficient, and flexible policies, as well as participating in and supporting global cross-sector collaboration, can effectively eradicate the spread of online abuse.    

If you encounter child sexual abuse material on Pornhub, please report it to us via our [Content Removal Request Form](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal).  For information on how to report Child Sexual Abuse Material please refer to the Additional Resources and Support section below. 

**Anyone can report potential violations of this policy.**

For more information on how to report content, see the section titled “How Can You Help Us”.

All complaints and reports to Pornhub are kept confidential and are reviewed by human moderators who work swiftly to handle the content appropriately. **If you believe a child is in imminent danger, please also alert your local law enforcement authorities immediately**.  

[\[1\]](#_ftnref1) The Five Country Ministerial is made up of the Homeland Security, Public Safety and Immigration Ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, who gather annually to collaborate on meeting common security challenges.

  If you encounter child sexual abuse material on our platform, please [**report it to us**](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal).

**Guideline**

**DO NOT** post material (whether visual, audio or written content) that\*:

*   Features, involves, or depicts a child.
*   Sexualizes a child. This includes content that features, involves, or depicts a child (including any illustrated, computer-generated, or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child) engaged in sexually explicit conduct or engaged in sexually suggestive acts.

\* This serves as an indicative list and does not constitute an exhaustive list. For a more detailed description, please review our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms#terms), under the section entitled, “Prohibited Uses”. Pornhub reserves the right at all times to determine whether content is appropriate and in compliance with our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms#terms), and may, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove content at any time.

**Enforcement**

We have strict policies, operational mechanisms, and technologies in place to tackle and take swift action against CSAM. We also cooperate with law enforcement investigations and promptly respond to valid legal requests received to assist in combating the dissemination of CSAM on our platform.

Our team of human moderators work around the clock to review all content uploaded to help prevent any content which may be in violation of our CSAM or other policies, from appearing on our platform. Additionally, when we are alerted to an actual or potential instance of CSAM appearing on the platform, we remove and investigate the content and report any material identified as CSAM to NCMEC. As part of our ongoing efforts, we regularly audit our websites to update and expand our list of banned search words, titles, and tags, helping to ensure our community remains safe, inclusive, diverse, and free from abusive and illegal content.

In conjunction with our team of human moderators and regular audits of our platform, we also rely on innovative industry-standard technical tools to assist in identifying, reporting, and removing CSAM and other types of illegal content from our platform. We use automated detection technologies as added layers of protection to better guard against CSAM on our platform.

These technologies include:

*   [**Youtube’s CSAI Match**](https://www.youtube.com/csai-match/), a tool that assists in identifying known child sex abuse videos.
*   [**Microsoft’s PhotoDNA**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna), a tool that aids in detecting and removing known images of child sexual abuse.
*   [**Google's Content Safety API**](https://protectingchildren.google/intl/en/#introduction), a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tool that scores and prioritizes content based on the likelihood of illegal imagery to assist reviewers in detecting unknown CSAM.
*   [**Safer**](https://safer.io/ "https://safer.io/"), Thorn's comprehensive CSAM detection tool utilized to keep platforms free of abusive material.
*   **Instant Image Identifier**, the Centre for Expertise on Online Sexual Child Abuse ([Offlimits](https://offlimits.nl/)) tool, commissioned by the European Commission, detects known child abuse imagery using a triple verified database.
*   [**NCMEC**](https://www.missingkids.org/) **Hash Sharing:** NCMEC’s database of known CSAM hashes, including hashes submitted by individuals who fingerprinted their own underage content via NCMEC’s [Take It Down](https://takeitdown.ncmec.org/) service. 
*   [**Internet Watch Foundation**](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) **(IWF) Hash List:** IWF’s database of known CSAM, sourced from hotline reports and the UK Home Office’s Child Abuse Image Database.
*   **MediaWise**® service from [Vobile](https://www.vobilegroup.com/) ®, a state-of-the-art fingerprinting software and database, which scans all new user uploads to help prevent previously identified offending content from being re-uploaded.
*   **Safeguard:** Our proprietary image fingerprinting and recognition technology designed with the purpose of combatting both child sexual abuse imagery and the distribution of non-consensual intimate images, and to help prevent the re-uploading of that content to our platform.
*   **Age Estimation:** We also utilize age estimation capabilities to analyze content uploaded to our platform using a combination of internal proprietary software and external technology in an effort to strengthen the varying methods we use to prevent the upload and publication of potential or actual CSAM.
*   **Transcription Service:** Our transcription service transcribes the audio in uploaded videos to text. Transcribed text is then run against our list of banned words to assist our moderation team in identifying content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines). 
    
*   **Watermark Detection Service**: We utilize internal proprietary technology to detect watermarks identified in violative content to assist in identifying and removing new or related uploads of this content.
    

Together, these tools play a fundamental role in our shared fight against the dissemination of CSAM on our platform, as well as our mission to assist in collective industry efforts to eradicate the horrendous global crime that is online child sexual exploitation and abuse.

**How Can You Help Us**

If you believe you have come across CSAM, or any other content that otherwise violates our Terms of Service, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the content by [flagging](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055147653-Report-Harmful-Content) it for our review or by submitting a request through our [Content Removal Request Form](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal).

When submitting a Content Removal Request, please include all relevant URL links to the content in question and we will address your request confidentially and remove the content expeditiously.

Anyone can report violations of this policy using our [Content Removal Request Form](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal), whether they have an account on our platform or not.

**Consequences for violating this policy**

We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards any content that involves a child or constitutes child sexual abuse material, and we actively work to detect and remove such material. All child sexual abuse material that we identify or are made aware of results in the immediate removal of the content in question and the banning of its uploader. We report all cases of apparent CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

**Additional Resources and Support**

**If you believe a child is in imminent danger, you should reach out to your local law enforcement agency to report the situation immediately**.

You may also choose to reach out to and report cases of child sexual exploitation or abuse material to any of the following resource organizations dedicated to eliminating and preventing child sexual exploitation. Reports can be made anonymously and are an integral part in protecting the safety of children.

Non-Consensual Content Policy
=============================

**December 2025**

Consent, as a rule and [value](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041768014-Core-Values), is paramount to the security of our users and integrity of our platform.

We require all uploaders to affirm they have obtained and maintain valid consent and proper release documentation for all persons featured in all content uploaded to the platform. In addition, content must adhere to our [core values](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041768014-Core-Values), community guidelines, as well as our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms).

Content that we identify as a violation of our Non-Consensual Content Policy will be removed, and the associated user’s account actioned accordingly.

**What is considered a violation of our non-consensual content policy:**

The recording or distribution of intimate images (that is, photos and videos that are generally understood to depict explicit sexual activity or nudity or partial nudity) without someone’s consent is a violation of that person’s privacy and is a severe violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), and is **strictly prohibited**. Content featuring or promoting non-consensual acts, real or simulated, is also prohibited.

**Guidelines** 

**Do NOT** use the platform to upload, post, or otherwise share explicit images or videos that were taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of the people involved. Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not limited to**\***:

*   Videos or photos of any person, whether in a public or private setting, without that person’s valid written consent (such as hidden/spy camera content, or up-skirt content);
    
*   Sharing explicit sexual images of someone else without their valid written consent (this would include, namely: non-consensual distribution of intimate images, also commonly referred to as “revenge porn”);
    
*   Sharing non-sexually explicit images of someone else without their valid written consent;
    
*   “Doxing”, defined as exposing private and identifying information about a particular individual, including phone number, e-mail, address, or full name.
    

To help protect the integrity of the platform, we also **prohibit** content, including fictional, simulated, or animated, that features or depicts\*:

*   Depictions of non-consensual sexual activity\*, including coerced or forced sexual acts, rape, or sexual assault;
*   Persons appearing drugged, incapacitated, or intoxicated\*\* involved in sexual acts;
*   Any “deepfakes” whatsoever (AI-generated, modified, or other manipulations of a person’s image, whether in picture or video, to deceive or mislead the viewer into believing that person is acting or speaking in the way presented).

\* See our section below on _Sensitive Themes and Considerations for Consent_.

\*\* Intoxicated (including pretending to be) means a state induced by alcohol or drugs, whether legal, illicit, or recreational as determined by Pornhub in its sole discretion, such that a performer’s judgment appears to the reasonable observer as objectively impaired.

**Sensitive Themes and Consideration for Consent** 

It is important to remember that pornography does not always represent sexual interactions and behaviors typical of everyday life, and often depicts diverse fantasies and role-play scenarios by consenting amateurs and professionals. In all cases, whether professional or amateur, we expect content to adhere to Pornhub's [core values](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041768014-Core-Values) and [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms).

When reviewing content depicting the sensitive themes listed below, we take the following into consideration to determine whether it violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms). We recommend reviewing our detailed policy before uploading content involving these sensitive themes. Consent must be determinable by the reasonable observer from the material itself, which may be assessed either through clear verbal or visual cues.

Note that we consider many factors to distinguish fantasy from reality. The following is a non-exhaustive list of what we consider sensitive themes. Accordingly, content engaging with the following themes is subject to removal, and appropriate account enforcement, where found to be in violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms):

*   **Spells, Mesmerizing, or Possession**: We do not permit content where:
    *   A performer is depicted as incapacitated, or otherwise completely unconscious because of possession, spells, or mesmerizing;
    *   Performers display signs of distress or panic during or after the act; or
    *   Realistic depictions of spellbound, mesmerized, or possessed performers engaged in or subjected to sexual acts.
*   **Sleep**: Where there is a component of sleep in the content, the person must wake up within a reasonable time from the start of any sexual act(s) and consent must be made clear by that person.
*   **Bondage and Restraints**: If a scene features the use of a gag, restraint(s), or other device(s) that would render a performer unable to clearly speak or move, consent to continued participation must be clearly determinable from the material itself, or where it cannot be, consent must be clearly determinable through other visual or verbal cues.
*   **Sub-Dom Fantasies**: Consent must be determinable from the material itself, through clear verbal or visual cues.

To be clear, our rules with respect to these sensitive themes are not a judgment on these forms of sexual expression but aim to make clear what is or is not acceptable on our platform, to maintain a safe community.

**Enforcement** 

We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting the safety of our users. As a content sharing platform, Pornhub relies on technology, our team of human moderators, and our wider community of users to help identify violative content. We also actively cooperate with law-enforcement investigations and promptly respond to valid legal requests received in order to assist in combating the dissemination of non-consensual recordings and distribution on the Pornhub platform.

  **24/7 Human Moderation Team**

Our team of moderators and support staff work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to review all uploaded content for violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), address user concerns, and remove all non-consensual content that we identify or of which we are made aware.

  **Community Oversight and Detection**

Detecting non-consensual images at the time of upload is complex. While we use technology to combat the distribution of non-consensual intimate images and videos, we also rely on people proactively reporting that type of content to us. As such, members of our community play an important role in helping to secure the integrity and safety of our platform.

If you have first-hand knowledge of content on the platform that violates these guidelines, or is otherwise illegal and abusive, you may alert us by filling out and submitting our [Content Removal Request Form](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal) as soon as possible so that we can take appropriate and swift action.

If you are a registered user, if you come across content, users, or comments that you think may be harmful for the community, you may also [flag](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055147653-Report-Harmful-Content) them to us for review. 

  **Automated Tools**

In conjunction with our team of human moderators and regular audits of our platform, we also rely on innovative industry-standard technical tools to assist in identifying, reporting, and removing illegal and abusive content from our platform.

These technologies include:

*   [**StopNCII.org**](https://stopncii.org/): A global initiative (developed by Meta & SWGfL) that prevents the spread of non-consensual intimate images (NCII) online. If any adult (18+) is concerned about their intimate images (or videos) being shared online without consent, they can create a digital fingerprint of their own material and prevent it from being shared across participating platforms. 
*   **MediaWise®** service from [Vobile](https://www.vobilegroup.com/)®, a state-of-the-art fingerprinting software and database, which scans all new user uploads to help prevent previously identified offending content from being re-uploaded.
*   **Safeguard:** Our proprietary image fingerprinting and recognition technology designed with the purpose of combatting both child sexual abuse imagery and the distribution of non-consensual intimate images, and to help prevent the re-uploading of that content to our platform.
*   **Watermark Detection Service**: We utilize internal proprietary technology to detect watermarks identified in violative content to assist in identifying and removing new or related uploads of this content.
    
*   **Transcription Service**: Our transcription service transcribes the audio in uploaded videos to text. Transcribed text is then run against our list of banned words to assist our moderation team in identifying content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419900587155-Community-Guidelines). 
    

We encourage users who have content in which they are featured, and who wish to prevent the upload of such content to our platform, to consider proactively digitally fingerprinting it.

If you are interested in having your content digitally fingerprinted by Vobile you may contact them directly via [https://vobile.com/about/contact/](https://vobile.com/about/contact/). 

  Should you wish to remove content that you: appear in and did not consent to have made and/or shared; OR content that is illegal and/or otherwise violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), please [**report it to us**](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal).

**Consequences for Violating this Policy** 

In all cases where we identify or are made aware of content that violates this policy, our Trust & Safety and Moderation teams work swiftly to:

*   Review and remove infringing content;
*   Fingerprint the content in question to help block future uploads of the same content to our sites; AND
*   Suspend or permanently terminate the associated uploader's account, where appropriate. 

**How Can You Help Us?** 

If you believe you have come across non-consensual content, or any other content that otherwise violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), we strongly encourage you to immediately alert us by [flagging](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055147653-Report-Harmful-Content) the content for our review.

If you are the victim or have first-hand knowledge that content violates our Non-Consensual Content policy, please report the content to us by completing and submitting our [**CONTENT REMOVAL REQUEST FORM**](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal). Please include all relevant URL links to the content in question and we will address your request confidentially and remove the content expeditiously.

Animal Welfare Policy
=====================

**July 2022**

Pornhub is a content-hosting and sharing platform for consenting adult use and entertainment only. At Pornhub, we denounce the involvement in any way of animals in any abusive and/or sexual context.

That is why all forms of animal\* abuse and cruelty, whether physical or psychological is prohibited. More specifically, we don’t allow any visual or written content involving animal abuse, including “crushing.” We also prohibit content that involves or advocates for the sexual exploitation of animals, including as the object of sexual interest, and/or contact with an animal for a sexual purpose, including “bestiality.”

Refer to our guideline below for some practical examples of **what we do NOT allow** on Pornhub.

\* For the purposes of the present guideline, 'animal' is considered to be any actual, true, or realistic representation or depiction (including animated) non-human animal.

**Guidelines** 

The following guidelines apply to audio, written, and visual, as well as actual, simulated, and animated content 

**Do NOT post any content (including animated) that** features, depicts, advocates for, or promotes**:**

*   Any sexual act or contact in sexual context, between a human and an animal, whether visual, verbal, or written.
*   Placement of animals by humans within cruel or unusual confinement, regardless of the presence of humans.
*   The depiction or appearance of emotional distress caused to an animal by a human.
*   Forcing animals into an act (violent or sexual) with a human or other animal.
*   Sexual arousal by, from, or with animals, whether visual, verbal, or written. 
*   Sexual activity while in proximity of an animal where the animal appears to be the primary focus and/or the object of arousal for the individual(s).
*   Subjecting animals to any type of bodily harm.
*   Animal and insect crushing.

**Enforcement**

We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting the safety of our users. As a user-generated content hosting platform, Pornhub relies on technology, our team of human moderators, and our wider community of users to help identify violative content.

  **24/7 Human Moderation Team**

Our team of moderators and support staff work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to review all uploaded content for violations of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms), and address user concerns, and remove all content that we identify or which we are made aware of and deem as violating our policies and/or [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms). 

  **Community Oversight and Detection**

If you come across content, users, or comments that you think may violate this policy or otherwise be harmful for the community, you may [flag](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055147653-Report-Harmful-Content) this content to us for review. 

  **Automated Tools**

Content that is identified and removed for violating our Animal Welfare policy may be digitally fingerprinted using both the MediaWise® service from Vobile® and Safeguard, our own proprietary digital fingerprinting software. Digitally fingerprinting unauthorized content serves as an added layer of protection against further distribution of the content on our platform.

**Consequences for Violating this Policy** 

In all cases where we identify or are made aware of content that may violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) and Community Guidelines, our dedicated team works swiftly to review and remove any violative content.

Depending on the findings, our team may also:

*   Utilize sophisticated industry-standard tools to fingerprint the content in question in order to block potential future uploads of the same content to our sites; AND
*   Suspend or permanently terminate the associated user’s account, where appropriate.

**How Can You Help Us?**

If you believe you have come across content that may otherwise violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information/terms) reach out to us at [support@pornhub.com](mailto:support@pornhub.com) or, if you’re signed into your Pornhub account, you can alert us by [**flagging**](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419875025043) the content for our review.

Violent Content Policy
======================

Any content that depicts activity or behavior posing a real threat or likelihood of causing serious physical injury or death to the person(s) featured is strictly prohibited on our platform and constitutes a serious violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms).

It is important to remember that pornography does not always represent sexual interactions and behaviors typical of everyday life, and often depicts diverse fantasies and role-play scenarios by consenting amateurs and professionals. Valid consent and intent are integral for all images and videos uploaded to the site, and therefore context plays a critical role in evaluating whether extreme fantasies violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms) or pose a real threat or likelihood of causing serious distress or physical injury to the individuals involved.

Pornhub aims to offer the adult community an open, safe, and diverse space for an array of sexual expression and preferences. Consent and context are key to distinguishing content that depicts prohibited content, such as extreme violence posing a serious risk of harm or death, from exploring pain, kinks and/or less traditional sexual-based activities. Content that is categorized as BDSM, hardcore, or rough may often contain graphic content and/or violence. Although we recognize that some may consider BDSM, Hardcore, or Rough sex as “degrading” or “dehumanizing,” these words are entirely subjective. Essentially, what is degrading and dehumanizing to you may be empowering and dignifying for someone practicing safe BDSM. To learn more about [**healthy BDSM**](https://www.thehotline.org/2017/04/06/healthy-bdsm-relationships-possible/), we invite users to check out our **additional resources** section below.

That being said, we wish to highlight that although fetishes such as BDSM, Hardcore, and Rough Sex are popular categories, the vast majority of this style of content is created and produced by professionals in a safe and secure environment, employing strict [consent](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419871944723) and safety-based protocols, and involving consenting adults. In all cases, be it professional or amateur, we expect all user content to adhere to the Pornhub's [**Core Values**](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419871944723). 

Our [**Sexual Wellness Center**](https://www.pornhub.com/sex/) offers advice from a variety of health care practitioners, sex therapists, and industry experts. To learn more about [**Pornhub’s** **commitment to promoting sexual wellness**](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419883155347)  visit our [**Sexual Wellness Center**](https://www.pornhub.com/sex/). If you are seeking advice on your current sexual activities or are looking to try something new, it is important to do your research and educate yourself on safe practice. _Consider checking out and/or contacting one of the resources listed below in our **additional resources** section._ 

**Guidelines**

**Do NOT post any content that\*:**

*   Features non-consensual activity
*   Depicts activity or behaviour posing a real threat or likelihood of causing serious physical injury or death to the person(s) featured
*   Features animal crushing (one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury)
*   Features blood resulting from inflicted bodily harm

We reiterate that [consent](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419871944723) is integral for all content uploaded to the platform, and context is a key component when evaluating graphic and/or content that contains violence. Consent and intent play a critical role in evaluating context and whether or not the extent of violence depicted in content is prohibited.

\*This serves as an indicative list and does not constitute an exhaustive list. For the full description, please review our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), under the section entitled, Prohibited Uses. Pornhub reserves the right at all times to determine whether content is appropriate and in compliance with our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), and may remove any content at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, if such content is found to be in violation of our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms) or is otherwise objectionable.

**Enforcement**

Context and intent are integral aspects of our moderation protocols when it comes to identifying the aforementioned types of content. Pornhub relies on a dedicated team of human moderators that work around the clock to review and remove all content that violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), including content that depicts extreme violence posing a serious risk to the lives of individuals involved. Amongst a range of cues and criteria, our compliance team monitors for language, intent and context in order to distinguish content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety.

  If you come across content on our platform that violates this policy, or content that otherwise violate our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), please **[report](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal)** [it to us by completing and submitting our **Content Removal Request Form**](https://www.pornhub.com/content-removal). Once submitted and reviewed by one of our moderators, the content in question will be removed, where appropriate, expeditiously.

**Consequences for Violating this Policy**

We will immediately remove any content found to violate the present policy. Where appropriate, the user’s associated account may also be permanently terminated.

**Additional Resources and Support**

**If you believe anyone is in imminent danger, you should reach out to your local law enforcement agency to report the situation immediately.**

Parental Controls
=================

The Pornhub platform is intended to be a secure and sex-positive space for adult viewing and adult content **only.** We take seriously our commitment to the safety of our users and integrity of our platform.

**Pornhub is fully RTA compliant as rated by the Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP), and, as a reminder, is strictly reserved for those of legal age only**.

As is clearly outlined in our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), access to our platform is strictly limited to those who affirm that :

*   They are at least eighteen (18) years of age (or older in any other location in which 18 is not the minimum age of majority) from which our platform is accessed.
*   Are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in our [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms), and to abide by and comply with said [Terms of Service](https://www.pornhub.com/information#terms) .
*   The jurisdiction from which they access our platform does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.

In order to help enforce our terms and assist in restricting access to minors, we have ensured that Pornhub is, and remains, fully [RTA \[Restricted to Adults\]](https://www.rtalabel.org/) compliant, and allows every page to be blocked by simple parental control tools.

We urge parents to monitor their children’s online activity and implement parental controls as appropriate to keep their children safe in the digital age. We firmly believe that parents are best placed to police their children’s activity using the plethora of tools already available in modern operating systems and devices.

We have set out below some simple guidelines and advice on how to limit the potential for your child to access inappropriate content .

####   Making the Internet Child-Friendly

There are many tools available for parents to make the internet safer for their children. ISPs, device manufacturers, and operating system developers have ensured an easy route to setting up parental controls. They all use simple step-by-step instructions which you only need to follow once, giving you control over your children’s browsing habits beyond simple supervision.

Pornhub’s Restricted to Adults tags ensure that all such controls can automatically block our site when enabled by parents.

**Parental Control Settings - Desktop Services**

All modern operating systems have built-in parental controls and they are simple to activate requiring only a few minutes to setup. Microsoft Windows 10 for instance, allows parents to easily setup accounts for their children, restrict which apps and programs they can open, and block inappropriate websites at the touch of a button.

Visit the [_Microsoft Family Safety_](https://family.microsoft.com/) site for more information.

Apple devices such as Macs, iPads, and iPhones have similar parental controls which can be enabled by following the instructions on Apple’s dedicated [_Families site_](https://www.apple.com/families/). 

**Parental Control Settings - Mobile Devices**

As many children use their own personal devices to access the internet, mobile operating systems now include tools to ensure parents can stay firmly in control of their children’s browsing habits.

iOS devices from Apple such as iPhones and iPads can block inappropriate content, set screen time limits and prevent apps from being installed without permission. More information is available on Apple’s dedicated _[Families site](https://www.apple.com/families/)._

Android products such as smartphones and tablets contain similar protections, allowing parents to choose what their children can see and do on their personal devices. The [_Google Safety Centre_](https://safety.google/families/) will walk you through the setup process.

**Internet Service Providers**

Most, if not all Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer protections to limit the websites available to your home or handheld device. Such services block all traffic to inappropriate websites and can usually be enabled by logging into your ISP account online. Simply contact your ISP and they can advise how to enable their content blocks.

**Dedicated Parental Control Software**

In addition to parental controls provided free of charge by operating systems, device manufacturers and ISPs, there are multiple parental control apps available from third parties. A non-exhaustive list is provided below:

*   [Qustodio](https://www.qustodio.com/)
*   [Kaspersky Safe Kids](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/safe-kids)
*   [Net Nanny](https://www.netnanny.com/)
*   [Norton Family](https://family.norton.com/)
*   [Mobicip](https://www.mobicip.com/)

**More Information on Digital Parenting and Supervision**

If you want to find out more information on protecting your children online, how to talk to them, and how to set and agree limits, there are several resources available.
