This section explains how we use cookies and similar technologies (we refer to them collectively as "**cookies**") to recognize you when you visit our Platform. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control them.

**What are cookies****？**

A cookie is a string of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's or mobile device's hard drive. If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same browser or device to access the Platform, our web servers will be notified of your visit to the Platform and, in turn, we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage.

Cookies set by the site or app owner (in this case, AliExpress) are called "**first party Cookies**". Cookies set by third parties other than the site or app owner are called "**third party Cookies**". Third party Cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

Cookies are also categorized as "**session Cookies**" (which are erased once you close the browser or shut down the device) and "**persistent Cookies"** (which remain even after closing the browser or shutting down the device/application and which are activated each time you visit the Platform). Session cookies use encrypted data to authenticate you. Persistent Cookies do not store account numbers or passwords. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.

**Why do we use cookies?**

We use first- and third-party Cookies for several reasons.

Some cookies are required for technical and/or security reasons in order for our Platform to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. First party Cookies are mainly served to enable basic functionality on our Platform; including web analytics cookies that help us understand how users use our web pages and how we can improve their use. For example, we use essential or strictly necessary cookies to enable us to remember goods added to your shopping basket and to recognize you when you sign into your account.

We also use social media cookies. You may register for Platform membership and “share” Platform content through social media such as Facebook and X. Sometimes we embed videos from websites like YouTube. These websites have their own privacy policies which govern their use of information, which you can find on the respective websites.

We also use cookies to enable us to track and target the interests of Platform visitors to enhance the experience on our Platform by researching visiting patterns and conducting interest-based advertising; assisting our partners in tracking user visits to the Platforms; and to track progress and participation in promotions and the success of our email marketing campaigns. We use first- and third-party Cookies for these purposes.

For more information about the cookies we use, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://terms.alicdn.com/legal-agreement/terms/c_platform_service_agreement/20240401172006520/20240401172006520.html).

If you share a computer with others, you should not save your log-in information (e.g., user ID and password) on that shared computer. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session.

No data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.

**I.** **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.

 You have the following rights concerning your personal data, subject to certain limitations and exceptions under applicable law:

*   Access: You have the right to request to confirm whether we are processing personal data about you, and to access such personal data. If you are a resident of Oregon, you may receive additional information regarding certain disclosures we make to third parties, which we will provide our response to your access request.

You have the right to opt out of the processing of personal data for personalized advertising purposes at any time by changing your cookies choices via our [Cookie Preferences](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/cookie-setting/index.html) on our Platform or by visiting our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.aliexpress.com/) and opting out via the Advertising Preferences setting.

**California residents**

This section supplements the description of our information collection and sharing practices described above under Section A. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION and provides certain disclosures to California residents whose personal information we process pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("**CCPA**").

**Collection of Personal Information**. During the preceding 12 months, we have collected, used, and/or disclosed the categories of personal information described above in Section A. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.

The personal information that we collect, or have collected in the preceding 12 months, falls into the following categories of personal information, as enumerated by the CCPA:

·       Identifiers, such as your name, postal address, email address, user account name, and IP address;

·       Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)), such as your contact information;

·       Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase history;

·       Internet or network activity information, such as your browsing history and interactions with our Platform;

·       Geolocation data, such as your approximate location;

·       Audio, electronic, visual, and similar information, such as your records of your support requests and interactions with our customer support service; and

·       Inferences drawn from any of the above personal information to create a summary about you, for example of your preferences and characteristics.

In limited circumstances, we may also collect sensitive personal information as defined in the CCPA, such as account log-in information.

We may obtain the categories of personal information listed above from the categories of sources described above in Section A. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION above.

**Use of Personal Information**. The business purposes for which we collect and handle personal information is described above in Section B. USE OF PERSONAL DATA above.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**. We disclose or share personal information in the ways described above in Section C. DISCLOSURE OR SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA above, including by allowing third parties that provide us analytics and advertising services to collect information through cookies and other similar technologies. 

The CCPA defines a "sale" as disclosing or making available personal information to a third party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and "sharing" includes disclosing or making available personal information to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, like many websites, we may "share" (as defined in the CCPA) certain identifiers (i.e., IP address and online identifiers), usage data, and inferences to advertising networks, data analytics providers, operating systems and platforms, and social networks, including in the context of our use of certain cookies, pixel tags, and other similar tools and technologies. We do so in order to improve and evaluate our advertising campaigns and better reach customers and prospective customers with more relevant ads and content.

The types of personal information that we may share include unique identifiers (e.g., cookies and similar technologies), device information, geolocation data, commercial data, behavioral data, and inferences. 

To the extent that the use of cookies and other tracking technologies to disclose certain personal information to third parties to display targeted or personalized advertisements to you constitutes a "sale" or "sharing" of personal information under the CCPA, you may opt out of such cookies at any time by adjusting your cookie choices in our [Cookie Preferences](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/cookie-setting/index.html) on our Platform to adjust your cookie choices.

We do not "sell" or "share" sensitive personal information, nor do we "sell" or "share" any personal information about individuals who we know are under sixteen (16) years old.

You can opt out of any future sale of personal information by using the contact details provided under “Making US Privacy Rights Requests” below in this section or Section P. HOW TO CONTACT US below.

**California Privacy Rights**. If you are a resident of California, you have the following rights under the CCPA, subject to certain limitations and exceptions under applicable law:

·       **Know and Access****:** You have the right to request to know and access the following information covering the 12 months preceding your request:

\- the categories of sources from which your personal information was collected;  
\- the business or commercial purposes for collecting, "selling" and/or "sharing" your personal information;  
\- the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed, "sold" or "shared" personal information about you; and  
\- the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

You have the right to receive your personal information in a portable and commonly used format.

·       **Correct****:** You have the right to request that we correct any of your personal information that we have collected from you that is inaccurate.

·       **Delete****:** You may have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.

·      **Opt-out of the selling or sharing of your personal information****:** You have the right to request that a business not "sell" or "share" your personal information with a third party, as those terms are defined under the CCPA. As described above, we use cookies and other tracking technologies to make available certain personal information to third parties to display targeted or personalized advertisements to you. To the extent that such practice may constitute a "selling" or "sharing" of personal information under the CCPA, you may opt-out of such "selling" or "sharing" at any time by using our [Cookie Preferences](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/cookie-setting/index.html) on our Platform to adjust your cookie choices.

·      **Limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information**: We do not use or disclose "sensitive personal information" (as defined by the CCPA) for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or in any way that would require a right to limit under the CCPA. As a result, we do not offer an ability to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information.

·      **Non-Discrimination****:** You have the right not to be discriminated against because you exercise your rights under the CCPA. We shall not discriminate against you for exercising any of your above rights, for example, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services to you for exercising your CCPA rights unless those differences are related to your information or otherwise permitted by law.

**California Shine the Light Law**. Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our customer's personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, without their approval.

Certain employees of AliExpress, located outside your country of residence, are given limited remote access to this information so they can provide certain functions, as described in Section B. USE OF PERSONAL DATA. This access is limited, secure and only granted where necessary under strict security controls and authorization approval protocols.

  

We disclose or share personal information with Sellers, other buyers, service providers, partners and other third-party entities, as described in Section C. DISCLOSURE OR SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. These third parties can be located outside your country of residence.

        These entities commit to processing information in compliance with applicable privacy laws and to implementing appropriate security measures to protect your information.

        When we transfer your information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

•   Adequacy decisions. These are decisions from the European Commission 7 under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognize that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in Section A. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed above; or

•   Article 49. In the absence of an adequacy decision, we rely on Article 49 (1)(b) and (c) GDPR to transfer Purchase Information as described in Section A. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION to sellers and transaction fulfilment providers in countries without an adequacy decision when necessary to provide shopping features to facilitate the purchase and delivery of products, goods and services, or to process your orders; or

•   Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalents for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. If Article 49 (1)(b) and (c) is not applicable, we rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in Section B. USE OF PERSONAL DATA to certain entities in Alibaba Group and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

  

For a copy of these adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses, please contact us via the details provided in Section P.HOW TO CONTACT US below.

In addition, we regularly assess the legal and regulatory frameworks of countries receiving the data to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of our transfer safeguards, particularly in cases where standard contractual clauses are used. These assessments help us determine whether supplementary measures are needed to ensure an essentially equivalent level of data protection as required by the GDPR.
