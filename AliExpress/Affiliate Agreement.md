Effective Date: 21 May 2024

Any person or entity that participates or attempts to participate in our influencer marketing program (the “Influencer Program” and such person or entity, “you”, or an “Influencer”) must accept this AliExpress Influencer Program Service Agreement (this “Agreement”) without change. By clicking the “Accept” button, you agree to this Agreement, including the Relevant Rules (defined in Section 16), which are incorporated by reference. Please read them carefully.

1.

Description of the Influencer Program

1.1.

The Influencer Program permits you to monetize your social media presence or social media user-generated content (referred to here as your “Influencer Account”) by advertising items sold or services offered on the website with the URL [https://www.aliexpress.com](https://www.aliexpress.com/)(the “AliExpress Site”) (the “Products”). In order to facilitate your advertisement of these Products, we may make available to you data, images, text, link formats, widgets, links, marketing content, and other linking tools, application program interfaces, and other information in connection with the Influencer Program (the “AliExpress Content”). AliExpress Content specifically excludes any data, images, text, or other information or content relating to product offering on any site other than the AliExpress Site.

1.2.

Upon enrollment in the Influencer Program, you can earn seeding balance, commission, bonus and other forms of rewards by participating in different campaigns and placing advertisements on your Influencer Account in accordance with our requirements and reward rules set forth in the AliExpress Influencer Program Policy (as amended from time to time) (the “Program Policy”) published on the Influencer Platform. You will not be able to redeem your seeding balance for cash. You can receive commission and/or bonuses (“Commission”) for Qualifying Purchases made by our customers via your advertisements of AliExpress Content in accordance with Section 7 of this Agreement and/or other qualifying actions (as may be determined in the Program Policy). Neither the seeding balance nor the Commission will be issued upon termination of the Influencer Program or if you are or become ineligible for the Influencer Program or do not place advertisement as required.

“Qualifying Purchases” means purchases completed by our customer on the AliExpress Site via Influencer’s advertisement of Products. A purchase shall only be deemed to be a “Qualifying Purchase” if the customer has taken the requisite steps required by the AliExpress Site for acknowledging completion of the transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, transactions on the AliExpress Site that are cancelled and/or refunded by a customer or involve Fraud shall not be deemed as a Qualifying Purchase.

“Fraud” means any action that intentionally attempts to create sales, leads, or click-throughs using robots, frames, iframes, scripts, or manually “refreshing” of pages, for the sole purpose of creating Commission.

1.3.

Subject to our prior approval, you may:

1.3.1.

propose other content displaying on the AliExpress Site to be advertised by you on your Influencer Account;

1.3.2.

create your own promotional content based on the AliExpress Content for advertisement on your Influencer Account; or

1.3.3.

transmit instruction or data to AliExpress for the latter to process and filter certain AliExpress Content.

2.

Registration and Compliance Requirements

2.1.

To register as an Influencer, you must complete all information requirements, including granting requests to access data regarding your social media presences. You acknowledge that if you fail to submit any of the required information or any of the submitted information is inaccurate or incomplete, AliExpress shall be entitled to suspend part or all functions for your account on the Influencer Platform.

2.2.

AliExpress reserves the right to reject your application for participation in the Influencer Program if AliExpress determines that, in its sole and absolute discretion, you are unsuitable for participation in the Influencer Program.

2.3.

You must comply with this Agreement to participate in the Influencer Program and receive Commission and other benefits.

2.4.

You must promptly provide us with any information that we request to verify your compliance with this Agreement.

2.5.

If you violate this Agreement, or if you violate terms and conditions of any other applicable rules and/or policies published by AliExpress from time to time (including but not limited to the AliExpress Affiliate Program Service Agreement and the AliExpress Affiliate Program Rules and Policies), then, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to us, we reserve the right to permanently (to the extent permitted by applicable law) cease payment of (and you agree you will not be eligible to receive) any and all Commission and rewards otherwise payable to you under this Agreement, whether or not directly related to such violation, without notice and without prejudice to any right of AliExpress to recover damages in excess of this amount. 

3.

Reporting and Tracking

3.1.

AliExpress will make available to you reports summarizing your performance in the Influencer Program and records relating to the Qualifying Purchases and/or other qualifying actions.

3.2.

You agree that all performance of your advertisement of AliExpress Content on your Influencer Account will be recorded and tracked by the tracking system and technology used by AliExpress. Unless otherwise agreed, the records tracked and stored by AliExpress’ tracking system shall serve as the sole basis for calculating the sum of Commission and other benefits payable to you under the Influencer Program.

3.3.

You shall not employ any method to directly or indirectly interfere, disrupt or disable AliExpress’ tracking system.

3.4.

AliExpress shall be entitled to invalidate the short-key which is embedded in the link generated using the tracking technology of AliExpress and which is used to record or track any clicks, purchases or actions, provided that (a) the short-key has been created for more than one year; (b) the short-key has been created for less than one year, but has no records of any clicks for the past six months; or (c) the link, in which the short-key is embedded, is known or suspicious to contain or direct to any part of any AliExpress Content or Third Party Content which would infringe or has infringed any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, or other proprietary right of any third party. For the avoidance of doubt, any tracking link with invalidated short-key will be invalid, including, without limitation, unable to track or record any clicks, purchases, or actions.

“Third Party Content” means text, artworks, graphics, logos, copies and/or other content which are provided and licensed by sellers on the AliExpress Site for Influencers to publish through the Influencer Account for attracting traffic and shall be thereafter made available on the Influencer Platform. For clarity, all content of Products (excluding any content prohibited by AliExpress, legal or regulatory authorities from time to time according to Relevant Rules, applicable laws or regulations) are Third Party Content.

AliExpress may refuse to arrange for such issuance, in its sole discretion, for any Influencer Content that is illegal, inappropriate, fraudulent or in violation of this Agreement or any Relevant Rules. AliExpress reserves the rights to invalidate any unique links, codes or APIs generated for you in relation to your participation in the Influencer Program.

Any statements contained in the Influencer Content should always reflect your honest and truthful opinions and actual experiences, and shall be in good taste and free of inappropriate language and/or any content that promotes bigotry, racism or discrimination against an individual based on race, gender, religion, nationality, disability sexual orientation or age.

AliExpress may (as determined by AliExpress in its sole discretion) but is not obligated to use Influencer Content. AliExpress reserves the right (in its sole discretion and at any time) to reject, remove, suspend, or restore any or all of the Influencer Content from the AliExpress Site. AliExpress has the right but not the obligation to monitor and request you to edit or remove any Influencer Content on your Influencer Account. AliExpress takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.

4.4.

WE WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY MATTER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATING TO THE CREATION, MAINTENANCE, OR OPERATION OF THE INFLUENCER ACCOUNT AND THE INFLUENCER CONTENT, AND YOU AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD US, OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS, AND OUR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND REPRESENTATIVES, HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) RELATING TO THE INFLUENCER ACCOUNT OR ANY INFLUENCER CONTENT.
