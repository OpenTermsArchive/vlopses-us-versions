【More information about Cookies】

What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to our Platform. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Platform or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Platform to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Platform from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

California Do Not Track Notice

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Cookie Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make and as required by applicable law, such as by posting an amended Cookie Policy on the Platform. We recommend that you review the Cookie Policy each time you visit our Service to stay informed of our privacy practices.
