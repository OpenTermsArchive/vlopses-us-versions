【About Cookies】

We use cookies and similar tools (we refer to them collectively as “cookies”) to provide our services, understand how our customers use our service in order to make improvements, serve advertisements, including interest-based advertising, and share information about the use of our site with our analytics, advertising and social media partners.

Cookies set by the site or app owner (in this case, AliExpress) are called “first party Cookies”. Cookies set by third parties other than the site or app owner are called “third party Cookies”. Third party Cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

By function, the Cookies we used are categorized as follows:

【More information about Cookies】

What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to our Platform. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Platform or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Platform to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Platform from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

How can I control Cookies?

California Do Not Track Notice

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

【Third-party SDKs】

To ensure the stable operation of the AliExpress mobile application or to implement related functions, we may integrate software development kits (SDKs) provided by third parties for the aforementioned purposes. We will exercise due diligence and conduct rigorous security monitoring of the software development kits (SDKs) used by our partners to access information, in order to protect data security.

The third-party SDKs we integrate primarily serve your needs. Therefore, we may adjust the third-party SDKs we integrate to meet new service requirements and business function changes. We will promptly disclose the latest information on integrated third-party SDKs in this statement. The third-party SDKs currently integrated into the AliExpress mobile application are listed below.
