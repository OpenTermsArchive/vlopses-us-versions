4.  TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS

4.1    Through the Sites, AliExpress.com provides an electronic web-based platform for exchanging information and concluding sale and purchase transactions of products and services online between buyers and sellers. AliExpress.com reserves the right to limit certain features and functions of the platform to prescribed Members. Despite the provision of the platform through the Sites, AliExpress.com does not represent the seller or the buyer in specific transactions whether or not such transactions are made on or via the Sites. AliExpress.com does not control and is not liable to or responsible for the quality, safety, lawfulness or availability of the products or services offered for sale on the Sites or the ability of the sellers to complete a sale or the ability of buyers to complete a purchase.

4.2    Members are hereby made aware that there may be risks of dealing with people acting under false pretences. AliExpress.com uses several techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Sites. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, AliExpress.com cannot and does not confirm each free member's purported identity shown on the Sites and can only use reasonable efforts to verify the personal identity of the representative of a seller in mainland China opening a storefront on www.aliexpress.com according to the applicable laws in mainland China. We encourage you to use the various tools available on the Sites, as well as common sense, to evaluate with whom you are dealing.

4.3    EACH MEMBER ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES OR SERVICE SHALL FULLY ASSUME THE RISKS OF CONDUCTING ANY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OR THROUGH THE SITES OR SERVICE.

EACH MEMBER AGREES THAT ALIEXPRESS.COM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITIES, COSTS, HARMS, INCONVENIENCES, BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS OR EXPENDITURES OF ANY KIND THAT MAY ARISE A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION RISKS.

MEMBER AGREES TO RELEASE AND INDEMNIFY ALIEXPRESS.COM (AND ALIEXPRESS.COM'S AGENTS, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES) FROM ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY ACTUAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSACTION RISK.

4.4    Members are solely responsible for setting out, agreeing on, entering into and performing all of the terms and conditions of the transactions conducted on, through or as a result of use of the Sites, including, without limitation, any non-performance, non-delivery, mis-delivery, theft, or other mistake or act in connection with the fulfillment of the orders, any non-conformity or defect in, any public or private recall of, or safety alert of any of the products or services such Member lists or sells through the Services, any terms regarding payment, refunds, returns, warranties, shipping, insurance, fees, taxes, title, licenses, fines, permits, handling, transportation and storage, subject to any additional obligations imposed under the Transactional Services Agreement (and in particular, clause 3.2). Any purchases made via the Services may be subject to the respective seller's additional terms and conditions of purchase. Each Member will promptly notify AliExpress.com as soon as such Member has knowledge of any public or private recalls, potential recalls, public notice of defect or failure to comply issued by any applicable government agency, an interim or permanent ban imposed by any applicable government agency, or safety alerts of the products and services such Member lists or sells through the Services. Each Member will promptly remove all listings for any product recalled by a manufacturer or governmental agency if the sale of the product is prohibited by law or regulation or the product poses a health or safety hazard as specified by any governmental agency, or if such product is subject to a public notice of defect or failure to comply issued by any applicable government agency, or if such product is subject to an interim or permanent ban imposed by any applicable government agency. Each Member will cooperate and assist AliExpress.com in connection with any recalls or safety alerts, including by initiating the procedures for returning items to such Member and destroying such recalled products thereafter. Each Member will be solely responsible for all costs and expenses the Member, AliExpress.com or any of AliExpress.com's affiliates incur in connection with any such recall or potential recall or safety alerts (including the costs to return, destroy, refund, store, repair, liquidate, or deliver to the Member or any vendor any of these recalled products). Neither AliExpress.com nor any of its affiliates has any responsibility or liability for the safety or performance of any product that each Member list or sell through the Services, including any product that is subject to a recall.

4.5    EACH MEMBER AGREES TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION AND MATERIALS AS MAY BE REASONABLY REQUIRED BY ALIEXPRESS.COM IN CONNECTION WITH ITS TRANSACTIONS MADE VIA THE TRANSACTIONAL PLATFORM ON THE SITES.

5.3    To the extent permitted by applicable laws, AliExpress.com reserves the right to, but shall have no obligation to, delete or edit any postings in its sole discretion without prior notice.

Each Member understands that by using the AliExpress.com discussion boards on the Sites, such Member may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.

5.4    Without prejudice to each Member's responsibilities under clause 3 of this Agreement, each Member agrees not to use the discussion boards on the Sites to:

4.  TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS

4.1    Through the Sites, AliExpress.com provides an electronic web-based platform for exchanging information and concluding sale and purchase transactions of products and services online between buyers and sellers. AliExpress.com reserves the right to limit certain features and functions of the platform to prescribed Members. Despite the provision of the platform through the Sites, AliExpress.com does not represent the seller or the buyer in specific transactions whether or not such transactions are made on or via the Sites. AliExpress.com does not control and is not liable to or responsible for the quality, safety, lawfulness or availability of the products or services offered for sale on the Sites or the ability of the sellers to complete a sale or the ability of buyers to complete a purchase.

4.2    Members are hereby made aware that there may be risks of dealing with people acting under false pretences. AliExpress.com uses several techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Sites. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, AliExpress.com cannot and does not confirm each free member's purported identity shown on the Sites and can only use reasonable efforts to verify the personal identity of the representative of a seller in mainland China opening a storefront on www.aliexpress.com according to the applicable laws in mainland China. We encourage you to use the various tools available on the Sites, as well as common sense, to evaluate with whom you are dealing.

Each Member will promptly notify AliExpress.com as soon as such Member has knowledge of any public or private recalls, potential recalls, public notice of defect or failure to comply issued by any applicable government agency, an interim or permanent ban imposed by any applicable government agency, or safety alerts of the products and services such Member lists or sells through the Services. Each Member will promptly remove all listings for any product recalled by a manufacturer or governmental agency if the sale of the product is prohibited by law or regulation or the product poses a health or safety hazard as specified by any governmental agency, or if such product is subject to a public notice of defect or failure to comply issued by any applicable government agency, or if such product is subject to an interim or permanent ban imposed by any applicable government agency.
