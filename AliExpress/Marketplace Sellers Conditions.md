========================================

Section I Violation Handling Measures
-------------------------------------

**Article 69** To safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of consumers, operators, and AliExpress, the platform may impose the following measures on members during the violation handling period in accordance with these rules. These measures may remain in effect until the risk is deemed largely controllable by AliExpress, at which point they may be partially or fully lifted:

(i) Warning – AliExpress may issue a verbal or written warning to sellers regarding improper conduct.

(ii) Search Ranking Adjustment – This refers to the adjustment of the ranking of all or part of a store's goods in search results.

(iii) Product Visibility Block – This refers to all goods (including compliant and non-compliant items) that will be hidden from front-end search results and only visible in the seller's own store.

(iv) In-platform Messaging Restriction – This refers to the restriction on sending in-platform messages within the AliExpress platform.

(v) Review Removal – This refers to the removal of store ratings and review content; removed reviews will not be counted in performance metrics.

(vi) Goods Listing Restriction – This refers to the restriction on posting new goods by the member on AliExpress.

(vii) Brand Delisting – This refers to the restriction or prohibition of displaying goods under specific brands on the platform.

(viii) Goods Delisting – This refers to the removal of a member’s product(s) from sale by AliExpress as a penalty measure.

(ix) Goods Deletion – This refers to the deletion of goods from the member's account by AliExpress as a penalty measure.

(x) Marketing Participation Restriction – This refers to the restriction to sellers on participating in marketing campaigns organized or supported by the platform.

(xi) Operating Privilege Closure – This refers to the closure of a seller's right to operate within specific or all business categories.

(xii) Advance Payment Feature Closure – This refers to closing the seller's access to early fund withdrawal services.

(xiii) Increase in Security Deposit for Stores – This refers to the requirement for violating stores to pay an increased security deposit in order to continue operating. Sellers must, within 14 days of receiving the payment notice, top up the store's security deposit to no less than CNY 30,000 before normal business operations can resume. Otherwise, all goods under the store may be subject to visibility restrictions in certain countries or regions.

(xiv) Account Freeze – This refers to the takedown of all active goods and restriction on new goods listings.

(xv) Seller Funds Freeze – This refers to the freeze of the seller's account funds (including but not limited to Alipay International and AliExpress accounts) until the platform determines that risks are under control.

(xvi) Account Closure – This refers to the freezing of the account, restriction on sending in-platform messages, suspension of store access, and a 180-day freeze on seller funds.

(xvii) AliExpress reserves the right to review and process the seller's remaining orders based on the severity of the violation at the time of account closure.

(xviii) Country-Specific Sales Restriction – This refers to the restriction on selling goods to specific countries.

(xix) Credit and Sales Record Deletion – This refers to the deletion of all or part of the seller's credit points and/or sales records for all or selected goods.

In addition to the aforementioned violation handling measures, if a seller violates applicable national laws, regulations, or platform rules, and such violation directly or indirectly causes AliExpress to suffer significant losses, AliExpress reserves the right to hold the seller fully liable for all resulting damages. These losses include, but are not limited to: any direct or indirect penalties imposed by regulatory authorities due to the seller's illegal actions; costs incurred by AliExpress in taking remedial actions to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the platform, other sellers, or buyers; any liquidated damages or compensation payable by AliExpress to third parties as a result of legal rulings; refunds, penalties, or compensation paid by AliExpress on behalf of the seller to buyers; legal fees incurred by AliExpress; and any other necessary expenses for mitigating adverse impact.

AliExpress will handle ongoing orders as follows:

1\. Orders placed but not paid by buyers: Orders will be closed.

2\. Orders paid but pending risk control review, and not yet shipped by seller: Orders will be closed, and full refunds will be issued to buyers. (Note: The platform defines "shipment" based on whether the seller has filled in and submitted a valid tracking number.)

3\. Orders paid and passed risk control review, but not yet shipped by seller: Orders will be frozen. The seller must provide shipping proof and procurement proof (and relevant qualification certificates for certain products). If the seller fails to provide valid documentation, the order will be closed and fully refunded to the buyer; if the documentation is verified, the order will be unfrozen and proceed through the normal transaction flow. (Note: The platform defines "shipment" based on whether the seller has filled in and submitted a valid tracking number.)

4\. Orders already shipped but with no disputes raised: Orders will be frozen. The seller must provide shipping proof and procurement proof (and relevant qualification certificates for certain products). If the seller fails to provide valid documentation, the order will be closed and fully refunded to the buyer; if the documentation is verified, the order will be unfrozen and proceed through the normal transaction flow.

5\. Orders with existing disputes: The seller must provide supporting evidence within the appeal period specified by the AliExpress platform. AliExpress will make a determination based on the evidence submitted by both the buyer and the seller.

6\. Orders successfully completed but not yet disbursed: The order payment will be frozen. The seller must provide shipping proof and procurement proof (and relevant qualification certificates for certain products). If the seller fails to provide valid documentation, the full order amount will be refunded to the buyer.

7\. Other order situations: For any other circumstances not explicitly covered above, the AliExpress platform may handle such cases at its discretion, and may require the seller to submit relevant supporting documentation for assessment.

8\. If a member is suspected of registering or controlling additional accounts on the AliExpress platform, the above order handling measures will also apply to orders associated with such related accounts.

Section II Violation Types and Handling Measures
------------------------------------------------

**Article 70** The platform classifies violations into four distinct point-based systems according to the nature of the misconduct: Intellectual Property Prohibited and Restricted Sales Violations, Transaction and Other Violations, Goods Information Quality Violations, and Severe Intellectual Property Violations. Each of the four point systems operates independently in terms of point deduction, accumulation, and enforcement of penalties.

**Article 71** Intellectual Property Prohibited and Restricted Sales Violations include general intellectual property infringement and illegal publication of prohibited or restricted items. When a seller accumulates 48 points under this category, the account will be closed.

**Article** **72** Severe Intellectual Property Violations include acts of serious intellectual property infringement. Accounts will be closed upon the third confirmed violation. If the infringement is deemed particularly severe, the account will be immediately closed without needing to reach three violations.

**Article 73** Transaction and Other Violations include transaction violations and other behaviors strictly prohibited by the platform. Once 48 points are accumulated under this category, the account will be closed.

**Article 74** Goods Information Quality Violations include misleading listings such as search manipulation and other publication-related violations. If a seller accumulates 12 points or every multiple of 12, the account will be frozen for 7 days.

**Article 75** Point reset logic: Each violation under the four point systems is calculated on a rolling 12-month (365-day) basis. For example, if 6 points are deducted at 12:00 PM on February 1, 2013, those 6 points will be reset at 12:00 PM on February 1, 2014.

**Article 76** AliExpress Four Point Systems and Penalty Threshold Overview:

| 48 points | Closure |
| Goods Information Quality Violations | 12 points and every multiple of 12 | Account freeze for 7 days |

**Article 77** If the business entity operating a seller account is suspected of registering or controlling other accounts on the platform simultaneously, AliExpress may take actions such as freezing the related accounts, increasing the related stores' security deposit, restricting operations in certain countries or regions, or removing the related stores from the platform. In cases involving malicious or intentional serious violations, or where infringement is particularly egregious or extreme, the platform will close all stores under that entity and reserves the right to confiscate all security deposits paid by those stores.

**Article 78** If a seller is subject to account closure or removal from the platform due to violations of platform rules, AliExpress shall, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of buyers and rights holders, freeze the seller's Alipay International account and AliExpress account for six months. In cases where the violation is particularly serious or egregious, the platform reserves the right to extend the freeze period to one year or two years. For violations that significantly disrupt platform order and cause actual harm to the platform or other sellers, AliExpress reserves the right to freeze the seller's Alipay International account and AliExpress account until reasonable compensation has been made to the affected party.

**Article 79** During the freeze period, the seller is prohibited from making withdrawals or conducting any other fund operations via their Alipay International or AliExpress account. All funds in these accounts will remain frozen.

**Article 80** During the freeze period, if the seller does not incur any refund, compensation, or dispute obligations, then upon the expiration of the freeze period, the platform will return any remaining funds in the Alipay International account (if any) to the seller and close the Alipay International account.

**Article 81** During the freeze period, if the seller becomes liable for refunds or compensation due to disputes, chargebacks by banks, or other reasons, the platform reserves the right to process the corresponding refunds or compensation directly from the seller's Alipay International and/or AliExpress account. Upon expiration of the freeze period, the remaining account balance (if any) will be returned to the seller, and both the Alipay International and AliExpress accounts will be closed.

**Article 85** Others

**I. Improper Gains**

Unfair profiteering refers to the behavior of members using improper means to seek benefits, including:

(i) Members offer money, gifts, entertainment, hospitality, or commercial opportunities to AliExpress staff and/or their affiliates;

(ii) Members seek improper benefits from AliExpress staff through other means.

If a member is found to have engaged in improper gain, regardless of whether any benefit was actually obtained: The member's store(s) and any affiliated store(s) will be permanently closed; AliExpress will permanently cease to provide or accept any products or services from the member; if the member has violated improper gain policies or committed other dishonest behavior on other Alibaba Group platforms (including but not limited to Alibaba China Site, Alibaba International Site, Taobao, and Tmall), leading to account closure, AliExpress reserves the right to take equivalent action on the member's AliExpress accounts, whether owned or controlled by them.

For service providers found to have engaged in improper gain, AliExpress will permanently cease to provide or accept any products or services from them; stores operated by the service provider must switch to self-operation or another provider within three months of receiving AliExpress notification. If they fail to do so within the specified time, AliExpress will impose supervision measures on the store until the required changes are completed.

If the member truthfully and voluntarily discloses or actively reports their involvement in improper gain, AliExpress may, at its discretion, apply lenient or mitigated penalties.

From the date an investigation into improper gain is initiated, AliExpress will restrict the member's store(s) and related store(s) from participating in any marketing activities until the investigation concludes.

If a member explicitly expresses intent to engage in improper gain toward AliExpress staff and/or their affiliates, or has already initiated such behavior, the member's store(s) will be permanently closed, even if the attempt was unsuccessful due to reasons beyond the member's control.

The following circumstances shall be deemed as acts of improper gain:

(i) The seller is an AliExpress employee – the member's store will be immediately and permanently closed.

(ii) The seller is an affiliate of an AliExpress employee who failed to declare the relationship in accordance with the Alibaba Group Code of Business Conduct, and the employee leveraged their position – the member's store will be immediately and permanently closed.

**II. Improper Marketing Practices**

Sellers must engage in marketing in a lawful, compliant, and reasonable manner. Without prior consent from the buyer, sellers must not contact buyers in a disruptive way for marketing purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, sending emails, making phone calls, sending SMS messages, or using AliExpress system tools to reach out to buyers for promotional activities.

It is strictly prohibited to display any form of contact information in product listings, including but not limited to email addresses, WeChat IDs, phone numbers, QQ, MSN, Skype, etc., whether in text fields or images. Sellers must not publish any promotional content for the purpose of advertising their store or products that includes such contact details or external links to third-party platforms (non-AliExpress), including but not limited to links or information embedded in goods titles, images, or detailed descriptions. Listings that attempt to attract buyers through promotional content while providing vague product descriptions or offering no actual product are considered violations. The inclusion of links to non-AliExpress websites in any part of the product description is strictly forbidden.

For such violations, AliExpress reserves the right to reject or remove the goods listing. If a seller accumulates a large number of such listings or commits repeated violations, AliExpress may, based on the severity of the behavior, deduct points and/or impose direct account penalties accordingly.

Section IV Liquidated Damages
-----------------------------

**Article 87** If a seller accumulates a total of 48 penalty points due to severe intellectual property violations, prohibited/restricted product listings, transaction violations and other violations, or if the account is directly closed in accordance with platform rules, the platform reserves the right to fully confiscate the security deposit paid on that account as compensation for the seller's breach of contract. If the seller is found to have committed intentional and serious violations, engaged in particularly egregious infringement, or clearly acted with malicious intent to evade platform control rules, the platform also reserves the right to confiscate the security deposit paid by the other associated accounts under the same entity.

**Article 88** If the remaining balance of the security deposit is insufficient for AliExpress to deduct the corresponding amount of the liquidated damages, the seller shall be responsible for paying the shortfall to AliExpress. If MYBank only fulfills part of the penalty to the platform, the seller shall be responsible for paying the shortfall to AliExpress.

**Article 89** If the seller's actions cause greater actual losses to the platform, AliExpress reserves the right to pursue further compensation from the seller until the full amount of the loss is recovered.

AliExpress Review Policy

Release date: July 31, 2024

Revision date: September 11, 2025

  

1\. Scope of application
========================

In order to ensure that every user of the AliExpress.com platform (referred to in this policy as "AliExpress" or the "Platform") can enjoy a fair and honest shopping experience, and to maintain a fair and competitive business environment, AliExpress has established this review policy (the “**Review Policy**”).

This Review Policy applies to all users of the Platform who submit for publication on the Platform any form of comment, evaluation, opinion, recommendation or rating about an experience with a product, a seller or the Platform (such user being a “**Reviewer**” and their comment, evaluation, opinion, recommendation or rating being a “**Review**”). This Review Policy sets out certain rules which all Reviewers, and the Reviews they submit, must comply with.

This Review Policy does not apply to feedback and/or complaints from users which are not intended for publication. To open a dispute or submit a report about a seller, please click [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/seller-report/nav.html). For any other support, please contact our help centre [here](https://helpcenter.aliexpress.com/s/BuyerHelp?spm=a2g0o.home.sitefooter.1.33f16278V1Kb6k&language=en_US&tsuCode=ByrCmn&terminal=pc&region=UK&suid=1030142508201815392141239C3682).

2\. How to submit a Review
==========================

A user may submit a Review in relation to a completed order by clicking on "Write a review" within the "My orders" page when logged into their AliExpress account. Logged in users may also submit answers through the app about products they have purchased, which may constitute a Review (if the definition in section 1 above is met), in response to other users' questions.

Reviewers should submit Reviews with the following purposes in mind:

1) to provide sellers with honest feedback regarding their experience with the relevant product; and

2) to help other buyer users obtain genuine information about products.

3\. Review Rules
================

All Reviews must reflect the Reviewer’s genuine experience with a product purchased on the Platform, a seller on the Platform or another aspect of the Platform and meet the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, as well as the [AliExpress Community Guidelines](https://rule.aliexpress.com/rule-channels/37978936/137261302).

The following practices are **not permitted** on the Platform:

**(1) Submission of fake Reviews**, being Reviews which are not based on the Reviewer’s genuine experience of a product purchased on the Platform, a seller on the Platform or another aspect of the Platform.

**(2) Submission of incentivised Reviews**, being Reviews provided in exchange for rewards by sellers or third parties (such as money, coupons, gift cards, free or discounted products, etc.) and Reviews from or on behalf of individuals with a financial interest in the product or seller.

**(3) Submission of malicious Reviews**, being Reviews intended to damage a seller’s reputation or business which are not isolated, genuine Reviews.

**(4) Aggregation of hijacked Reviews**, which means the aggregation of Reviews which represent that they relate to a particular product, when in reality they relate to a different product.

Users who suspect that a Review contravenes this Review Policy may report that review to us for further investigation by clicking on the ellipsis provided next that Review.

4\. Violations and penalties
============================

AliExpress will remove any fake, incentivised, malicious and/or hijacked Reviews identified on the Platform, as well as any other Reviews which AliExpress deems to violate this Review Policy. Where applicable, AliExpress will update a seller’s or product’s average rating and review count to exclude any removed Reviews.

AliExpress may also take further action against violations of this Review Policy, including but not limited to by taking one or more of the following steps in relation to a product or a seller:

1) demoting search rankings for products where necessary as a result of any updated average rating;

2) banning user accounts;

3) banning users from leaving Reviews;

4) disapplying Review functionalities in relation to certain products;

5) removing all Reviews for a seller or a product;

6) delisting product listings;

#### 4.3.7 Example 7 - SKU with different quantity units: quantity units (such as the number of pieces) are set for non-quantity unit SKUs with large price differences, or the product is posted with abnormal quantity units, for instance, color options are set with different number of pieces instead of different colors and the price difference for different color options is relatively large; the products that shall be sold in pairs are set with the SKU of a single item of one pair and the SKU of one pair of the product.

Example: color options are set with different number of pieces, and the price difference between different color options is large and the lowest price does not match the product details displayed in the main product picture, which may easily lead to buyers’ complaints.

Example: for the products that are usually sold in pairs, one piece of the pair of the product and one pair of the product are set in the same product link.

#### 4.3.8 Any other abnormal SKU settings with large price differences, which may affect buyers’ search and shopping experience.

3、Penalties for Violations
--------------------------

The platform has the right to raise or mitigate the penalties depending on the severity of the violation, i.e., posting prohibited or controlled items, and the member’s acts.

Examples of malicious acts include but are not limited to evading system monitoring utilizing secretive means such as hiding, blocking or blurring product information, utilizing implicit description, or willfully through vague descriptions or deliberate mis-categorization; listing a large number of prohibited items at the same time; repeatedly publishing non-compliant information; maliciously testing the regulations. For malicious violations, the penalty will be raised depending on the severity. For example, the penalty will be doubled for a general violation, or in the case of serious violation, the relevant account will be closed.

Raised penalties for general violations: for a general violation that is identified as a malicious violation, the penalty will be raised (if the same violation occurs again, the penalty points will be doubled for the second time)

(b) AliExpress does not search for items that may raise these types of issues, nor can it

review copies of private contracts, or adjudicate or take sides in private contract disputes. However, we want you to be aware that posting items in violation of your contractual obligations could put you at risk with third parties. AliExpress therefore urges that you not list any item until you have reviewed any relevant contracts or agreements, and are confident you can legally sell it on the Site.

(c) If you have any questions regarding your rights under a contract or agreement, we

strongly recommend that you contact the company with whom you entered into the contract and/or consult with an attorney.

20.5 Event ticket resale policy

AliExpress allows the listing of tickets to performance, sporting and entertainment events to the extent permitted by law. However, as a ticket seller, you are responsible for ensuring that your particular transaction does not violate any applicable law or the terms on the ticket itself.

20.6 Stolen property

(a) The posting or sale of stolen property is strictly forbidden on the Site, and violates international law. Stolen property includes items taken from private individuals, as well as property taken without authorization from companies or governments.

(b) AliExpress supports and cooperates with law enforcement efforts involving the recovery of stolen property and the prosecution of responsible individuals. If you are concerned that the images and/or text in your item description have been used by another Site user without your authorization, or that your intellectual property rights have been violated by such user, please contact our service team at alibaba@service.alibaba.com.

PART 3 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION POLICY
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 1\. FACES, NAMES AND SIGNATURES

Items containing the likeness, image, name, or signature of another person are prohibited, unless the products were made or authorized by the person whose likeness, image, name or signature has been used.

### 2\. REPLICA AND COUNTERFEIT ITEMS

2.1 Listing of counterfeits, non-licensed replicas, or unauthorized items, such as counterfeit designer garments, watches, handbags, sunglasses, or other accessories, is strictly prohibited on the Site.

2.2 If the products sold bear the name or logo of a company, but did not originate from or were not endorsed by that company, such products are prohibited from the Site.

2.3 Postings of branded products are permitted if a certificate of authorization has been issued by the brand owner.

2.4 Postings offering to sell or purchase replicas, counterfeits or other unauthorized items shall be subject to removal by AliExpress. Repeated postings of counterfeit or unauthorized items shall result in the immediate suspension of your membership.

### 3\. SOFTWARE

3.1 Academic Software

(a) Academic software is software sold at discounted prices to students, teachers, and employees of accredited learning institutions.

(b) On the Site, please do not list any academic software unless you are so authorized. Postings violating AliExpress' s academic software policy may be deleted prior to publication.

(c) For postings of academic software on behalf of an authorized educational reseller or an educational institution, such licensure must be stated conspicuously in the listings. A certificate of authorization issued by the authorized educational reseller (or the educational institution) must also be provided to AliExpress.

3.2 OEM Software

(a) Do not list "OEM" or "bundled" copies of software on the AliExpress Sites unless you are selling it with computer hardware. Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), or bundled software, is software that is obtained as part of the purchase of a new computer. OEM software licenses usually prohibit the purchaser from reselling the software without the computer or, in some cases, without any computer hardware.

### 4\. UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The listing or sale of unauthorized (pirated, duplicated, backup, bootleg, etc.) copies of software programs, video games, music albums, movies, television programs, photographs or other protected works is forbidden on the Site.

**Why is a product recall implemented?**

Product recall refers to the process where a product sold is found to be defective and needs to be recovered from the end user. When a product has been recalled in certain countries, in order to protect the personal safety and property of consumers, AliExpress will prohibit sellers from selling this product in these countries.

**Where can information about product recalls be obtained?**

1、Recall announcements or directives issued by regulators in various countries, e.g. [Rapid Alert System for Non-Food Products (RAPEX, EU)](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumers_safety/safety_products/rapex/alerts/?event=main.listNotifications&lng=en), [OPSS (UK)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-safety-database-unsafe-products), [EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF)](https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en), [OECD Global Recalls Portal](https://globalrecalls.oecd.org/#/), [USDA](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts), [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts), [CPSC](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls), [Health Canada/Transport Canada](https://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/index-eng.php), [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)](https://www.accc.gov.au/topics/recalls?spm=5261.ams_108617.0.0.2b7065252KwsuB). Such recalls are generally announced by these regulators on their websites. The content of these announcements usually includes the name of the product (identification information), risk type, the nature of the problem, the regions of the affected product, and remedial measures for buyers.

2、Recalls initiated by the manufacturer or actual producer. For such recalls, the manufacturer, brand owner, or supplier directly informs retailers and other supply chain partners of the product issues before regulators intervene (or in some cases, without the intervention of regulators at all).

**Measures taken by AliExpress in a product recall**

After receiving relevant information about a product recall, AliExpress will take measures including but not limited to the following:

1、Check the recalled products and, as appropriate, inspect the same type of products sold on the AliExpress platform

2、Block the recalled products or other similar products from displaying in certain countries or remove them directly

3、Contact and notify sellers to recall the products that have been sold, and demand due diligence in the recall and handling process

4、Formulate control measures to prevent recalled products from entering the market again Report the handling of recalled products to overseas regulatory agencies according to laws, regulations or regulatory requirements

5、Demand sellers to tighten quality and safety risk control

6、Strengthen education and legal publicity for sellers to provide guidance on sales that meet compliance requirements

7、Other measures deemed appropriate by the platform

**Obligations of AliExpress sellers during a product recall**

After receiving a product recall request from AliExpress, sellers shall comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding recalls, and take the following measures:

1、Immediately contact all buyers in the region of the recall, and recall relevant products or provide return/refund services; properly dispose of the recalled products

2、Stop selling similar products to these regions or remove these products

3、Intercept affected product in transit or take corresponding recall measures

4、If damage is caused to consumers, they shall be compensated

5、In accordance with corresponding laws, regulations or regulatory requirements, report product recalls to regulatory agencies, cooperate with their investigations, and respond promptly

6、Actively cooperate with the platform in investigations and provide relevant documents or test reports

7、Enhance compliance awareness, and conduct own inspection of other products in the stores to prevent similar incidents in the future

**If a buyer purchased a product marked for recall, what should the buyer do?**

If you have purchased a recalled product, please stop using it immediately, or you can contact the seller to request a return/replacement/refund.

Thank you for your attention and support!

3、Violation and Penalties
-------------------------

Based on comprehensive risk investigations conducted by the platform, including data analysis, feedback from buyers or other sellers, and various potential risks, sellers' goods, transactions, etc., are evaluated for risks associated with illegal profit-making behaviors. Illegal profit-making behaviors are categorized as general violations, serious violations, and particularly serious violations based on severity.

General Violation: The platform determines that the seller has engaged in illegal profit-making behavior, but the number of orders involved or the amount of illegal profits is small, and the severity of the situation is minor.

Serious Violation: The platform determines that the seller has engaged in illegal profit-making behavior, and the number of orders involved or the amount of illegal profits is large, or the proportion of illegal profits to the store's total transaction amount is high, or it has caused consumers a negative shopping experience, or the platform has issued a warning but no corrective action has been taken.

Particularly Serious Violation: The platform determines that the seller has engaged in illegal profit-making behavior, using egregious methods, and the number of orders involved or the amount of illegal profits is significantly large, or the proportion of illegal profits to the store's total transaction amount is very high, or it has caused consumers a serious negative shopping experience or damages to the platform, or the platform has issued two or more warnings or penalties, and the store continues to violate the rules.

**Penalties:**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Violation Category** | **Penalty Measures** |
| General Violation | 6 points/time |
| Serious Violation | 12 points/time |
| Particularly Serious Violation | 48 points/time |

Suppose the platform discovers that a seller is suspected of illegal profit-making. In that case, the platform has the right to immediately take restrictive measures against the seller, including but not limited to restricting product listing permissions, removing online products, freezing the seller's account, freezing the seller's Alipay account/AliExpress account, and extending the loan repayment time. The platform also has the right to close orders related to illegal profit-making behaviors (such as orders obtained by taking advantage of coupons) regardless of the order status (even if the seller has shipped the order or the order status is already marked as successful). After closing the order, the payment will be refunded to the buyer, and the platform subsidy will be returned to the platform. At the same time, if the seller has obtained platform subsidies through illegal profit-making behaviors, the platform has the right to demand that the seller bear breach of contract liability and directly deduct an amount equal to the funds involved in the illegal profit-making from the seller's Alipay international account or AliExpress account as liquidated damages. If there is an insufficient amount for a deduction, AliExpress has the right to continue to recover the remaining amount from the seller.

In addition to the penalties mentioned above, if the seller causes damage to the platform through illegal profit-making, the platform has the right to seek compensation from the seller and reserves other remedies permitted by law, including reporting to public security or procuratorial authorities.

Note 1: If you have objections to the related penalties or the orders involved in the violations, please file an online appeal against the punishment for illegal profit-making or serious disruption of platform order on the Merchant Backstage - Violations page. Please be sure to initiate the appeal within the time limit specified on the penalty page and submit supporting materials for each order, including but not limited to authentic and valid delivery orders or delivery certificates provided by the official postal service, logistics in transit proof, and logistics package weight settlement information. Please refer to the penalty notice for specific instructions. If your appeal is rejected or exceeds the appeal deadline during the appeal period, the platform will enforce the penalties and deduct the liquidated damages based on the content of the penalty notice. For clarity, the calculation of liquidated damages will be based on the final details of the violation order.

4、Interpretation
----------------

How should the funds involved in illegal profits be understood?

It refers to the subsidies provided by the AliExpress platform, such as platform coupons or other benefits, that are associated with violation orders committed during the seller's operation. These subsidies are funds provided by the platform to buyers in the form of promotional measures or other entitlements.

Taking platform coupons as an example, they are a type of promotional measure provided by the platform using its own funds. They are a form of preferential treatment that allows buyers to enjoy a certain amount of discount when making purchases. After the buyer uses the platform coupon during the transaction, the seller can directly or indirectly obtain cash from the platform by settling through the system or through manual means. If a seller illegally profits by taking advantage of coupons issued by the platform during their operation on the platform, the funds involved in illegal profits refer to the total sum of the face value of the coupons used by buyers in violation orders associated with the seller.

Note: When deducting the liquidated damages (an amount equal to the funds involved in illegal profits), the platform will convert the face value of the coupons into the currency of the seller's funding account based on the real-time exchange rate provided by the Bank of China. If a buyer requests a refund for a violation order or initiates a dispute process (such as a "dispute") or a chargeback in the system, the order will still be handled based on the platform's dispute rules and chargeback rules. The costs and liabilities associated with resolving disputes or chargebacks caused by disputes or chargebacks are the direct responsibility of the seller.

AliExpress "Online Assessment" Rules

Latest revision date: May 6, 2022 (Beijing Time)

On April 19, 2022, AliExpress held its annual merchant summit and presented the three most important things for AliExpress in 2022. One of them is to "accelerate the improvement of global logistics fulfillment capabilities, incentivize merchants who fulfill orders quickly, and deliver goods within 72 hours with an online rate >90%." Fulfillment certainty is an important reason for consumers to continue repurchasing. In order to improve the consumer receiving experience and safeguard the rights and interests of more merchants with quality supply chains, one of the key areas for service improvement in 2022 is how to improve the 72-hour online rate and obtain more platform benefits.

This set of rules will introduce the definition of the online rate rule, assessment scope, incentive policies, control policies, and suggestions for improving shipping capabilities to help merchants improve their shipping abilities. These rules were officially released on April 28, 2022 (Beijing Time), and the public notice period for the rules is from April 28, 2022 to May 5, 2022. The rules will officially take effect from May 6, 2022.

1、Updates to the Online Rate Rules
----------------------------------

### （1）Description of the 24-hour/48-hour/72-hour/5-day online rate indicators

1) Numerator: The number of orders in the past 30 days that have been shipped within 24 hours/48 hours/72 hours/5 days after the logistics online time (minus the time for successful payment and risk control review).

2) Denominator: The number of orders that have been successfully paid (after risk control review) in the past 30 days, minus the number of canceled orders that were successfully canceled or expired.

3) The calculation is done based on Pacific Time, with a 7-day buffer for logistics online feedback delay. For example, the data on January 8 is the data from 30 days prior, starting from January 1.

4) All calculations are based on natural days, with the following exceptions:

**·** For orders shipped from mainland China, the effective time for calculation is Monday to Saturday. Sundays, public holidays, National Day holidays, and Spring Festival holidays are not included in the 24-hour/48-hour/72-hour/5-day period.

**·** For orders shipped from Hong Kong warehouses, the effective time for calculation is Monday to Friday. Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays, National Day holidays, and Spring Festival holidays are not included in the 24-hour/48-hour/72-hour/5-day period.

**·** For orders shipped from overseas warehouses, the effective time for calculation is Monday to Friday. Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays in respective countries are not included in the 24-hour/48-hour/72-hour/5-day period.

### （2）Assessment scope of online rate indicators

Taking into account merchants' operations and logistics collection and delivery situations, the following types of orders are temporarily not assessed for the online rate indicators, while all other orders will be included in the calculation of the 24-hour/48-hour/72-hour/5-day online rate indicators:

1) Customized attribute orders: Orders with a delivery period of more than 7 days are not assessed. A notice on the adjustment of customized attribute categories on AliExpress is expected to be released in May 2022. Please pay attention to platform notifications.

2) Links for price adjustment of special categories are not assessed.

3) Orders for special items (such as large items, liquid powders, etc.) that are shipped through custom shipping methods are not assessed.

4) For orders in overseas warehouse routes, orders generated using non-Cainiao official warehouse routes or non-platform direct trajectory data are not assessed.

5) Other situations are not assessed for a long time or temporarily based on platform discretion. For example, during recent global epidemic outbreaks, the platform will actively exempt merchants from responsibility based on the impact of the epidemic, and support for exemption indicators should be based on the latest announcements. For details, click here: 2022 Epidemic-related Shop Assessment Exemption Information Announcement Section, AliExpress and merchants working together during difficult times (constantly updated).

### （3）Querying and downloading details of the online rate indicators

Note: We recommend that you use the relevant pages to check the latest indicator rules after the rules come into effect on May 6. The details displayed on the product page should prevail.

1) You can log in to the seller's backend, and go to \[Store\] - \[My Store\] - \[Seller Service Score\], to check the online rate indicators for your store.

2) You can log in to the seller's backend, go to \[Business Insights\] - \[Logistics Overview\], to check the online rate indicators for your store.

3) You can log in to the seller's backend, go to \[Business Insights\] - \[Product Analysis\], to check the online rate indicators for your products.

### （4）FAQ

Q: What specific time does the logistics online time refer to in the online rate?

A: The logistics online time refers to the first information provided by the logistics provider. For online shipping, it is generally the time when the order is shipped from the warehouse, picked up by the delivery service provider, or delivered to the destination country. The actual shipping method should be used as the reference.

Q: When there are multiple logistics tracking numbers for the same transaction order, which logistics tracking number's time should be considered for the online time?

A: For a transaction order with one or more items, each item should have its corresponding shipping notification tracking number. All tracking numbers should have online logistics information within 24 hours/48 hours/72 hours/5 days in order for the order to be counted as an online order within that time frame. It is recommended to accurately fill in the tracking numbers corresponding to each item.

Q: For products belonging to a category with a set lead time of more than 7 days, is the assessment based on the actual lead time set for the product or the lead time set for the category the product belongs to?

A: The assessment is based on the actual lead time set for the product. If the lead time set for your actual product is ≤7 days, your orders will participate in the assessment as usual, and if they meet the criteria, you will enjoy the benefits.

2、Platform has a series of incentive policies and will implement them gradually for products and merchants with excellent delivery efficiency
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 72-hour online rate indicator will be applied in search ranking, Gold and Silver Seller Access, marketing enrollment, and grouped order enrollment. Sellers with excellent online rates will have more opportunities to receive search recommendations, Gold and Silver Seller Access, and marketing enrollment opportunities.

（1）Positive impact on search ranking: Preferred warehouses & overseas warehouses > 24-hour online rate > 48-hour online rate > 72-hour online rate. Faster delivery will give your products a higher-ranking advantage on top of the natural search ranking.

（2）Grouped orders/cross-border expedited delivery, etc.: For products that meet the requirements of the 72-hour online rate, the platform will provide additional labeling, exposure, and exclusive marketing benefits. For details, click here to view the Introduction to Upgraded Grouped Orders and the Introduction to 72-hour expedited delivery.

（3）Gold and Silver Seller Access and Exclusion: Starting from July, the 72-hour online rate will be included in the assessment criteria for Gold and Silver Seller Access and Exclusion. The specific implementation details and timing will be announced at a later date. Please pay attention to platform notifications.

3、Platform benefits will be affected for products and merchants with slow delivery efficiency
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

（1）Platform marketing campaign access: The online rate will be included in the threshold for participating in platform marketing campaigns, and products that do not meet the criteria will not be able to participate in platform campaigns.

**·** Currently, the platform uses a 5-day online rate >80% for products in the store as the standard for participating in platform campaigns. For details, click here: \[AliExpress Rules\] - \[Marketing Rules\]. Products that do not meet the criteria will not be able to participate in platform campaigns.

**·** The standard for participating in marketing campaigns will gradually be upgraded to the 72-hour online rate. It is expected that important marketing fields on the platform will prioritize this starting in May. Please refer to the activity enrollment page for specific activities and criteria.

（2）Store service assessment: The indicator will be included in the merchant service score, and the platform will define the online rate assessment criteria in the merchant service score. If it is significantly lower than the industry standard, it may result in a lower search ranking.

4、Platform suggestions for improving the online rate
----------------------------------------------------

（1）We recommend that you maintain a certain level of inventory and manage your inventory well. Ship orders as soon as possible to improve customer satisfaction.

（2）Encourage stocking popular products in preferred warehouses and overseas warehouses to ensure inventory and achieve fast shipping and online rates. For instructions on stocking in preferred warehouses and overseas warehouses, click here to view the Preferred Warehouse System Operation Manual and Overseas Warehouse Introduction, and the Commitment to Reach Introduction.

（3）We recommend using the platform's grouped packaging feature, extending the online time by 12 to 48 hours. For instructions on using the grouped packaging feature, click here to view the Cross-Border Collection Service Online Introduction. If your region is not covered by the collection service, we recommend using the Cainiao Remote Area Collection Service.

AliExpress reaffirms "seller's obligation to declare truthfully"

Dear Sellers,

According to relevant laws and regulations, sellers should voluntarily fulfill (or urge consumers to fulfill) tax and customs clearance obligations. Sellers must not understate, conceal, or falsely report transaction information at the import and export stages, nor help buyers evade or pay fewer taxes. Such violations include but are not limited to making statements or implications in store pages, product descriptions, or other channels of communication with buyers that various illegal tax avoidance operations can be carried out.

**Examples of violation information include but are not limited to:**

**·** avoid tax

**·** declare lower value

**·** avoid value-added tax

**·** tax evasion

**·** declared the item as a gift

To demonstrate the platform's prohibition attitude towards suspected illegal behavior, the Global AliExpress platform rules will add an item (8) to the "Illegal Profit" rule: For sales purposes, sellers are suspected of engaging in or assisting buyers in various illegal tax avoidance behaviors in any explicit or implicit manner. This modification will take effect from January 20, 2020.

Sellers are requested to thoroughly check and inspect their stores' product information. If there is any violation information mentioned above, please immediately delete and rectify it. The self-rectification period for sellers starts from the date of this announcement until January 20, 2020. After the self-rectification period, the platform will further strengthen the investigation of such violation information. Once discovered, the relevant products will be deleted, and 0.5 points will be deducted. In severe cases, the platform reserves the right to freeze or close the account.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation.

AliExpress "Transaction but Not Selling" Rules

Latest Revision Date: September 16, 2022, Beijing Time

1、Scope
-------

We are committed to making AliExpress the preferred platform for overseas buyers in cross-border shopping. It is the primary obligation of sellers to strictly adhere to the promised price, delivery time, logistics services, and product quality when fulfilling orders placed by buyers. However, the platform has found that some sellers have caused a large number of products to be undelivered due to their own reasons, resulting in the closure of orders due to delivery timeouts. This has caused extremely negative experiences for buyers, leading to disputes and complaints. In order to maintain a healthy and orderly marketplace and enhance the shopping experience for buyers on the platform, these rules are formulated.

2、Definition and Manifestations
-------------------------------

Definition of "Transaction but Not Selling": Refers to the behavior of sellers failing to ship the order after the buyer has made payment. The aforementioned delay refers to the failure to upload the tracking number before the seller's shipping timeout.

Based on the severity, the behavior of "Transaction but Not Selling" is categorized as general violation, severe violation, and particularly severe violation.

Examples of particularly severe violations of "Transaction but Not Selling" include but are not limited to the following situations, with particularly severe circumstances constituting particularly severe violations:

（1）A large number of "Transaction but Not Selling" orders or a significant proportion of "Transaction but Not Selling" orders in the seller's store within the past 7 days or 30 days.

（2）Intentional "Transaction but Not Selling" for improper purposes such as diverting traffic.

（3）Repeated occurrences of general violations of "Transaction but Not Selling".

3、Violation Categories and Penalty Measures
-------------------------------------------

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Violation Category** | **Penalty Measures** |

AliExpress Explanation of the Assessment Criteria for "Transaction but Not Selling"

Effective Date: December 2, 2020, Beijing Time

Dear sellers,

It is the basic obligation of sellers to strictly adhere to the promised price, delivery time, logistics services, and product quality. In order to maintain a healthy and orderly marketplace, enhance the shopping experience of buyers on the platform, and help sellers better provide services to consumers, the following changes are made to the assessment criteria for "Transaction but Not Selling":

"Transaction but Not Selling" refers to the behavior of sellers failing to ship the order after the buyer has made payment. The aforementioned delay refers to the failure to upload the tracking number before the seller's shipping deadline (including cases where partial shipment is made but not all items are confirmed as shipped before the seller's shipping timeout), resulting in the order being closed by the system. Note: If the cancellation of the order is initiated by the buyer, it will not be counted as "Transaction but Not Selling" in the assessment. Please refer to the "Global AliExpress Transaction but Not Selling Rules" for more details.

**FAQ:**

Q: What is the current cancellation process in general?

A: If a consumer requests to cancel an order, the seller should respond within 72 hours. If there is no response from the seller within 72 hours, the order will be closed due to timeout, and the payment will be refunded to the buyer. The order status will be displayed as "Order Closed." Note: Buyer-initiated cancellations before payment do not require seller confirmation and will be automatically closed by the system.

  

Q: Will agreeing to a buyer's cancellation request have any impact on my store?

A: If the cancellation of the order is initiated by the buyer, any reasons for canceling the order will not have any impact on your store (it will not be counted as "Transaction but Not Selling"). Note: You do not need to guide the consumer to modify the cancellation reason. On the contrary, you can identify the shortcomings in store management through the reasons for order cancellations provided by consumers, which can help you better operate your store.

Q: Why was the order automatically closed even though I did not agree to the buyer's cancellation request?

A:

（1）If you do not respond within 72 hours, the order is affected by the cancellation rules and will be automatically closed.

（2）If you have engaged in some violations, the platform may close the order. For example, if the consumer complains about your lack of stock, price increase, refusal to ship, etc., and the platform verifies the evidence and finds the situation to be true, the order will be closed.

（3）For unpaid orders, buyer cancellations do not require your confirmation and will be automatically closed by the system.

Q: Does this apply to all orders or only to new orders?

A: This applies to all orders.

As of now, 137 countries have joined the Minamata Convention and have committed to gradually phasing out and restricting the production and import/export of mercury-containing products to reduce mercury emissions and exposure. Due to the requirements of the relevant international conventions, laws and regulations and regulatory requirements of various countries, in order to protect the rights and interests of users and the ecological environment, and maintain the sustainable and healthy development of the AliExpress, AliExpress prohibits the listing and sale of Mercury-containing products.

Based on the above conventions and related regulations, AliExpress has banned the sale of liquid mercury and mercury-containing products and closed related categories from May 1, 2022.

（图五）

五、违规处理
------

平台禁止发布相关商品及服务，请各卖家对店铺和商品进行自查，按照本规则进行商品发布，删除并停止出售以上相关违规商品及服务，避免产生违规处置。

对于违反本规则的行为，平台将根据[《全球速卖通卖家基础规则（违规及处罚规则）》](https://rule.aliexpress.com/rule-channels/36963666/122523039)[《全球速卖通禁限售规则（含违禁信息列表）》](https://rule.aliexpress.com/rule-channels/36963666/122523647)的规定，对违规商品信息予以下架或删除，相关订单如买家已付款，无论物流状况如何，均全额退款给买家，卖家承担全部责任，并根据违规行为的严重程度，对卖家给予冻结账户或关闭账户的处罚。

普通刀具依据本规则需要在特定类目下销售，如错放类目针对相关商品第一次进行下架，第二次进行一般违规扣分，2分/次；一般违规，一天内（即首次违规处罚时间起24小时内）累计扣分不超过12分；严重违规每次扣48分，关闭账号；针对恶意规避等情节特别严重行为（包含但不限于采用对商品信息隐藏、遮挡、模糊处理等隐匿的手段规避平台管理），平台保留直接扣除48分，关闭账号的权利。

六、相关问题解答
--------

1、自锁刀可以发布吗？

刀具的自锁装置，是指折刀在使用过程中，为了防止因为用力而产生刀刃回折，对使用者的手部造成伤害而设置的一种锁闭机构，通常见到的有线锁、轴锁、背锁和弹簧刀的锁定装置，由于对人体有伤害，因此在平台上也是禁止发布的。

2、Cosplay用的动漫刀可以发布么？

除了刀刃为金属材质的武士刀，其他的动漫刀可以发布，须按相应类目要求发布。

3、少数民族刀可以发布么？

少数民族刀具只允许在自治区销售，而网络销售势必存在跨地域情况，所以少数民族藏刀、腰刀、靴刀、马刀等都是不可以发布的。其他的少数民族刀具则沿用管制刀具的判断标准，是否自锁、有血槽或者超长等。

4、陶瓷材质的刀具可以发布么？

陶瓷类刀具须符合上述管控要求和商品发布要求。

由于陶瓷类刀具具有超高硬度、超高耐磨、刃口锋利等特点，其技术特性已达到或超过了部分金属刀具的性能，对符合管制刀具认定标准规定的刀具类型、刀刃长度和刀尖角度等条件的陶瓷类刀具，应当作为管制刀具管理。

七、附则
----

1、本规则自2022年8月15日起生效，请商家对照规则详情自行整改属性和发布类目。

2、2022年9月1日起，平台将依据规则对违规商品下架或删除处理。

3、平台享有对本规则的解释权，并有权依据业务发展及法律法规要求，对本规则进行修改。最新规则修订请关注平台通知。

全球速卖通关于规范管理地图及其相关制品的公告

**发布日期：北京时间2017/9/29**

**最新版本修订日期：北京时间2022/10/9**

亲爱的卖家：  
地图直接体现国家领土完整与民族尊严，具有很强的严肃性与科学性。为落实地图制品的规范、科学、严谨管理，我国《地图管理条例》明确规定，向社会公开的地图，应当报送有审核权的测绘地理信息行政主管部门审核，依法执行地图审核制度，获取“地图审图号”。

平台自2022年10月10日起，将加强地图相关商品管控：

**1、地图商品必须发布在以下类目：**

办公、文化及教育用品>>地图和地图集

办公、文化及教育用品>>教学设备及用品>>教学用具>>地球仪

办公、文化及教育用品>>教学设备及用品>>教学用具>>磁性地球仪

**2、在商品资质模块填写商品的“地图审图号”。**

国务院测绘行政主管部门审图号为：GS（××××年）××××号〔如：GS（2004）001号〕

省级测绘行政主管部门审图号为：省（自治区、直辖市）简称S（××××年）××××号〔如：京S（2004）006号〕

**3、地图上禁止出现危害国家主权统一、领土完整的错绘漏绘，包括错误表示台湾省、错绘藏南地区和阿克赛钦地区国界线，漏绘钓鱼岛、赤尾屿、南海诸岛、南海十段线等。**

对于不合格商品，速卖通将依照平台规则对“宣传国家分裂及其他各国禁止传播发布的敏感信息”相关商品或信息进行删除、下架或严重违规处理。  
**特别注意**：请勿**随意填写伪造或错误的审图号或冒用他人所持有的审图号**，此类行为属于《地图管理条例》第五十二条规定的“伪造、冒用地图审核批准文件和审图号”的严重违法行为，将承担严厉的法律责任。请卖家务必做好自检自查工作，若存在此类行为，请尽快修正或撤回错填、伪造、冒用的审图号信息。

**若您的商品还未获得“地图审图号”，您可以访问zwfw.ch.mnr.gov.cn/approval 免费申请：**

注：如果为省、市等地方性地图，需到各省市对应的测绘局申请。

**常见问题FAQ：**

1、怎么判断商品是否需要地图审图号？

答：检查商品上是否含有地图LOGO、地图图形。如果有，通常均需要地图审图号。

2、去哪审批？

答：可网上申请办理，网址：zwfw.ch.mnr.gov.cn/approval，（网址下滑到底）“行政审批>>地图审核”。如果您的商品为省、市等中国地方性地图，请向区域当地有审核权的测绘局进行申请。

3、地图审图号审批时长？申请费用？

答：常规地图，自受理地图审核申请之日起20个工作日内作出审核决定；无收费。具体可咨询国家测绘地理信息局地图技术审查中心。

4、地图审批需提供的资料有哪些？

答：相关资料见：zwfw.ch.mnr.gov.cn/result/matterdetial?appId=4028fb8351193e4e0151194302a50001

5、怎么判断地图有没有错绘漏绘

**Dear Sellers:**

AliExpress is always committed to maintaining an orderly marketplace in compliance with all local laws, regulations and providing consumers with safe and high-quality goods. In order to protect the rights and interests of platform users, AliExpress (hereinafter referred to as "AliExpress" or "Platform") will strengthen control over the following products:

\[Prohibited Products\]
-----------------------

Laser products have been strictly controlled in many countries and regions around the world. Laser products may be hazardous to people who contact with such products and may be life-threatening in severe cases. Authorities in various countries have issued warnings to consumers about such products, and some high-power laser products are even recognized as weapons in some countries.

Prohibited products include but are not limited to the following types:

\[Control measures\]
--------------------

AliExpress will strictly control laser products (including laser pens, laser toys, laser sights, etc.). Except for the penalty under the existing prohibited and restricted sales rules (prohibition on the sale of laser pen products with a transmitting power greater than 5 mw: general violation, 1 point/time; serious violation, 6 points/time) , AliExpress requests the Sellers that:

1、All products involving lasers should contain the maximum output power of the product in the product title and/or attributes (such as the maximum output power (Max. Output Power) under the category Computers and Offices > Office Electronics > Administrative and Financial Equipment > Laser Pens)., otherwise it may be punished by being removed from the shelves for the first time and editable, and being deleted twice after February 24 2024;

2、For laser products with a transmission power greater than 1 mw and less than or equal to 5 mw, such products are prohibited in the EU, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.

Sellers shall list and sell products in accordance with applicable rules and abide by applicable laws and regulations of any country of origin and any country of destination. Where any Seller is found to be listing products or releasing information in violation of the rules, AliExpress will delist or delete the related products or information and punish the violator in accordance with relevant rules. For a Seller that knowingly circumvents the rules, provides information about prohibited products in any interaction scenarios (e.g., chats, live-streaming), violates the rules repeatedly, is criticized in any form of media circulated by a regulator, receives negative publicity published by media, or commits any other serious violation, AliExpress will impose penalties, including but not limited to deleting product information, deducting points, blocking stores, restricting access to the website's product features, and freezing or even closing the account, in accordance with the platform's relevant rules.

Notes on Regulations Governing the Export of Biocide Products

Background
----------

Biocide products refer to products that kill pathogenic microorganisms among humans and in the environment we live, or inhibit their growth, or counteract their pathogenic action. Biocide products imported into the US are divided into two categories: antimicrobial pesticides for disinfecting ordinary environmental and hard surfaces, which are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and falling within the scope of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); and antiseptics for disinfecting critical medical devices and different parts of the body (like skin and hand), which are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This page mainly describes the regulatory requirements for the **second category**.

Biocide products imported into the EU are subject to the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) which sets out explicit rules for Biocide products and their active substances. Biocide products are allowed to be placed on the EU market only if they comply with applicable requirements.

Scope
-----

Biocide products on this page mainly refer to hand sanitizers and wet wipes regulated by the FDA. Only three active ingredients, **benzalkonium chloride, alcohol (ethyl alcohol or ethanol, 60%-95%) and isopropanol (70%-91.3%)**, are eligible for usage.

Biocide products marketed the EU market refer to biocides for human health falling within the scope of the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) (Regulation (EU) 528/2012), such as **hand sanitizers, gel hand sanitizers and disinfectants for private and public spaces**.

Regulations
-----------

In the US, Biocide products are over-the-counter (OTC) topical antimicrobial drug products that are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as OTC drugs, which shall be subject to establishment registration, National Drug Code (NDC) number assignment and drug listing requirements before they are placed on the market. Furthermore, Biocide products shall be manufactured according to the current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and conform to the requirements on content and format of labeling under 21 CFR Part 201 Subpart C.

According to the EU BPR, all biocidal products require an authorization before they can be placed on the market, and the active substances contained in a biocidal product must have been approved previously. There are, however, certain exceptions to this principle. There are associated labeling requirements, covering the name and address of the authorization holder, authorized use, authorization number and categories of users to which a biocidal product is restricted. You should also ensure the labels are written in the official language(s) of the Member State(s) in which you offer the product for sale or supply. It is your responsibility to provide accurate and complete product information about biocidal products. In addition to compliance with the BPR, a registration under the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation is required for biocidal products if the non-active substances contained reach the threshold of 1 ton per year and are not included in the Exemption List. Manufacturers shall comply with the Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation for the classification, labeling and packaging of biocidal products and prepare Safety Data Sheets (SDS) under EU regulations.

Legal Basis
